Your love and sympathy is all for show.
What do you think...
Did you think I didn't understand it?
And auntie, I didn't do all of this.
You did this.
He's here to take me away...
Ask him.... Arhum you're lying, right?
Let him go...
I married my sister to you with honor.
I didn't sell her to you to do anything you want.
Get away uncle!
He's my father, you cannot touch him!
Mother...
Will you leave us like father?
No... no my dear. How can I leave you?
No... I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.
Your mother is not going anywhere.
I'm right here with you. Don't be afraid.
Being worried won't solve your problems Arhum.
I don't care about my problems. I'm concerned about my daughter. She should be playing at her age...
not going through what she is... this is not good for my kids.
As a father, it's my duty to protect my kids.
And I think that it's necessary for my kids to be here.
If you want, can I talk to Sanaya?
There is no point in you talking to her. She's furious...
and I don't want her to make a drastic decision.
I think that you should talk to Sanaya alone.
Not in front of her family. That won't solve anything.
That's not possible... where can I meet her? She doesn't pick up... there's no way.
You can meet her at the office as well.
I'm sure she'll be weary of her surroundings and talk to you.
Shenaya... come and eat. You haven't eaten since morning.
I'm no hungry...
I have no intention to live.
You'll have to eat to live.
If not for yourself, then for your kids.
The life you see in me...
is because of my kids.
You're going through a bad period, it will pass.
Sometimes bad periods end everything.
Everything is over before it even began...
I'm your mother my dear... I'm living because of you.
If you lose hope then how will I live?
I'm shattered mother.
Arhum has taken away my right to live.
Everything is over.
My dear... don't worry...
Did you talk to the estate agent about the house for rent?
Alright, ready the agreement tomorrow. We'll finalize it tomorrow. I'll see you on my way home from work
No.
No...
Fabiha... no... no...
Hareem!
Hareem!
Hareem is not here.
Mother.
Come have breakfast, after that I'll give you your medicine.
Did Shenaya eat... when I went to her room, she was readying Hadi.
She said that she would eat... I'm sure she hasn't.
Mothers take care of everyone, but who takes care of mothers. How can a mother eat when her children haven't.
Mother... Shenaya ate...
I was hard for her, but she did. Now please have breakfast, so that I may give you medicine.
Is that the truth?
Yes mother, why would I lie to you?
Now have breakfast, so that I may give you medicine.
Alright fine...
Shenaya didn't eat anything last night as well. I don't know why she chooses to live in pain.
Mother, she has to live with that pain for the rest of her life... the wounds that brother Arhum gave her won't heal so easily.
You're right... a wound a man gives a woman, make her hollow inside.
Then only a desire for love is left inside.
But when a woman decides...
then she become very strong.
You're right.
I just want her to salvage her life and not be ruined.
I cannot face Shenaya's problems for her...
Mother... but you can pray...
Pray for her all the time, so that you may find peace and so does Shenaya...
Let's have breakfast.
Come on.
My God... let's go.
Auntie get up I've brought you breakfast.
I'll wash your face, then you can have breakfast.
Alright?
I don't want to eat.
Go away.
Why are you being stubborn? You'll get sick.
Please don't take out your anger on the food.
I'm keeping it here, be sure to have it.
God please bless my daughter's fate.
My Lord, protect my daughter and her children.
Shelter her from the slightest pain. 
Create softness in Arhum's heart. 
You listen to all prayers... please listen to mine as well.
I ask you for this... I dare not ask it of anyone.
You know the matter of the heart. Please bless my daughter with happiness.
Amen... Amen...
Bless us.
Let's hurry up...
Mother... you've put the tie on backwards...
Sorry my dear... sorry...
Hareem... hurry up...
Mother... sister Hareem is not here.
With father.
Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget. We're running late.
Let's go... good boy...
Let's go.
Auntie Fabiha...
No auntie Fabiha... from now on you'll call me little mother...
Little mother?
But my mother is at granny's house.
That's is true... but she's your elder mother, whereas I'm your little mother.
Little mother? But one can only have one mother.
When you love someone so much...
And when you like someone... you like me, right?
Yes.
Then you take care of what they like and dislike. And I would like it if you call me little mother.
Alright... then from now on I'll call you little mother...
Promise?
Promise...
Then let's get ready, where are your shoes?
Here's your water bottle and here's you school bag, lets' go.
There are a few things missing in aisle number fourteen...
Hamza...
You didn't come into work for the past few days.
I wasn't feeling well.
Mother was worried for you... she thinks of you like her son
There is a difference between thinking and actually being. Ask her to be concerned about her daughter.
What should she show concern for? She hasn't returned since that day.
We don't where she is and how she's doing.
We've asked friends and neighbors, but we learned nothing.
I have said a prayer in Fabiha's name.
Forget about this..
I talked to my boss about you. Send your details into HR tomorrow, God willing things will work out.
No... there is no need for that. I've sold the house.
I don't need it anymore. I'll return the loan tomorrow. Thanks anyways.
Who lives in your home?
My sister and mother.
Wow... you're lucky that you have your sister, I have no one.
Then make me your sister... a good friend.
Really?
Yes.
Here is your apple juice.
Muskan!
Don't you dare take anything from her.
It's just apple juice...
Why are you being angry at Muskan?
She's my daughter and I'll do as I please.
There's no trusting you, you could add poison to this.
Why would I do that? Are you insane?
Mother... auntie Fabiha made it in front of me.
Silence! Can't you see we're talking. I don't want to see you near her!
Hareem!
Mother!
My child... are you okay my dear?
Yes...
Let's sit here...
Show me... how are you?
Show me...
What are you looking at?
Did auntie Fabiha say something to you? Did she scold you or hit you?
No... little mother is very good. She takes care of me.
Little mother?
Who told you this? Auntie Fabiha...
She asked me to call her that from now on.
She's my mother as well.
No
I'm your only mother.
You are my elder mother.
Does father know about this?
Yes, father knows... and she lives with us as well.
My dear child... don't share this with anyone
Not with your friends or your teachers... promise?
Promise.
Good girl.
Mother...
When will you return home?
I don't know child...
You're upset with me, right?
No my dear... how can I be upset with my child?
Is it because I went with father?
I thought that Hadi was with you...
That's why I decided to go with father, because he's alone.
Don't you have a class to go to? You'll be late.
I'll come back to meet you later...
What did Hareem say to you?
She told Hareem that she's her little mother and I'm her elder mother.
I cannot leave my daughter with a step mother.
She stole everything from me. My house... my husband.
Before she steals my children from me...
I have to bring Hareem back.
If I see you near her again..
What happened... why are you scolding her?
Make her understand mother...
She's with Fabiha everyday. She'll turn my daughter against me.
Enough... nothing like that will happen.
Why won't it? She was giving her apple juice.
What if she adds something to it?
My God you're becoming just as superstitious as your in-laws.
Think whatever you want. She's my only child and I wont risk her.
Alright fine, enough! Don't scare her...
I'll scold your mother... go play with your sister.
Enough... come sit here.
What's the matter with you mother?
Tell me.
What will we do with Fabiha? Have you planned anything?
You'll leave in a few days, then what will happen to me?
I've lost my daughter-in-law and my caretaker.
That girl...
who used to come here, bathe me and dress me up...
Do you know what she told me?
She told me that she doesn't care...
if I have tea or not... she doesn't care that I take my insulin...
or not...
What will happen to me?
What did I do?
Mother.
Fabiha is confident because she knows that sister Shenaya has no value in this house.
If you and I work together to bring sister Shenaya back...
only then we can defeat Fabiha...
Besides...
Sister Shenaya is mother to my brother's children
She is strong that way.
If she comes back.
Only then will Fabiha know her actual worth.
I'll enjoy watching Fabiha squirm.
What's the matter Fabiha?
What happened?
Auntie didn't take her insulin. I also know that she won't have breakfast as well, please talk to her before you leave.
I don't want her to get sick.
Don't worry... my mother is a little strict. It will take her a little time.
I know how she is Arhum.
Her anger is justified, I'm not worried about her anger.
I'm worried that she might harm herself because of her anger.
I'll talk to her... she'll listen. Don't worry.
Come home early today.
Alright... I have a meeting, but I will try.
Alright... Hareem's van guy said that he won't be picking her up on his way back. Please pick her up.
Don't worry, I will.
Alright.
Shenaya, didn't you go to work today?
I'll go in late.
If you're going to work late, then where are you coming from now?
I went to school to meet Hareem.
And did you meet her?
If you just met your daughter then why aren't you relieved? Why are you worried?
Hareem's childhood is lost.
She is hearing things that she shouldn't. Fabiha is saying thing that she ought not say to her.
What did Hareem tell you?
She told her that she's her little mother and I'm her elder mother.
I cannot leave my daughter with a step mother. She has taken everything away from me, my husband... my house...
Before she takes my children from me, I'll have to bring Hareem back here.
I know how hard this time is for a woman. A time where her husband chooses another woman over her.
No woman likes to see her place being taken away by another woman.
But... there are many women in the world who tolerate this...
And they are tolerating.
What do you want me to do mother?
Should I become like the rest?
Should I tolerate my husband's cruelty out of fear of  my in-laws?
Why? Because he's a man?
He can do everything...
Men will always remember their right of marrying for women as per Islam. But they always forget to provide the rights of women.
When a woman can work to maintain his home...
When she can cook... when she can take care of his kids...
when she can take care of his parents... then why does a man forget her loyalty...
and pursues marriage to different women. What more could I have done to gain Arhum's loyalty?
My dear, women have always been the ones to sacrifice.
She sacrifices for her husband... she sacrifices for her kids...
All she does is sacrifice.
But I won't do that mother.
I will raise a voice for my right. I will set an example for all women.
I have fulfilled all my duties. I don't fear anyone. I just want my daughter back.
What do you want to do? I just want my kids to be with my mother.
First make a decision about your life. What do you want?
That is more important.
Right now I want to stay alone with my children.
Do you want the kids to be divided between their mother and father?
If men think about this before marrying then most men would not marry for the second time.
It takes two to dance.
If men are wrong, then so are women. Both have an equal blame in it.
For a man it is important for his woman to be loyal, which I was with Arhum.
I didn't make a mistake in fulfilling my duties, if I had...
I would have tolerated Arhum's disloyalty silently.
I'm no wrong...
That's why I have decided.
What have you decided Shenaya?
You still haven't had breakfast.
Why?
Hadia is making it for me. Don't worry.
It's been so many days since you took your insulin.
This cannot carry on.
If you were so concerned about your mother.
Then you should have listened to me on the first day.
Fabiha used to take care of you before... she was the one who gave you insulin, then why are you reacting like this?
When you are happy with someone who works for you, you praise them, not give them a share in the property.
Everyone has their place...
You should deal with them, keeping that in mind.
You can be sympathetic with a beggar, or help him, but you won't bring him home.
She shed a few tears and you were manipulated by her.
I didn't think you were so were so foolish.
I didn't expect you to be so foolish.
What have you decided then? What's the solution for this?
You might leave your wife, but you cannot stay away from your kids...
I'm trying to convince Shenaya... and I will continue to do so until she agrees.
She will only agree when you let her go
Shenaya is upset... you are upset and you know that I don't have a choice.
If you care about our happiness, then take her to her home.
That won't happen.
You know I won't do that.
I am the one who should be punished...
Stand by me please.
Give Fabiha a chance.
For  me.
It is worrisome. Did you talk to her, or did she talk to you?
No, did something happen?
I'm so worried. She was about to make a decision.
Don't worry... whatever she decides to do, she'll tell us...
She has told me that she has decided.
Alright fine... I'll talk to her... don't worry. I don't want you getting unwell.
How can I not stress? She's my child, just like you are.
She has children... why aren't they thinking about their children?
Why are they punishing them?
You know that one is helpless in front of their fate. I'll talk to her...
And I'll try to stop her if she takes a bad decision. You trust me, right?
My dear.... you're the only I can trust.
Make your sister understand. Ask her to work on the matter...
Ask her to reconsider.
Alright I'll say that to her.
Don't worry please... don't stress..
Alright? Did you take your medicine?
Yes I did... please talk to her.
Alright... I will.
Mother...
I'm dead to you and you're dead to me.
Mother, don't say that. Listen to me... don't hang up.
Don't try to call her again.
Mother, please listen to me.
Junaid...
What's the matter? You look worried... is everything okay?
Everything is fine...
No.
Your face doesn't say the same.
I'm worried because of Shenaya.
She's in a troubled situation.
Yes she is...
Mother is worried... she's asking me to ask Shenaya about her decision.
Ask mother to no worry... I'll call Shenaya and talk to her.
Do you think you should talk to her?
Yes, why not?
I'll call her at night and ask her everything.
Alright...
Talk to her... tell me what she says.
How was your day?
It was fine...
I trusted you.
I trusted you with my kids and husband.
But you didn't think once before betraying me. You betrayed my children, who you took care of!
What would you have done it was me who had taken away your husband from you?
I'm sure you would have been able to do nothing.
I know that you must be happy ruining me.
You will never have happiness as well.
I didn't want to ruin anyone.
Could you find no one other than my husband?
It's easy to lead a lonely man astray.
Your responsibilities left him alone.
And you took advantage of that.
You didn't even think about taking a father away from his children.
Don't you dare say the things that you saying to Hareem...
I might have tolerated you taking my husband...
but for my kids I will never forgive you...
I don't want anything like that.
Don't be proud of your luck, he's a man...
he wasn't loyal to me... why would he be loyal to you?
Men are famous for their disloyalty..
Forgive him... and come back home.
I will.
But when you get out of our lives...
Decide then...
It's not easy for a woman to sacrfice everything and then leave her husband.
That's what I'm going through!
You've hurt me...  and you will never be happy...
Never.
