Make space and keep this bag. Hadia come we're getting late for the airport. Come Muskaan.
What were you doing? 
 Nothing.
Hadia, your brother doesn't have time to see you off. Come. We're getting late. Come Muskaan.
Come dear.. Hadia..
You're upset with me and leaving? 
 Yes. I'm upset and leaving.
Do you know brother..
when daughters leave their father's and brother's house upset, their brothers are never happy.
I'm just afraid of this.
Hadia, I don't know what I said to you when I was angry. Please I'm really sorry. Don't be upset.
Brother, we get upset with the ones we love.
And, I have nobody who loves me in this house.
Bye.
Mom, Hamza took me to have ice cream. 
 Oh wow. What was the happy occasion?
You should ask Hamza about that.
 Whats the occasion you're celebrating with ice creams?
I got a promotion today and a car from the company.
Here mom.. your breakfast.
Mom? What happened? Where are you lost? 
 Nothing. I was just thinking..
When a man has a woman in his life, his fate changes.
Ever since Fabiha left Hamza, Hamza's luck has sky rocketed.
Fabiha didn't have true love in her fate, neither did she have peace.
She will now keep burning with her desire when Hamza has another woman in his life.
Mom.. when God didn't create Fabiha and Hamza in a pair, what could we do?
You shouldn't worry about Hamza getting married. He'll marry when he's ready. 
 He'll only be able to forget Fabiha, when there will be someone else in his life.
I'll ask Sumbul to send me some pictures of girls.
Maybe he'll like a girl from them. Then, you, I and Haniya will go with a proposal and get him married.
I think Hamza is here. Mom, we'll leave for work. 
 Dear, you didn't even have tea.
I'll have it in the office. We're getting late. Take care. Bye.
Hello. 
 Hello.
Hamza drop me at the bus stop on our way back, today.
Why? Is everything alright? Why on the bus stop? 
 Yes. I have to go to the market for something.
Yes. Which market? 
 This mall nearby. I have to come here.
So I'll take you. 
 Hamza, why will you be disturbed because of me. I'll go myself.
Farheen, I like to help family. Can we go now?
Hello mom.. 
 Hello? Where were you? I've been calling you since long.
Yes actually I went to drop Hadia to the airport. 
 Yes, Soumya told me.
That's fine. You tell me are you okay? Is everything okay between you and Arham?
Yes mom. Everything is fine. 
 Does he give you time? Does he take care of your needs?
Yes mom, he does. 
 You're lucky that he values you over the other woman.
This mean, he loves you, dear. And now its your duty to return his love, with love.
God knows, which mothers teach their daughters the wrong thing. A man is a leader.
No matter what he does wrong, its a woman's fault in the end.
You cannot change his natural instinct.
A husband also values his wife as much as a wife values her husband.
You should treat Arham like you used to. With the same love and same care. Understand?
There's a meeting being called, mom. I'll talk to you late. Bye. 
 Alright. Bye.
You know we're working people. Friendship and bosses don't mix.
There are some rules of the bank that we cannot change.
The same rules are for me as well. You will have an idea how much time it takes to approve a loan.
But I'll get your case processed but keep in mind that it will take about two months.
Yes, I understand. Thank you. You're so busy but still you managed some time for me. Thank you.
Its alright. Why are you embarrassing me? 
 I'll leave mow.
Why? Have tea with me. 
 No, thank you. One second..
Yes Farrukh?
Handle it for a while. I'm coming. I'll leave now, I have a call from work. 
 Sure. See you.
What do you think? You'll destroy everything and I'll compromise? Don't even think about it. I built this house with love and your greed destroyed it.
Whether I get Arham or not, but you'll not stay in Arham's life for long. I promise you.
The speed at which the kids are being detached from me, this way Sanaya will also take Arham away.
And I'll not let this happen. I need to keep the kids close to keep Arham close.
Fabiha didn't have true love in her fate and neither peace.
She will keep burning with her desires when Hamza has another woman in his life.
How are you Farheen? 
 I'm fine. How are you?
You had a shift upstairs. Has it changed again? 
 It didn't change. I got it changed.
What do you mean? I don't understand. 
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yes sure.. 
 How is Hamza related to you? You come and go with him. Is he your brother?
Why are you so concerned about Hamza? Who is he to me? Who I come and go with, shouldn't concern you.
Mind your own business. Why do you keep an eye out for others? 
 Oh, I was just asking.
To tell you the truth. I like Hamza. I want to talk to him.
I thought I'd ask you. You might give me a favor. But you're more possessive about him than me.
What's the scene? But you and him have a big age difference.
Stay in your limit, or else. 
 Is everything alright?
Hamza, please leave from here.
Farheen, let me talk. What happened Faryal? 
 Nothing. I'll tell you. You leave from here.
Oh but wait.. What happened? 
 I'll tell you. Why do you have to talk to her? Come.
Listen to me.. 
A wife is as important to a husband as the husband is important to his wife.
You should be treating Arham like before. With the same love and care.
The kids aren't home yet? Soumya? Soumya? 
 Yes?
Why haven't Hareem and Hadi here yet? Its been more than half an hour. Do you have the van driver's number?
Call him. 
 No mom. I deleted it. 
I'll call Sanaya and ask. 
 Please do.
Sanaya, isn't answering. She must be in a meeting. How will we know about the kids now?
Wait. Let me call. 
 Okay.
Yes Soumya? 
 Sanaya, the kids aren't home yet.
The kids aren't home yet? I'll ask. 
 Yes please then tell me.
She's telling me. Don't worry. 
 Yes. They should be here by now.
Where are the kids? 
 Mam, she was insisting to take the kids along.
How can you just send the kids with someone else? You should have informed me at least.
Arham, where are the kids? 
 They are with Fabiha.
So tell me what was Faryal telling you? 
 I told you she said nothing. Why are you chanting her name?
Why are you fighting? There is something she said that irritated you so much. Oh well...
Its up to you. Don't tell me if you don't want to. 
 Really? She likes you.
She wants to talk to you. Do you want me to get her number for you? 
 Yes. Of course.
Go. She is in the crockery section. Go and take her number. Why are you making me act like a messenger?
Whats wrong with you Farheen? Why are you so irritated? And why are you arguing with her because of me? Are you mad?
And even if she likes me. Its not her fault. I am so handsome. 
 Are you done?
Nobody can take Fabiha's place.
Hamza.. Fabiha's chapter is closed. She has moved on in life. Please, you also move on.
Fabiha's chapter is closed. She has moved on in life. Please you also move on. 
Did you enjoy? 
 We had a lot of fun. Mom.. will you take us out again?
Of course, we'll go and next time we'll take you dad along too.
Yes. Then I'll show them my stickers as well. Mom! Mom's here.
Mom, do you know, mom took us to play area and then I got this sticker.
And mom bought us all these toys too. 
 Quiet! Silence!
I told you not to.
You will only come home on the van except mom. You didn't take mom's permission and came with someone else?
Mom.. she's our mom too.. 
 She isn't your mom! Do you understand?!
And you.. how dare you get my children without my permission?
I was just.. 
 I don't want your clarifications. Get out of my house. Right now. I don't want you near my children!
Get out. 
 You cannot throw me out of my husband's house!
What are you doing? 
 Ask your husband to find another place for you!
Sanaya listen to me. Sanaya!
Sanaya, open the door. Where will I go? Why are you doing all this?
Sanaya, open the door. What are you doing? People are watching. Open the door, please.
What happened? 
 Sanaya...
If I see you near Fabiha aunty, you'll see the worse of me. Do you both understand?
I am a woman but I'm not weak.
You will not hit me while your other wife is watching!
Sanaya, what about what you're doing? 
 Whatever a mother should be doing.
She took my permission. 
 My permission is important as well. They are not only your children.
My permission is as important as yours.
Sanaya, she's my wife. She has the same respect as you in this house.
So please.. 
 If she's your wife, don't ask her to mother my children!
If she roams around my children after today..
I'll not hold back. 
 Do you know she cannot answer back? But she tolerates for me.
She loves me. Why can't you adjust? I didn't commit a sin marrying for the second time?
No. I'm the one who committed a sin. I loved you and you punished me like this..
I never thought about it.
I have been patient about you but the children are mine.
If I see her near my children again..
Come on both of you. 
 You're wrong.
Fabiha..
Mom, are you crying?
Please, don't cry.
Here, drink some water.
Mom is alright. Don't worry. Come here. 
 Mom..
Are you upset with us? 
 Not at all my dear.
How can I be upset with you? Mom isn't angry at all. Okay? 
 Okay.
Mom, we are really sorry. Please.
Please don't cry. 
 Its okay dear. Mom is alright. I'm not crying. Don't worry.
Come to me. Both of you. Mom isn't upset at all.
Fabiha, what are you doing? 
 I shouldn't have come in your life. Ever since I married you, I've been insulted.
Where are you going? 
 I'll go anywhere, Arham.
Fabiha, listen to me carefully. You're not going anywhere.
And this isn't my decision but my order. 
 Don't you see she hates me so much? How will I make a place in her heart?
Who is asking you to do that? 
 So will we keep fighting?
I want to live with everyone together. I want to build a home. 
 Nothing will be alright so soon Fabiha.
I think it never will be. What mistake did I make if I took the kids outside?
What is wrong if they spent some good time? I used to take care of them earlier.
Now Sanaya wants me to leave the kids alone. 
 Then do it.
For some time. Stay away from the kids and Sanaya. 
 What are you saying?
I cannot stay away from the kids. We're attached to one another. What are you saying?
Fabiha, try to understand. Sanaya is right too. Its difficult to adjust for her.
Please for my sake. Stay away from Sanaya and the kids. I promise you, everything will be alright.
Now keep this back.
Listen.. lets go for dinner tonight. Okay?
Relax. Won't you smile?
Hello mom. 
 Hello. Did you get your salary?
You shopped so much. Do you know how much bill we have?
How much? 
 7000.
7000? How did we use so much electricity to get such a hefty bill?
Thats what I'm telling you. Did you save something or spent everything?
All this.. Hamza has been promoted, mom..
So he got you and me a gift.
See this.. this is for you. 
 Why did you have to spend so much?
Didn't you tell him no? Why did you let him spend so much? 
 Farheen said no to me.
But this made me happy. Can I not buy something for my mother? 
 Mom, do you know, after his promotion,
Hamza's salary has tripled. Hamza's days have changed. 
 This is great news.
Now when you call me your mother and think of me as one. Do your duty as a son. I won't hear no.
Whatever you order. Tell me what it is. 
 See this.
These are a few pictures of girls that I've chosen for you. Look at them and then we'll talk.
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Fabiha..
Happy birthday to you..
Do you have an affair with him? 
 Yes. I do have an affair with him. I love him!
I don't want to live with you. What will I do living with you? What will you give me? Poverty? Hunger?!
I have already freed myself from this relationship since long and its best if Hamza does it too.
But.. 
 There's no room to say no.
Actually I don't want to get married before Haniya does.
Haniya is very young. We'll get her married when its the right time. We should think about you first.
I'll think about it. I'll leave now. Please allow me. Bye.
Mom.. why did you have to discuss this with Hamza right now? He seemed so disturbed.
But we have to get him married. He should settle down.
Ouch.. 
 Sanaya, show me..
You have done your part clearing my path of thorns.
I don't need anymore sympathies. 
 Sanaya, you're bleeding. Sanaya listen..
