If you don't want to go with him then refuse.
What is there to be afraid of?
Besides, some decisions in life..
one has to fight.
Better than providing excuses everyday, why not get it over with?
Am I lying? Have you not seen the state of mother.
You might have faith in your wife, but I do not.
Fabiha is far much better than her, she at least cares about our mother.
I think you should double her money and ask her to stay the night, so that she may insert insulin.
Will you have coffee?
Thank you.
How did you know that I wanted to have a cup of coffee?
I was making for one myself and decided to make another for you.
How did you know that I liked coffee?
You don't know this, but my horoscope is the same as your wife.
How did you know that?
I found a picture on the lounge. It has a date on it. I'm sure you must have gifted it to her.
Thank you.
I should be the one thanking you. One needs a partner to have coffee with and you've fulfilled that for  me.
It's time for you to go.
I'll go home a little late today. After inserting auntie with insulin.
Miss Shenaya stays busy and she'll be late today. We can't risk it.
Late?
Did she not tell you?
I'm sure she told me, it must have slipped my mind.
I overheard her talking on the phone. She has dinner at 8.
That's why I assumed that she might be late.
Don't worry. I'll take care of the insulin duties at night.
Father! Father, look at this. My friend gave me this.
Very nice...
Happy friendship day auntie Fabiha...
Happy friendship day! Is this for me?
Yes.
From now on you're my best friend.
You are my best friend as well.
And mine too.
The kids have gotten quite attached to you.
Kids go where they find love.
"I love you"
I love you too Hadi!
Show me what you friend gave you.
My friend gave you this...
Wow... this is beautiful... the color are so well done.
Very nice.
Fabiha...
Fabiha...
Yes...
What are you thinking about?
Nothing...
There is something... tell me, I won't tell anyone.
Look at me. Tell me.
What's the reason that you seem worried to me?
If I tell you something, promise me that you won't tell anyone else.
Why would I? I'm your sister..
I can keep that a secret.
Auntie said something very weird to me today.
What's that?
She told me that I should include myself in Arhum's life.
Are you saying that mother is paralyzed because of me?
Yes!
If you had given my mother her insulin on time, she would be walking today!
You should have thought before alleging me with something so big.
Admit that you've made a mistake!
What?
Did she really say that to you?
I can't believe it..
I didn't either.
But... why does she want that?
She thinks that miss Shenaya can't give her the happiness that I can.
You always lie to hide you mistakes... admit your mistake!
Mother...
Yes my dear... what's the matter?
What happened?
Are you two fighting?
No... not at all...
Like how you scolded when you do something wrong..
just like that father was scolding me.
Nothing else... let's go to your room.
Tell me, what did you two eat for dinner?
She is right.
If a man has money..
then it doesn't matter if he's old, or has a second marriage.
He would keep you happy as well. He has a home, a car and a good bank balance...
Not only will he fulfill your desires, but your dreams as well.
But sister...
But what...
Look, life doesn't knock often at one's door.
Don't let this doubt ruin your life.
Don't let this ruin someone's life.
Don't you think that marrying a married man, spoils a women's reputation?
I have a question... when Islam allows men to marry four times at a single time...
then why do people taunt only the women?
That she married a married man.
Why is a woman's reputation scrutinized? Why is she kept out of the loop?
Why isn't she given the same stature as the first wife.
Even though a man is following the teachings of Islam when he's marrying a second woman.
And a woman does a lawful thing by marrying.
Look Fabiha...
There is no reason for you to go this deep.
Just tell me... do you want to do this?
Do you want to marry Arhum?
I want to marry him and secure all of our futures.
And Hamza?
What about him?
I've tried using my behavior to push him away, but what can I do if he still comes after me?
Do you think he'll leave you so easily?
I don't want to talk about Hamza for now.
Alright.
That means that you've decided.
Hamza has no job or status...
He'll have to sell his house to repay the loan.
Better than living on the streets with him, it would be better if I live in Arhum's palace.
You're right... every person has the right to think about their future.
It's good that you're thinking about your future.
Look at me...
What did I get being loyal to Haris. My life has been ruined.
These are not the times for being loyal. One has to be selfish.
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks...
That person won't pay for your bills or your ration.
People talk and then they leave...
People like us fear what people might say and close doors that are better for us.
Do you remember my childhood friend Tamanna? Samreen told me that she married a married man.
What doesn't she have now? She has a house, bank balance and a huge car...
Samreen told me that she goes on a trip every two months. London... US... or Turkey.
Fabiha, there is nothing wrong if you have to endure a first wife and her kids to get all these luxuries.
Islam give equal stature to both wives...
There is nothing wrong with having a lawful relationship.
Why are you getting worried?
You can think about it later. It's getting late, go to sleep.
Arhum.
Arhum!
Come inside.
Yes mother.
Come here... sit here.
Are you worried?
No, I just couldn't sleep.
Why?
What's the matter? Tell me...
You're in this state because of me.
I don't like that.
Who told you that I'm in this state because of you? Why you taking blame of your wife's actions?
Look...
There are so many women...
They manage their work and home lives so well.
What can I say if Shenaya can't do that?
Look at Fabiha.
She takes care of me all day here and then she goes home to take care of her family.
She's even younger than Shenaya.
It's all about how she was raised..
Her mother raised her well.
She is tolerating everything her mother is doing to her.
On her say so she's willing to marry.
Shall I ask you something?
Fabiha so quickly made a place in your heart...
Shenaya couldn't do that in all these years.
Why is that?
She never tried.
It is easy to build a relationship with one's husband.
But it's hard to accept the relationships around him.
Look...
how Fabiha takes care of me all day.
Sometimes I feel as though she's my daughter-in-law, and not Shenaya.
If it were up to me, I would not let her go...
What are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up.
You are wasting your time.
I will not cheer up.
Cheer up...
Leave it...
I won't.
Let go of my shirt.
I won't, until you cheer up.
Shenaya...
Cheer up, otherwise you'll look like a fool in front of the kids...
Wear this shirt instead.
Are you two fighting?
Like the wrestling we watch...
No... who told you this?
We know everything.
You are upset with mother.
It's nothing like that. I can never be upset with your mother.
Then wear this shirt that mother is giving you.
I will wear it right now.
Thank you... because of you two mother agreed.
Let's go...
Why aren't you ready yet?
Where are you going, getting ready so early in the morning?
The kids have their results today. Miss Shenaya is busy, so I'll have to go in her place.
Whilst taking care of his mother, have you become a nanny for the kids?
When they increased your responsibilities, then why not your salary?
One day won't make a difference.
Yes... it does.
I don't understand why you're working yourself for other people's kids. 
Where are you going so early in the morning?
Mother... I asked Samreen to find me a job. She's gotten me into an interview, and that's where I'm going.
There is no respectable job for someone who has just passed matriculation.
Go and take care of the kitchen. Forget about this.
Why mother? Why am I responsible for the respect of our home? I can't work inside the kitchen any longer.
I've decided that I will find a job, build my life and establish myself.
Like Fabiha, I want to have job.
I wait for one daughter the entire day.
Is that enough for me? Don't test me further... please go.
What's the matter mother? You never had a problem with Fabiha's job, then why me?
If I had worked a job like Fabiha since the beginning, then I too would be confident.
You are confident right now. That sharp tongue that you have...
You know how to use it well.
Mother I've told you... I'll work a job.
Working women have a particular approach to life and a desire to move forward.
and if I had thought of that before, Haris might not have left me.
So I've decided, I'll work a job...
Farewell.
You have freed yourself from my responsibility a long time ago
Go and have fun.
Mother, she's leaving for an important meeting.
What did I say?
Everyone has their priorities.
For some people family is more important, and for some their future.
It's all about making the right decision at the right time.
Fabiha... listen to me...
He stands there like an idiot.
What's with you? Do you think it's funny?
Yes we do, what will you do about it?
Do you want me to show how funny it is?
Hadi...
Bye...
Open the door.
I'm leaving Arhum...
Let me know once you've reached.
Fabiha...
Are you crying?
No... I was chopping onions.
You can lie... but not your tears.
If you didn't like something that Shenaya said then for that...
It's nothing like that... you have it wrong...
What is the matter, tell me? Is it something personal?
Did you talk to mother?
If I tell you, will it fix it?
It might not, but it might life a burden.
When one has an ill fate, then all burden become very cheap.
How long can you stay strong when you have burden on top of you?
But I'll have to.
A lot of people are counting on me...
I'm the son of my house.
Did you talk to Arhum?
I called him so many times, but he isn't picking up. I was thinking of visiting him.
What will that do? Will he listen to you? He will never listen.
It's a matter of my daughter, we can't just leave him like this.
I was thinking of taking Arhum out for dinner somewhere.
Let's do that.
I think you should let them be.
It's not only about Arhum, Shenaya's happiness is linked to him.
I don't want Shenaya to listen to anything because of us.
I was thinking of going with you tomorrow to invite Arhum and his mother.
You can try, but he will not come.
For the time being we have to do something.
Take me to his home... 
tomorrow.
May I come in sir?
Yes.
The client from Islamabad liked the project you sent over. Congratulations!
They want to have a meeting as well.
Really sir... that's great!
This project is very important for us. You have put in a lot of effort.
I expect you to lock this deal.
If God is willing.
One more thing... you have a meeting with the client tonight. I have confirmed your tickets.
Sufiya and Zain are going with you as well. You have to go.
Go home and start packing.
Sure sir.
Thank you.
Hello.
Arhum...
What is it?
I wanted to tell you that auntie's medicine are finished. Be sure to get them on your way back.
Alright I will.
Nothing.
Yes Shenaya?
There is a problem..
I have to go to an urgent meeting in Islamabad tonight and stay there for two days. It's a huge client!
Alright, don't worry. Go there...
But... Arhum, how can I leave the kids alone?
I don't understand.
Don't worry..
I'll take care of the kids... do you work.
Arhum, are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure... relax and go.
Thank you Arhum.
Okay...
Bye, take care.
Thank you.
Fabiha, will you pass me the make up pouch? Thank you.
You have to wake up on time, eat on time and sleep on time. Don't bother your father.
Have you prepared my dress?
I'm so sorry?
What will I wear now?
I forgot.
Fabiha... will you do me a favor? Could you wash Hadi's sport dress?
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. It's important for you to go.
Thank you so much.
Mother...
Why are you going? How will we live alone?
You're not alone, father is with you.
But you're not
I'll be back soon.
When will you be back?
On Sunday.
Promise?
Promise.
Mother, can't we come with you?
How can you go? You have to go to school and attend classes.
If you don't go to school, then your marks will be deducted from your final exams.
Take away the kids Fabiha.
Come on kids... let your mom pack.
Fabiha, close the door on your way out.
What?
I've pressed your clothes for work tomorrow. The socks are in the drier, the shoes are in their place.
At dinner, I've made your favorite food. Shami Kebab.
Thank you.
I've inserted mother with insulin.
The night dress is ready as well. You have to take care of the kids as well.
You're the one who takes best care of them. But I'll be able to manage.
When are you coming back?
Sunday...
That means that I'll have to stay awake till Sunday.
Why would you? You have the kids...
You have to be with the kids. You know they feel afraid alone.
Don't worry... I'll manage everything. Now go.
Miss me.
Why?
When you leave, there will be someone else in your place..
I'll kill her.
You know that no one can take your place.
Meet mother before you leave... you're running late for your flight.
Whilst playing sister Farheen hurt her foot and she started crying...
Mother heard her...
You pushed her right?
I didn't.
I can see that... keep this to the side.
Mother... I'm going to Islamabad.
Yes go... who can stop you.
Don't worry about here, Arhum will take care of the kids and the home.
Go... and you've been free from my responsibility a long time ago. Go and have fun.
Mother, she's going because of an important meeting.
What did I say?
Everyone has their priorities. To some people family is the most important thing...
for other it's their future.
It's all about making the right decision at the right time.
Right?
Alright mother, we'll get going.
Farewell. May God protect you.
Call Fabiha... where is she? Why isn't she here yet?
Find out where she is... what's the matter mother?
Why are you always worried about her?
You don't care about my job or anything else... you're always concerned about Fabiha.
I've gotten a job... I'm not dependent on anyone else.
May God have mercy. She takes two buses to come back home.
I'm so worried until she comes home.
Then make her stay home. Why do you allow her to leave?
She runs the entire house. The one who I didn't allow to leave..
it's not like she cared about our respect.
In the end all your anger strikes down on me.
Call her... I don't have the credit, otherwise I would have.
Where's my phone?
Ask her.
Mother, she's not picking up and why are you pacing... your blood pressure will rise.
It's late, she should be home by now.
Even if she does, it's not like she'll tell you the truth. I know she'll make excuses.
That there was traffic... auntie got sick, or something with the kids.
But she will not tell you the truth.
What do you mean?
I had forgotten that Fabiha always tells the truth.
I'm the only liar her. She's the master of her fate.
And I don't have that luck.
What I says goes around here.
She works from 9 in the morning till 6 in the evening.
It's late, she should be home by now. Fabiha knows this.
Mother... I think that it's important for you to remind her.
This freedom isn't good. You won't be able to do anything...
if something bad happens.
Where were you?
I was washing the kids' clothes.
Why? Why were you washing it? The maid comes home for that.
Miss Shenaya asked me, so I couldn't refuse.
She pays me, hence I'm bound to do some work.
She's the owner of this house.
I've noticed that Arhum doesn't ignore anything she says.
That's the pride I have to break.
Forget that, did you have something for me?
Yes, open my closet and keep this.
Why? I just made you change.
Open up... there is a red box, right next to the clothes, bring it.
Yes, that one... give it to me.
Sit down.
These are my favorite earrings.
Arhum's father bought it for me. I've worn it a lot of times, but not anymore I'm afraid.
I want  to give you this.
No auntie, I can't take it. Miss Shenaya will be angry if she finds out
Here you go... I'm happy to give it to you. No one deserves an opinion.
No need to worry.
These are ordinary.
But my desires and dreams are much bigger.
Only Arhum can fulfill those.
