You have compromised with your fate.
Just pray that your children do it too.
What it is about kids, mom? They'll forget everything in one night.
They'll forget everything when they see a little kid laughing and playing.
They won't remember anything. 
My dear, don't forget yourself while making these sacrifices. 
 Don't worry about me, mom. I'll handle myself.
And someone who has her mother's prayers with her. How won't she be happy?
I cannot see you in any more pain, Sanaya.
Come on, you come with us. 
 No mom.
I will not go anywhere. I've thought things through before I made this decision.
If I leave today, my children will be scattered. I'll not go anywhere.
Sorry, mom..
Arham.. being angry won't solve anything. 
 The kids, for whose future, I have been struggling day and night..
Sanaya feels I'm not serious about their future.
Thats why I am the one to be blamed.
And is marrying for the second time, is it such a big sin? Am I responsible for everything?
Do you think I don't care about my children or don't I love them? 
 Its neither yours nor Hadi's fault.
It is only Sanaya's fault. She is responsible for everything. And Hadi is just a kid. He'll learn whatever he's taught.
I accept whatever happened was wrong but you should know why it happened.
I don't know Fabiha. 
 I do. I know everything. Sanaya is doing everything.
If there had been any other kid in place of Hadi, he'd have done the same.
What is Sanaya doing? 
 Sanaya is pressurizing kids to stay away from you, because of me. Thats the truth, Arham.
Hadi told me himself that she's very strict with him. The kid will be scared Arham.
You have no idea how scared he is.
Fabiha, she is their mother, why would she do this? 
 Because of me. Why else? She's very hurt because you married me.
And now she want to hurt you and drive the kids away from you.
Hadi and Hareem are being negatively affected by everything, Arham. This is why they're misbehaving more and more everyday.
They aren't getting any affection from their mother and they're losing their father as well. The kids are bound to do this.
You'll have to think yourself about them.
Do you have to discuss something else with me, other than Farheen? When I told you to leave one, leave. Don't you understand?
Go!
What is this? Will you not have it? 
 No. And even if I want it, I'll have it in my room.
I won't disturb your privacy. 
 Sit here. I'm asking you to sit Hania.
Sit down.. I'm sorry.
I was very  rude with you. 
 You always do this. It isn't something new.
I'm telling you I'm sorry. I was worried about work.
And you know very well, it wasn't about office. I'm sure Farheen must have said something to you.
Otherwise why would she call me and ask about you? 
 You've become way clever living with Farheen. 
Think about it as so because respectable people cannot survive in this society.
Thats why I tell you to not be so respectable. 
 So you want me to become a goon?
Not a goon but at least become someone's reason to live.
Oh well.. there's no use to make you understand. Farheen is right. 
 And what is she right about?
God save the girl who comes in your life.
You have started talking way too much. Go and start making arrangements for tonight. Sit, I'll go and see.
Hello aunty. Come inside please. 
 I have a lot of complaints. I came myself or else you wouldn't have called me.
No. Its not that. I was so busy working, it skipped my mind. 
 Of course it would skip your mind. See,
you said it wasn't like this but it is so. 
 Please come and sit. Hania, aunty and Farheen are here. Come and bring some refreshments.
The good news is that you still came even if you were upset with me and I'm indebted to you.
I'll make it up to you, soon. 
 Its not like this, dear.
Hello. How are you? Thank God you're here. I was waiting for you. Please come. 
Where? 
 I need your help to choose a dress.
Who is the boy? What does he do? 
 He has an import export business, aunty.
He supplies things made of crystal. 
 Don't worry. I'll handle the guests.
Its good that you came otherwise all this would have been difficult for me. 
 How could I not come?
Hania is like Farheen.. just like my daughter. 
 Yes, it is so.
You see if there is something missing or if we need anything else. I'll go and get it right away.
I'll go and ask Hania if something is missing. Then I'll tell you. 
 Alright.
See, what I brought for my Hadi. Your favorite sandwich. 
 No. I don't want it.
Why? You were hungry. 
 Mom told me not to.
But mom isn't home right now, you can eat it. 
 We shouldn't do anything secretly from mom.
I'm telling you.. dad will talk to mom.. you can eat. 
 No. I won't eat or else mom will hit me.
Mom warned us that we have to eat the curry and flat breads.
Come on Hadi, lets eat.
Sanaya is being harsh with the kids. She's dragging them in between without any reason. Whats their fault?
The children are scared even when Sanaya isn't present. This isn't happening. Sanaya is the limit.
Did you see with your eyes how scared Hadi was?
He didn't eat his favorite sandwich.
Think about it.. if a mother doesn't care about what her children like or dislike. Will she take time to take them away from their father?
I'm not a mother but seeing all this pains me, Arham.
If this keeps on, it won't be long before the children are away from you.
Hareem is growing up and she understands the good and bad. This is why Sanaya only pressurizes Hadi.
He is a kid and he is scared. Looking at Hadi, even Hareem is being affected.
Sanaya has thought everything through before planning all this. 
 Fabiha I don't understand what to do.
Should I give you an advice? 
 What advice?
You should overtake Hadi's responsibility yourself.
If you don't want his mind to be negatively affected, keep him with you.
What happened? 
 Nothing.
Now write it down and show me. Very nice.
Which paper have you prepared for now? 
 Math.
Very good. Very good. 
 Dad are you upset with me?
No dear. Dad isn't upset with you. 
 Dad, I'm sorry. You had to face insult because of me in the school.
But what could I do? I didn't like when someone sad bad things about my father.
I know. Dad isn't upset with you. Don't think like this. You'll sleep with dad from today. 
 Yaay..
Lets go. My dear.. 
 Where are you taking Hadi?
Hadi will sleep with me today. 
 Hadi has always slept with me.
Why did you think of taking Hadi along, all of a sudden? 
 Sanaya, I'm their father.
I'll take him whenever I want to. I have this right. 
 You're passionately aware about being their father today.
You couldn't see anything else other than Fabiha earlier. 
 This.. this is the trash in your mind that you're polluting the kids with.
Sanaya please don't do this. They're very innocent. 
 And what do I want?
Hadi will not stay with you, Sanaya.
You are distancing the children from me because you're angry. 
 I know very well whose teaching you all this Arham.
You snatched yourself away from me and now you want to take away my kids?
So whats wrong in this? Its not wrong at all.
You're polluting their mind. Accept it. 
 Arham, why would I pollute the mind of my own kids?
She is only saying this to turn you against me. Nothing else.
Remember this.. you'll regret it. 
 Sanaya, only time will tell whose right and whose wrong.
Hadi will sleep with me and thats final. I don't want any more arguments.
Hareem, do your homework. Come on Hadi.
Hadi, you're here. 
 Fabiha aunty I'll sleep with you today.
Why will you sleep here? 
 Because dad said I'll sleep with you.
Fabiha, will you take care of me and play games with me?
Tell me Fabiha aunty. Tell me..
Fabiha aunty tell me.. 
 Hadi, be quiet and sleep!
Hamza? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
Thanks.. you take Hania as your own.
Hania has no connection with whatever happened.
But Hamza if you didn't like what I said, you could have been angry. Running away or hiding has no use.
See, talking will solve problems and giving space increases love.
If you're angry, you should express. And if you love someone, you should tell them.
Farheen, you shouldn't have said that about dying for Fabiha. 
 I was right.
And thats why you didn't like it. You couldn't digest the truth.
Its not like that. 
 Alright. Whatever it is. I'm here because of Hania.
No matter how you break our trust, I promised Hania and I cannot let her down.
How do you think the boy is? 
 This is in your hand. Why are you asking me?
As it is, my opinion doesn't matter to you. You think I'm Fabiha? 
 You can advise me as a friend.
He's good but ask Hania once.
Hmm.. 
 And listen Hamza.. don't mention our argument to Hania. She's already worried about you.
Don't worry.
What happened? 
 I was just looking at the tray.
What is it? Did you have an argument with Hamza?
No. No mom.. Nothing.
Here's your fresh juice. Finish it fast. 
 I understand whatever you're doing.
Don't think you can take away my kids doing all this. 
 You're mistaken if you think the kids will stay with you.
The kids will stay where they get love.
And do you remember, you told me you had nothing to lose? The day isn't far when you'll lose the kids too.
Of course, if you leave the kids will leave with you.
And if the kids leave with you, Arham will be worried and if Arham is worried, my happiness will be affected.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Thats why its important that kids know that you're not responsible for them. They want their freedom and they'll get it with me.
And of course, when you go to work, I'll handle the kids. But this activity will go on for a few weeks only.
I already have the husband. The kids will soon be mine as well.
I'm not scared anymore.
I made the juice myself.
Farheen? How much will you make Hamza wait for? 
 Mom, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Hurry up. What have you thought about the proposal Hamza?
I was thinking to discuss with you once. Did you like the boy?
I really liked him. You're mature enough now. 
 Even I liked the boy. Should I say yes?
Of course. If you like him, why should you hesitate? Go ahead. 
 Had mom been here on this occassion..
Hamza.. dear when mothers leave this world..
even then, they don't forget their children. They pray on the skies.
Aunty.. have you not been able to forget Fabiha, yet.. 
 The person who wounds you..
its very difficult to forget them. Even if its your children. 
 Will you forgive Fabiha if I forgive her?
Hamza.. what are you made of?
You'll forgive the person who killed you?
Mom used to say the person who forgives is better than the one who hurt you.
I've forgiven her.
You should also forgive her and allow her to come here.
Farheen? 
 Yes mom. I'm here. Tea.
Farheen, get ready fast. We'll leave then. 
 Just five more minutes.
Please take something.
Arham.. I was thinking since Hareem sleeps with Sanaya and Hadi sleeps with us, why don't we set up the kids room for our baby?
He'll adjust with Hadi and Hareem too. 
 If you want, we'll decorate another room for our child.
I wanted that. If we can set up the kid's room for our baby and shift the children to another room. What do you think?
Alright. This isn't a bad idea. I'll talk to Mr. Amir. You decide how to renovate. Everything will be done.
Thank you Arham.
Ask Sanaya once.
What if she minds? 
 Why should I ask Sanaya? Why would she mind?
Arham, they are her kids. If we change without asking her, she'll mind. 
 They are not only her kids, but mine as well.
And you shouldn't worry about Sanaya. I'm here. I'll handle everything. 
 Thank you.
You think, forgiving Fabiha will allow you to throw her out of your heart and mind? 
 I'm trying that.
Maybe I can forget her. 
 God knows if this is possible for you.
Leave everything and tell me, I'm thinking to finalize a date for Hania next month.
What do you think about it? 
 Its great news.
She will get married very soon. 
 Alright then. Start preparing for the wedding.
