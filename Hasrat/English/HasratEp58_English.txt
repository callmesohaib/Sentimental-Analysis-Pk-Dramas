After Haris left...
if there was someone who was there for me, then that was you.
And I started liking you. I started realizing your pain, even more than you.
I thought that I...
I could replace Fabiha for you.
This is not the time to fight Arhum.
Where are my kids? Find them! Where are they!
They are my kids as well. I'll find them.
I made you responsible, why did you ask her?
Hareem was your responsibility...
I want my kids...
Did you ask the school?
I did, but they don't know.
We need to file a report with the police.
Yes, you're right. I should head to the police station.
This happened and you didn't even tell me.
What are you talking about?
That sister Farheen wants to marry you.
And I know you that much... you only refused because you're afraid of Fabiha.
Right?
Was she afraid of being disloyal to you.
Then why are you afraid of her whilst taking the biggest decision of your life.
To tell you the truth I do not object sister Farheen.
Hania, I don't want to talk about this.
Why not? I want to know.
I told you that I don't want to talk about it, don't be stubborn.
Alright fine, don't worry sister Farheen if you don't want to.
Marry my friend's sister then.
So that I may be at peace that my brother has forgotten Fabiha.
If you want to marry someone then why not sister Farheen?
One should choose a path where he is certain of his companion.
Someone who will not betray you or left you stranded, like Fabiha did.
It's foolish to run after her. Something that you've been doing up till now.
Sister Farheen wants to take care of someone who can't even take care of himself.
Sister Farheen was right when she said that you have to decided who you will put in sister Farheen's place.
Is it sister Farheen or someone else?
Where are the kids Arhum?
Where are the kids Arhum?
I couldn't find the kids.
You couldn't find them?
You promised me that you would bring the kids home.
I just talked to the inspector, he assured me that he will find the kids till morning.
What will we do until then? Shall we do nothing? I wonder how my kids must be... I wonder if they ate something.
Pray that both of them are together, don't worry. We'll find them soon.
We're trying... what can we do sitting at home?
Shall we wait for the kids....
Sister my kids...
I want my kids...
Junaid said that we would find them. Don't worry.
Shenaya, don't lose strength...
How can I not lose strength? I want my kids.... where are they? I'll die if I don't find my kids.
I'm trying...
All of this happened because of her...
What are you doing?
Ever since she's come in my life she has ruined it! First she stole my husband and now my kids!
I might have compromised on my husband, but if something happens to my kids...
then I will kill you!
Your kids were your responsibility...not mine!
Shut up!
Fabiha...
What?
If I took care of the kids it was because I loved you.
The kids were her mother's responsibility, not mine!
This is what should happen to women like you. She couldn't take care of her husband and her kids!
I didn't expect this from you.
If you had picked the kids up on time, they would have been here right now.
Go upstairs!
Go!
I don't know... Arhum find my kids... I can't live without them.
Trust me..
I'm trying.
Brother, do something
Yes... inspector...
Yes, I'll be right over...
What did he say?
He's called me over...
Listen to me...
We need to paste some folders around the city. I'll make some social media posts as well. I'll mention it in my groups as well.
Alright? Come with me...
Let's go... sister please take care of her.
I'll come with you...
Shenaya stay here with me...
Farheen... the tea has been boiling for a while now... are you in your senses?
Mother, it's not boiling... you told me that you liked cooked tea.
I did say that, but that doesn't mean I like burnt tea.
Forget about that... tell me...
Did you visit Hamza? What did Hania say?
Nothing mother, she called me because she wanted to pack some stuff.
She wanted to go to the market for some clothes.
Did you meet Hamza?
No... I did not.
I feel as though...
he didn't take what you said seriously...
I was thinking of calling him here and apologizing.
What if we lose our relationship in all this.
Whatever you think is right.
Farheen...
Mother.
Why does this always happen to me?
Why am I always deprived of happiness? Why am I being tested so much?
I'm tired mother...
God willing everything will be better.
Pray to God... don't cry.
How are you?
I'm well my dear.
Is everything alright? Why are you guys here?
Can't we come here without a reason?
No my dear... I didn't mean it that way.
Now that you're here, eat before you leave.
To tell you the truth, you'll have to be our host. After all we are from the family of the groom.
What do you mean?
What do you think? What if we marry my brother to sister Farheen?
Huh? What is she saying Hamza?
Hania is right. I want to marry Farheen..
if you don't have any objections.
We'll do it this week and there is no option for you to refuse.
It was hard for me to convince my brother, and you are now indebted to me.
Hania... has Hamza really agreed?
Yes he has!
I can't believe it!
You two are getting married this week.
Just don't go insane.
I think I really will go insane.
What can I do?
You have to take care of my brother.
Sit down, I'll bring tea.
I'm very tired sister... I can't walk anymore.
You remember what the uncle said, just a little further.
Sister I'm starving.
We can only eat once we reach there.
Nothing is present here to eat.
I have a sandwich in my bag, sit here.
I'll give it to you right away.
Here is your sandwich.
Here you are.
Hurry up...
Do you want some sister?
No Hadi, I'm stuffed.
Hurry up, we have to leave as well. Come on eat...
I'm stuffed... keep this inside, let's go.
Alright fine... let me close this.
This is not closing.
It's closed... let's go now.
Come on.
We've set the wedding date, but got nothing sweet.
The groom's family are the ones who bring the sweetmeats...
I know, but we were so happy that we forgot.
It's alright, I'll bring some once I'm done eating.
That's great.
Sister, let's go home... I'm very tired...
Think about it... you'll have to live with father, and I'll have to live with mother...
At least at an orphanage we can live together...
Shall we go there then?
That's what I've been saying.
I trusted you by marrying you, I relied on you.
Curse the time when I decided to marry you.
You think we lost Hadi because of you.
If you had picked him up from school on time, he'd be with us today.
It's not like Shenaya reached the school on time.
It's her own kids and she didn't care, then why should I?
They were my kids as well... you could have cared....
I trusted you by marrying you, I relied on you.
Curse the time when I decided to marry you.
Great going!
I was the destroyed your home... I was the one who lost your kids...
I was the one who distanced you from Shenaya. I was the one who stole the rights of your children. What about what Shenaya did to you?
A few days ago you blamed Shenaya for everything and now you're standing by her.
A woman is to blame for everything. A women is always wrong.
It's very easy to hand over the responsibilities to a woman and then blame her for the shortcomings.
But tell me one thing... if a man marries for the second, then so does the woman... it is with the same desire...
Still why does the man act so dumb? Answer me!
A man tolerates everything to defend his second marriage.
But when it comes to the shortcoming, he blames the woman. Answer me why?
You blamed me for everything.
It's not like you did anything wrong. You have no fault in this.
You're right.
It's not your fault, it's mine.
Mine.
I realize it now.
Arhum.
What did you do?
Junaid has gone to the inspector...
Hope for the best.
How will I live without my children?
I'll die... how will I live without the kids?
I learned to live without Arhum, what will I do without the kids?
Don't worry Shenaya, we'll find the kids.
Junaid and brother Arhum are at it... we'll find the kids.
Pray for them... a mother's prayer are immediately accepted.
Pray for them...
Happiness has been stripped away from me.
Ever since Fabiha stepped inside this house... I've been tolerating everything.
I have strangled my right, but how can I strangle my motherhood?
Hope for the best... God protect my kids.
I wonder where my kids must be.
What should I do?
Hadi... Hadi... Hadi...
Sister, are you okay?
No, I'm completely fine.
Where is your home?
Who are you two with?
Get out of our way... let us go...
I should let you go?
Where do you want to go?
We want to go to an orphanage... could you take us?
Sure, I can take you there.
I know where to go...
Let's go with him.
You don't know the way... let's go with him!
Enough! I've been with you since morning!
I can take you there... did you eat?
Let us go... we've eaten...
Get out of our way...
I'll give you chocolates... I'll take you to your parents as well.
So what if Hadi isn't here.... I'll play with you
I want to play with father and Hadi...
I want father to feed me.
Like uncle was feeding Anayah.
Mother, I'm father's princess, right?
So what if father isn't here. I'll feed you
I don't want to mother.
I want to be fed by you and father!
What happened? Why are you crying?
I'm thinking of how long I'll have to be away from you.
Why are you so afraid, are you hiding something from me?
No... 
Don't hide anything from me... tell me what happened.
I didn't play any video game yesterday, still auntie Fabiha complained to father...
Father went to work and...
he scolded me and asked me to leave the house.
How long will you turn the kids against me? Why don't you take them away and be end my problems.
I understand everything. You send them here, so that Arhum makes my life hell.
Your kids are being crushed by your jealousy.
I don't them to revolt, so stop using them against me.
In all of this...
the kids got neglected, and we completely ignored it.
When your feelings are buried...
then it makes no difference what happens.
I told you that this would have a bad effect on the kids.
But you just wanted to pursue your happiness.
All you wanted to be is happy.
No matter the cost.
I tried...
I tried to fix everything... but...
everything got ruined.
You came...
I tried to make you understand.
I tried.... I asked you to control your emotions.
Your emotional haste will destroy us.
You couldn't control your emotions, and you couldn't be a good father.
Can't everything return to how it was?
Like stale water can't be used...
like that... a buried person cannot be brought back.
I just want my kids..
And nothing else?
There's nothing left.
Yes inspector...
What?
You've found the kids?
We've found the kids... a man brought them to the police station.
Sir... there's a problem
We've found the kids, but they don't want to come home.
What do you mean?
There's a misunderstanding, I'll be right there.
Hurry up, I think there's something wrong.
What are you saying?
I want to come with you as well.
You can't go... I'll bring the kids back... what if they don't come with you.
I promise, I'll bring them back... they are my kids as well.
Don't worry.
