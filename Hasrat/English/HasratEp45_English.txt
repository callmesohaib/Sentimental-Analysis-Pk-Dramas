Today is the last day of school. Revise well for your exams. Whatever your teacher explains you,
mom will you ask about it. 
 Okay mom. 
Good boy. Hareem you too.
Come on now. 
 Mom, how have you made me wear this?
Sorry.. now hurry up. The van is about to come.
Go and change. I'll make the juice. 
 You'll do it?
You took care of me all night and did me a favor. I can at least try and pay you back with this small thing.
Sanaya, whatever I did wasn't a favor. Its my duty. 
 All your duties seem like a loan to me now, Arham.
How will we spend our life like this Sanaya?
Life goes by..
Living is difficult, Arham.
So what do we have for breakfast? Hello mom. How are you? 
 Hello.
Mom? 
 What is it mom? You seem worried. Is everything okay?
Tell me the truth. What are you hiding from me? 
 What will we hide mom?
I heard the two of you last night.
Thats why tell me the truth, Soumya.
I don't have it in my fate to see my daughter happy,
but don't hide her pain from me. Tell me what happened?
Mom.. actually, Arham was in the hospital with Fabiha, yesterday.
And Fabiha is expecting.
What? You hid such a big thing from me?
Mom.. we didn't want to give you any tensions thats why we didn't tell you.
My daughter must be crying tears of blood and you're worried about my happiness?
Mom, this had to happen. 
 Does Sanaya know about it?
I didn't talk to Sanaya about it. 
 She didn't even mention this to me either.
Mom, let it be. Don't worry. God will make everything alright. Please have this juice. 
Junaid see.. go and bring Sanaya and her kids here for a few days.
I know how difficult this time is for her.
Bring them here tomorrow. 
 Okay, I'll bring them tomorrow. We'll do as you say.
Now please have your breakfast. Do you want some bread? 
 I'll take it dear. I'm feeling very anxious.
Wow.. you had your husband for one night and you've changed. As if you have all the rights.
I don't run after things that are snatched from me.
Its good. You shouldn't even run. 
 Drink your juice or it'll get warm. 
Thank you. 
 And yes..
Be careful. Its not your husband but his first wife who made this juice for you.
I've lost everything. Be careful.. you don't want to lose everything too.
What nonsense is this? What did you mix in this? 
 I didn't mix anything. I was trying to scare you and you got scared.
How did the glass fall down? 
 Arham, she told me she mixed something in the juice.
And you threw the glass?
Its okay Arham. This happens with women in this condition. 
 I'm fine Arham. I'm not lying. She told me she mixed something in the juice.
I'll order something for you. Please don't clear it. I'll get it cleared.
Sanaya thinks, she'll do all this to drive Arham away from me. I'll clear her misunderstanding now.
Hello. 
 Hello. You're back soon.
Yes. I wasn't feeling well. 
 Why have you started feeling unwell lately?
Mom please.. don't act like my mother in law now. 
 What?
Where is Hamza? 
 He hasn't forgotten Fabiha yet.
If you can, please rid him of it. 
 Tell me clearly.
I don't know what Fabiha has that Hamza cannot see in me. Maybe he ignores me deliberately.
Why don't you tell me what it is? I don't understand whatever you're doing.
Did you have a fight with Hamza? 
 Oh mom.. its work stress. What should I tell you?
You have started taking this work stress right now. There was nothing earlier.
I have a headache right now. Please don't start with your questions now.
What? 
Whats wrong? Why are you so restless? 
 I'll be restless if I see you worried.
And if there are so many problems in your office, quit it. Find another place.
I'll leave it when I find a good job. 
 I think you've gone mad.
And the way you misbehave with me, I am the only one who tolerates it. Nobody else will.
I shouldn't have talked to Hamza like this. He must be so angry. What will he think about me? I don't understand what to do.
Good to see you around. 
 Same here. Rahat Group of Companies haven't sent a confirmation email.
You're very lucky. Your job is saved. The CEO of Shah Group of Companies was here. He wants to open his account worth millions here.
He praised you so much in front of the boss. Now you know.. 
 My promotion will be finalized.
Of course, my dear. 
 Sorry. Just pray my friend.
Abdullah told me your father has married twice. Do you have two moms?
No. My father didn't marry anyone. Abdullah is lying. 
 Abdullah is making fun of your father with his friends.
I will not spare Abdullah. I'll go teach him a lesson. Abdullah!
What did you say? 
 Hadi is here..
Which mother dropped you today? Your own mother or your step mother? 
 I'll tell you which mother I came with.
Hello Farheen. How are you? 
 Hello. I'm absolutely fine. 
How come you called me today? 
 I hadn't talked to you since so many days so I thought  I'd called you.
So Hania.. is Hamza alright? 
 Brother? Didn't you meet him? Didn't you not go to work?
No. Is he back home? 
 What happened Farheen? Its 1pm in the afternoon. He wouldn't come at this hour.
Oh.. he's home.
Farheen has called. She wants to talk to you.
Farheen? I think Hamza is tired. He didn't even listen to me and went inside.
Maybe something happened.
You wait. I'll try and find out and I'll tell you if I find out. Okay?
Alright. Bye. 
 Okay. 
So many missed calls from Hadi's school? Hello? Hello?
What? What are you saying? Okay. I'm coming. 
Arham, Hadi's school called. Hadi threw a stone at Mrs. Hassan's son. Her son is bleeding. I'm going to the school. Please come fast.
Hadi.. what did you do dear? 
 Abdullah said that my dad had married twice.
So? Would you do this?
Hadi.. what did you do dear? 
 Abdullah said that my dad had married twice.
So? Would you do this?
Hadi.. what did you do? Mom told you not to. 
 Abdullah was saying bad things about my dad..
The kids around the school are discussing Mr. Arham's second marriage.
This had to happen. When Hadi was made fun of, he threw a rock at Abdullah's head and split it open.
Mam, this is our personal matter. If the children discuss their home matters in the school, I think its a teacher's duty to discipline them.
Mr. Arham, if this was your personal matter you should have told your children at home, not to spoil the discipline here.
Hadi's actions are intolerable. I will only allow him for his exams now.
You can find him a new school when the new session starts.
Mam, how can you do this? This cannot happen. Where will my son go?
Her son threw a rock at Abdullah today. God knows what he'll do tomorrow.
I cannot take any risk for my son. Either Hadi will stay in this school..
Or, my Fatima, Narmeen and Abdullah will not study here.
No. Mrs. Hassan, don't worry. Its Hadi's fault. I cannot destroy the future of three kids for him.
Sorry Mrs. Sanaya. I cannot allow your son.
Its about Hadi's future. You cannot do this to my son. Please mam. 
See, Mrs. Sanaya, if I allow your son, tomorrow some other parents will stand in your place.
This has never happened in our school before so I cannot allow your children.
See, there is a procedure within a school. If there is a complain, you cannot expel him straightforwardly.
There is a warning. There must be a warning.  
 Sir, I had already warned Mrs. Sanaya.
That your children were very depressed. Please you need to focus on them.
Sanaya.. you didn't tell me. 
 See, if Mrs. Hassan accepts your apology. We'll reconsider the admission.
Brother...
What happened? 
 Farheen called. She wants to discuss something important. 
I don't want to talk to anyone right now.
Brother, whats wrong? She wants to discuss the guests. 
 I told you I don't want to talk to anyone. 
Whats wrong brother? 
 Do you have anything else to discuss with me other than Farheen?
Now tell me what happened? Why are you so pissed off? 
 Hania, I have a lot of work related stress. Please go.
Right now I think its more about Farheen than your office.
I'm telling you to go. 
 No. I won't. First tell me what happened? 
I'm telling you to leave, leave! Why don't you understand once?!
Go!
Hania...
Who fights in the school, Hadi?
Why did you hit Abdullah?
Do you know, dad was so embarrassed in front of your principal because of you?
Dad, everybody was laughing at me and saying that my dad has married twice.
And I have two moms.
If the principal had warned you, you could have told me Sanaya. 
 When did you have the time?
Sanaya.. you forget things. Don't make it my fault.
Please, accept that its your fault.
Don't scream, Arham.
And if you had worried about what I wanted, the structure of this house would have been different. As far as telling you is concerned, I did come to you.
But you were so busy in your so called life that you didn't worry about the children.
Are the kids only mine?
Is it my responsible to report about the kids? 
 Don't talk about responsibilities, Sanaya!
Why shouldn't I talk about rights? You have my rights to someone else and wronged me and my children!
Whatever Hadi's condition is today, its only because of you Arham.
Sanaya, this isn't because of my wrong decision but because of your irresponsibility!
Really? If you think that is so, you take the responsibility of the kids, then.
You think if I cannot handle the responsibility of my own kids, then go ahead and you do it.
This is easier said than done, Arham.
Really? This means, I cannot fulfill the responsibility of my own kids?
Sanaya.. you cannot accuse me for Hadi's mistake.
You are responsible as well.
And what do you think? Apologizing would fix everything? You and I will have to apologize to Mrs. Hassan and then his admission will be reconsidered.
Now why are you looking at me?
Arham, stop it. Why are you fighting in front of the kid? 
 I'm warning you. Stay out of it.
I was just.. 
 I told you..
Stay away from me and my kids. 
 Sanaya!
She is as much a part of this family as you are.
You cannot insult her in front of me.. Remember this.
She can be a part of your life but not this house because there are other people here, Arham.
And I will not even let her shadow fall on my kids.
Mom...
Did Hamza call, mom?
No. What happened?
He was telling me that some people wanted to come see Hania.
But he didn't know how to handle everything so he wanted us to be there.
This is a great news. When did they call us? 
 Tonight.
He said the boy was well settled.
He has his own house and business.
He said that the boy must keep Hania happy.
Its good. Hania will get married. May God bless her with a good life.
Hamza's friend, who is always with him. He's his cousin.
Alright. I pray to God for Hania's good fortune.
May she live happily in her house.
Both my daughters had an ill fate.
We'll leave at 6pm.
You get ready. I'll call a cab.
Alright.
It seems you have been scolded a lot by your father.
Will you not talk to me too? I was thinking to make a sandwich. Do you want one? 
 No.
Oh.. so much anger?
See your dad is right. You shouldn't fight in your school.
If you want, I'll make your dad talk to you. 
 Really?
Of course. He'll agree if I tell him.
What is all this Sanaya? You said everything was alright? Arham was fine with you. Everything was okay.
What is all this?
He was screaming at you.
Hadi threw a stone at a child in the school and its my fault.
He has been expelled from his school and this is my fault too.
I thought about the kids' future and its my fault too, mom. 
If you are scolded like me, then? 
 Then both of us will be upset with dad and hide in the garden and he'll come find us.
But then you'll have to be okay. You'll have to be friends with dad. Done? 
 Done.
Now stop being upset. Lets go. 
 Alright.
Come..
But whats wrong is wrong, dear.
Hadi shouldn't have done it. What happened?
Hadi's parents are wrong, mom. Hadi isn't.
But Arham won't understand this. Maybe nobody will.
You tell me.. even if dad isn't alive today, if someone says something to him, how will we tolerate it?
Who will hear bad for their father, dear? 
 How could Hadi, then, mom?
If the kids will say something bad about his dad in the school, how will he tolerate?
If you tell us something as your family, only then we'll know.
You told me to settle down.
And if I have to settle down, I shouldn't complain, mom.
I have to forget everything and move on and I'm trying that.
I told you to settle down, dear. But this doesn't mean you'll not share your pain with your mother.
And you start hiding things from your mother.
What did I hide from you? 
 Things you should've told me yourself, Sanaya. I'm finding out from Soumya.
Why have you started hiding everything from your mother?
I accept that you have a lot of courage and you want to tolerate everything yourself without sharing your pain with your mother.
But dear, sharing pain makes it less but if you tolerate it all alone, you'll become helpless.
Why be helpless mom? I have to be happy for my kids.
I had heard from my mother that nobody has courage like a mother.
But I've seen it in my daughter's face today.
You have compromised with your fate.. Just pray that your kids do it too.
What is it about kids mom? They will forget everything in one night.
