You seem tired. Was there a lot of work? 
 Yes we have an assignment deadline. Its the workload.
You must be thinking that ever since you came, we've been having problems and worries.
And you didn't get anything you deserved. 
 What is it about me, Arham?
I was living with desires earlier and I'll do that now as well. I just don't want you worried. 
 Fabiha, I promise I'll fulfill all your wishes.
For me, you are important, not my desires. 
 I had all my hopes pinned on Sanaya but she didn't support me.
You have made a place for yourself in this house and in my heart by supporting me in this bad time. But maybe even you,
might be thinking I'm nothing without Sanaya. 
 Its not like that Arham. This self depreciation is instilled in you by Sanaya.
And you're thinking you're weak by believing it. If a woman earns more, she makes her man, weak.
But you're not weak. Believe in your power and use it. 
 I'll never be weak if you're with me.
I'm with you and I'll always be with you.
Did you talk to Sanaya about the plot? 
 I'll do it today. Can you make me a cup of coffee? I'm too tired. I'll go change.
I'll go make it.
Hello mom. What happened? Aren't you ready? We have to go to Sanaya's house. 
 I'm not feeling well.
I feel my blood pressure is high. When we checked, it was 190/110. I have high palpitations as well.
Your blood pressure is very high. Lets go to the doctor first. 
 I'll be fine. I've just taken the medicine.
You're worried about Sanaya. Thats the problem. 
 Sanaya isn't happy Junaid. 
Did you talk to her? 
 I called to ask about the kids. I feel she's upset with me and thats what I cannot withstand.
She thinks we're not with her. You should go and bring her here for a few days. She'll feel we're all with her then.
Of course, we're with her. What are you saying? But if she's trying to adjust in her house, we cannot hold her back.
Her husband has married somebody else. She'll be worried and upset and she'll express her disdain as well. But you shouldn't take everything to heart.
See we have to handle Sanaya's problem. If you get worried like this, how will we handle it?
Hmm.. 
 Mom relax. I'll call her and talk to her. Everything will be alright.
What are you doing? Arham what are you looking for? Tell me what you're looking for?
Arham, why don't you tell me, what do you want? 
 Sanaya, where is the file for the plot?
You're forgetting that we bought the plot for Hareem. 
 I remember everything. Don't remind me. Tell me where is the file.
You cannot sell that plot. 
 Where is the file of the plot? Please.
Tell me. 
 The file isn't here. 
Where is it? 
 Its with brother Junaid. 
Tell your brother, I want that file by tonight. Ask him to bring it. 
 Its not only your plot.
Wow. This is what you mean. 
 Arham, I didn't mean that. 
I know what you mean. Don't say no. Fabiha is right. You kept the plot, the house for bad times.
Isn't it? Sanaya.. after looking at everything, I'm not at all upset about being disloyal to you. You deserved all this.
A woman like you deserved all this. I lost my mother because of you, Sanaya.
I'll not let Fabiha go.
And another thing, if I sell this plot, I'll give you your share. And keep it safe. You'll need it.
What happened? Did you get the file? 
 No. Its not at home. Its with Sanaya's brother.
But don't worry, I told her I need it by tonight. 
 If it belongs to the two of you, why is it with Sanaya's brother?
This shows that she never trusted you.
Otherwise, why would someone keep their property with someone else?
Aunty kept telling me that Sanaya didn't trust her thats why she left her kids with her mother and then portrayed her to be the bad guy.
Aunty told me that Sanaya didn't care for her and I never believed her. But aunty was absolutely right.
Sanaya didn't you give tea to mom? How could you forget it? 
 I went Arham. Mom said she wanted to sleep so what could I do?
Where? When did you come, dear? I didn't know.
Take me to the bathroom. Your wife has said no, clearly. 
 Mom, I just brought you out of the bathroom.
She's lying. You change your colors like a chameleon once you see your husband.
You want to tell me that its my fault, mom is paralyzed. 
 Yes, if you had given the insulin on time..
My mother would have been on her feet. She wouldn't be on the bed.
Before you accused me of something so big, at least think about it. I didn't..
 Accept it if you made a mistake.
She was right. Aunty never got her insulin.
Now see for yourself. Aunty was right objecting her job. Its all her benefit.
What can you expect from such a selfish woman?
Junaid, I've given mom food and medicine.
What is this? 
 This is Sanaya's plot file. I'm going to give it back to her. 
But why? It is on Hareem's name. 
 Whatever it is, it is hers. I'll have to return when she asks for it.
Sanaya didn't ask for it. It must be Arham's doing.
Whenever he is in trouble, he remembers this plot. Don't you remember how Sanaya stopped him the last time he wanted to sell this plot?
Sanaya kept this file here so that they wouldn't sell it because it won't be there.
God knows, what Arham wants.. 
 Whatever it is.. It is their personal matter. What can we say?
Junaid, I shouldn't say this but.. see, this isn't the time when,
the parents would see their daughter being ridiculed. Its now the time when a girl's family ensures she's strong. 
And those who don't, their daughters suffer like Sanaya is. 
 I tried to make Sanaya understand but..
She made me quiet. What can I do? 
 I don't know what Arham is made of? Doesn't he know how difficult it is to make all this.
You're right. Don't mention this to mom. I'll go right now and I'll be back shortly. Okay?
What are you thinking mom? 
 Nothing. 
No. There is something. Tell me whats going on in your mind.
I've been missing Fabiha for the past few days.
Mom.. Fabiha is happy in her house. Don't worry about her. 
 Did you talk to her?
Yes. Just for a bit.
She could come and apologize.
But mom..
I was thinking that Hamza is still disturbed and he hasn't forgotten the insult Fabiha threw his way.
Imagine if Fabiha apologizes to you and starts coming here again,
what if Hamza will dislike it? To think about it, Hamza has helped us a lot.
I pray for Hamza. May God bless him with everything he wants. 
 Just pray that Hamza is blessed with happiness once again.
What are you looking at? 
 Nothing. Should we go?
Where are you lost? Eat.
This is your file. 
 You should have brought mom along.
Mom isn't well since morning. 
 What happened to mom?
She has high blood pressure since morning. 
 Did you take her to the doctor? What did he say?
I'll take her tomorrow. Soumya gave her medicine and made her sleep. Just pray she gets better.
I wanted to come see you. This file is just an excuse.
I wanted to talk to you. 
 What is it? Is everything alright?
See.. I am talking to you as your elder brother.
Don't mind me. I know you're going through a lot right now and its not easy to face everything.
All your hatred, your frustration, everything is legit. I understand.
See, how strongly you're going through everything for the sake of your children.
But Sanaya.. our mother isn't that strong.
I don't think she can withstand your pains anymore.
See, I'll again say, don't mind me.
Whatever you say, it affects her mind. She worries for you day and night.
If you want to talk, talk to Soumya or me. I know you..
must be thinking that I'm only thinking about myself or my house but trust me I'm thinking about our mother.
Mom loves you a lot. But you know without mom..
What will happen to me?
I'm scared, that worrying for you, she might..
what if something happens to her.. 
 God forbid.. Nothing will happen to mom, ever.
In my worries, I forgot this completely. You're right.
Don't worry. I won't talk to mom. But you know, daughters only have their mothers.
And the crutch that a mother is.. we can never think we can fall off it.
When we share our worries with our mothers and get new courage, daughters once again get ready to bear pain with their in laws.
Girls are very strong but I won't talk to mom again. I'll be careful.
I know you're very sensible and I expected you to be this smart.
But if you still mind something, I'm sorry. 
 I swear I didn't mind anything. If Soumya had said it, I might have been offended but you..
You said everything clearly. I didn't mind anything. This is the difference in relationships. If someone understands.
You do know, your brother is always with you.
I'll leave now. Take care. 
 Thank you brother.
Nobody can take Fabiha's place.
Hamza, Fabiha's chapter is closed now. She has moved on in life. Please, you move on as well.
Here's your coffee.. 
 Thank you.
I see you've changed for the better now. 
 Like?
Like you are thinking about a beloved and someone drags you out of those thoughts.
And then you leave those thoughts in the past and come back to the present.
Its this change that I see in you and I'm very satisfied and happy to see this change.
I'm watching that my sister is now getting all the more clever. She can immediately guess whats going on in my heart.
Of course this is so. I used to think Farheen was different from Fabiha and very ill mannered.
But after meeting her I found out that she's very sympathetic and good natured.
I can challenge you. If Farheen had been in Fabiha's place, she would never have deceived you.
Don't worry. The file is in the right hands now.
I have to talk to Arham. 
 You'll have to wait to talk to Arham. Its best if you don't disturb our privacy.
I'm here to talk to my husband, Fabiha. 
 Right now I'm with my husband and you're forgetting this is my room and my husband.
Fabiha, tell her I don't want to talk to her.
I don't think you'll be able to hear anything more. And if you keep standing here, Arham will get in a bad mood and I don't want that. Please leave.
The plot file.
The kids have parent teacher meeting tomorrow and its important for us to go there.
I hope you understand and you'll be ready on time.
I cannot come. I have a meeting.
You know well there is an annual parent teacher meeting and I believe you'll not do anything to tarnish our children's future.
Right now I'm with my husband. You're forgetting this is my room and my husband. 
 Fabiha tell her I don't want to talk.
It seems you couldn't sleep all night. Even your eyes are swollen and your hopes are breaking.
I told you to live peacefully but you liked to eat in a single plate.
Now what can one do if the other person doesn't want to understand?
See, you need to change with time and circumstances. If you had thought about all this along with earning money, things would have been better.
I'll do something in return if you plan to throw me out. I left everything and caught on Arham's weakness.
You're his wife and you know his weakness as well.
What did you tell me? That Arham has just lost his car and then he'll lose a lot of things and I'll have to suffer. Isn't it?
You lost your husband because of your stupidity and I told him to get this plot from you.
And we have to take a lot more now. Like this house, the kids and everything else.
A woman thinks she's powerful is she has a man with her. Its good that you think the same.
But don't think I'm weak.
You clashed with a wife but don't dare butt your head against a mother.
You won't have any power.
Sanaya what happened? 
 I fell down like you but I caught myself.
Listen..
I'm going to the bank for the meeting. Get the kids ready. 
 Okay.
Arham.. your coffee. No matter how late you're getting, I won't let you go without it.
Mom said, if you leave for work without food, you won't get the job done.
Where are you? You didn't have breakfast?
 I'm getting late Sanaya..
You're not getting late. Don't you remember what mom said? If you leave on an empty stomach, you won't get anything done. Just one sip from my hand.
Good boy. One more.. 
 Alright. I'm getting late. 
Have a good day.  Bye..
I'm getting late. Thanks for the coffee.
This is mine. This is mine. Hadi..
This is mine. Its mine.. 
 Whats going on? Enough.
You've played a lot. Get up. You have a shower. You haven't even changed. Dad is coming. We have to go to school. 
Is dad coming with us? 
 Why are you asking this question?
Just like that. Ever since Fabiha aunty came in our house, dad doesn't sleep with us or take us out.
Its not that dear, dad is coming with us. Come on get ready. 
 Alright. Now I'll show dad my senior class.
And mom? 
 You and dad aren't different.
You talk a lot. Who taught you all this? 
 Nobody did.
Now Fabiha aunty doesn't even talk to us.
You have talked a lot. Get up and get ready. If dad doesn't find us ready, he'll be upset. Now hurry up.
Good boy. Be careful.
Hadi? Hurry with your breakfast. 
 Are you done with your breakfast?
Yay.. dad is here. 
 Of course. Lets go. My lion. Lets go.
Lets go Sanaya. Lets go. Where is the school bag?
Arham.. 
 What happened? What happened to you?
Are you okay?
Nothing. I felt dizzy. 
 What do you mean? Lets go to the doctor.
You go with the kids. I'll be fine if I rest. 
 The kids will go with Sanaya. Its okay.
I told you. You're more important. We have to go to the doctor. Sanaya please, take the kids.
You know she's sick. Its important to take her to the doctor.
Come on..
Mom.. Dad has left with Fabiha aunty.. 
 Dear, Fabiha aunty wasn't well. Dad took her to the hospital. Lets go now.
Is Fabiha aunty more important? 
 Everybody's dad will be here and not mine. I'll feel so guilty.
Mom is with you. Why the embarrassment? Wear your bag. If we get late, our teacher will be upset.
And I'll do one thing. I'll call dad. He'll come to the school directly from the hospital. Come on now. 
 Okay mom..
I felt dizzy at that time. Thats it. 
 You don't feel dizzy without a reason.
Why are you scared? We're just visiting a doctor. 
 I'm not scared. Nothing has happened to me. Why see a doctor?
We need to. Be quiet. Its good to get you checked. Its our family doctor. He'll tell us.
I don't want to take any risk where you are concerned.
Where your husband, Sanaya? 
 I'm sorry mam. He had an important meeting. He won't be able to join.
See, you know our school rules. Its important for both parents to be here. 
 I know madam.
Do you know how much parent ignorance can disturb children? Do you have any idea?
