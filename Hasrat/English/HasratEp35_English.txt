What happened to mom? Fabiha call the ambulance. What happened? 
 Mom...
Mom.. 
 Brother.. what happened to mom?
I'm sorry sir. She couldn't survive because of severe heart attack. She's no more.
Everything happened because of me.
Its not like that Arham. Don't blame yourself.
So.. who else should I blame?
The mother who taught me how to live with respect, I insulted her in two minutes.
My mother left this world, upset with me.
You'll see, I'll never be happy. 
 God forbid Arham. What are you saying?
And mothers will never curse their children.
I'm sorry. Leave me alone for a while, please.
Please.. 
 I'll get you water.
I'm getting the car. You people come. 
 Sure.
The pain of losing your mother will never diminish even if someone lends you all their support.
Thank you so much aunty. We need our family during such times. 
 Why thank me? Families come to the rescue in such times.
Aunty.. please make Sanaya understand that this is her house.
After all, a woman's real house is with her husband. 
 Mom, my phone is upstairs. I'll go get it.
I'm Sanaya's mother and I know her pain well.
I cannot see her like this. Sanaya is tolerating everything.
Dear.. take care of yourself. Okay?
Soumya.. I wanted to apologize to you as well. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened.
Whatever happened, lets just forget it. Please pray for your mother. Lets go, mom..
Let Sanaya come.. 
 She'll come mom. Junaid must be there.
I forgot my phone. 
 Here..
Please stay..
I need you.. 
 If I had ever known..
you were alone, I'd have never left.
But you're not alone. 
 Can you see?
I need you very much right now.
Look at me.. I'm all alone.. Please..
Please don't go..
Arham, a person's own mistakes punish him.
You drive away your loved ones so far away that when you need them, they're never there.
I'm alone.. please.
I can feel her presence very much. In this house. In this room. In your life.
And even being so close to you.. I feel like a stranger.
I'm standing here with a lot of difficulty. Who wants to suffocate to death?
Take care of yourself. 
 Then stay back to take care of me.
I'm not used to living without mom, Sanaya..
I'm all alone now.
Throw Fabiha out of your life. I'll come back forever.
This cannot happen.
I cannot leave her. 
 And me?
Not even you..
What happened? Are you missing your mom?
What do you think? You'll regret and mom will forgive you?
You should be ashamed brother. I've not even seen tears in your eyes.
You've hurt mom.. 
 I didn't want to hurt her. I didn't intend to.
But I didn't know how it happened.
What would you do if you were in my situation? 
 You should have been patient. If a mother is upset, it shakes up the 7 skies.
What happened after that? Mom took her pain with her.
You should worry about your forgiveness. 
 You also think I'm responsible?
You are a sinner. You are responsible for your mother's death.
And if you want forgiveness, there is only one way out. 
 What?
You will have to divorce Fabiha.
Right now Sanaya has decided to leave you. Tomorrow, even your kids will leave you.
What will you do then? Did you see mom?
Close your eyes. 
 Why?
Close your eyes. I didn't ask you for your life. 
 If only you had asked me for my life.
If you're done, close your eyes. 
 Alright. Here.
Don't open them. Keep them close. 
 What should I do now?
I'm opening them. Its late. Will you push me down the roof? 
 Open them now.
This? Where did you find this? 
 I just did.
Do you know Fabiha.. its amazing to listen to classical songs with it. It'll make you fall in love again. This is priceless for me.
The favors you've done for me, this isn't anything compared to it. If only you hadn't done me any such favors, I wouldn't have to buy such gifts.
You're too much. 
 Do you like it?
I love it but you don't. I know right now you want...
If you remain like this, you'll never be able to move on in life.
I don't have a reason to live.. I was stupid. 
 Its not important that you get the person you love. 
And that too such a selfish person. Have you ever thought? Have you? What will become of me if something happens to you?
Mom has already left. What will become of me? Should I tell you?
I'll take poison and kill myself.
Are you mad? I'm warning you. 
 Yes, I'm mad.
Because you've gone mad. 
 See, don't you dare say such a thing again.
I will. I will!
Because you are still in love with her!
And our whole family is destroyed because of this love!
Just because of this. And that too such a selfish woman.
For God's sake. Step out of your love life and look around. There's a lot happening around you.
You have a sister in this house.
Your mother is dead. Your love sacrificed your mother.
Now I cannot sacrifice you.
Let it be. You stay here. Celebrate this love.
What happened Arham? Didn't you stop Sanaya mam?
No. She's insistent upon not staying back.
Should I talk to her? 
 No Fabiha.
She isn't listening to her husband. How would she listen to his second wife? She has decided.
She won't budge. 
 Did you ask her what she wants?
She must have something in her mind. 
 She wants me to leave you.
And what did you say?
What do you think?
Fabiha, you're my responsibility and I'll stick by my responsibility at all costs.
But there must be some way. Something can be done.
If only..
I just have you..
Throw Fabiha out of your life and I'll be back forever.
I can't do that. I cannot leave her.
Can I beat coffee for dad? 
 Hareem you'll spoil your clothes. Your uniform..
Carefully.. I'll do it carefully. 
 Alright. Sit down and be careful. I'll fry your egg until then.
What are you doing?
I'm making coffee for dad..
Very good.
You're making this little kid beat coffee?
Then you'll give her the responsibility of the entire house. You've struck a lottery.
Hadia, Hareem insisted. 
 Hareem insisted?
Tomorrow, she'll insist that you light the stove for her, would you do that? 
 What are you saying?
The truth is always bitter.
What do you think? Hareem is an orphan? She doesn't have parents?
Why are you being atrocious to a little kid? 
 You're misusing my silence, Hadia.
If I'm not saying anything, this doesn't mean you'll do whatever you please. 
 Or else...
What will you do? 
 Or else I'll forget that you and I have a relationship.
As if we have a relationship. Throw this misunderstanding out of your head. I or this house has no relationship with you.
Remember one thing Fabiha.. a man can forget his wife but never his children.
And its because of those children, Sanaya is standing on a firm footing in this house. And you'll hear her footsteps real soon.
And you'll listen to my brother's changing decisions. And then you'll be out of this house.
Hamza? Have you packed everything?
Yes. 
 So where have you bought a house?
If you don't want to tell me, its okay.
Actually mom told me about Fabiha.
How did you know about her wedding? 
 I don't want to talk about Fabiha, so please Farheen..
If you want to discuss work, do it or else leave. Don't waste my time like your sister.
Hamza.. I was just expressing my sympathies with you as a human being.
Why are you forgetting that I'm going through the same pain you are?
Oh well.. its your wish.
Come in.
These are loan files. You should check them once.
And yes, I heard about your mother. My condolences. I'm sorry I couldn't attend the funeral.
You know, family is the first priority.
I understand. 
 I just had a son.
All praise to the Lord. 
 You tell me, how are your wife and the kids?
This Sunday its my son's aqiqah, you and your family has to come for sure.
It won't be possible. I'm really sorry. 
 I won't hear a thing. You're coming.
If you don't come, our friendship will end. 
 Alright, I'll try.
Listen.. Congrats.
Most welcome..
Did you check these things? Is it there? 
 Yes.
And this one?
Farheen?
You have to keep this one and this one stocked. 
 Farheen?
Sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like this.
Its alright. Hamza, I can understand your pain.
I went to Sanaya mam's office to return the money. I found out there.
I couldn't tolerate so I went to Arham's house.
What? Did you meet Fabiha? How is she Hamza? 
 She's very happy and peaceful.
I couldn't tolerate her peace. Now I'm uncomfortable.
I never thought Fabiha could do this to me, Farheen.
Hamza.. did your Sanaya mam accept Fabiha?
Maybe.. What option did Fabiha leave for Sanaya mam?
I cannot even curse her. I'll be the one in pain.
Forget Fabiha.
Hamza... see when Fabiha has moved on in her life, why don't you do it too?
What will you get following a shadow? 
 I was under the impression that it was mine.
Divorce papers? 
 Show me..
Think about it once more, Sanaya. Don't take an emotional decision.
Not only your life but two more lives are associated with Arham.
And you cannot take Arham's kids away from him even if you want to.
See Sanaya.. whatever your decision is.. we'll accept it. All of us are with you.
I will just tell you to think before you decide anything.
I don't want you to regret anything later. 
 Think about it once more Sanaya.. this is a big decision.
There is nothing to think about, Soumya.
There is peace in separation.
If we live together, life will be difficult. It wasn't easy for me to take this decision either.
But I took this decision to spend the rest of my life peacefully.
A woman tolerates everything easily.. a man's temper, his agression and all decisions he imposes on her..
But when it comes to sharing.. I will never accept that.
If I compromise today, I won't be able to take any decision in the future, brother.
Please send these papers to Arham.
