Sanaya is right deciding that she is going back home. 
 Only God knows whether this is a right decision or wrong.
But as a mother, I'll pray for her to be happy. But..
Living with her husband's second wife will be difficult for her. 
 Mom, I think Sanaya won't be able to stay there for long.
You keep talking nonsense. Think before you speak. 
 I'm right Junaid.
That girl won't let her stay there for long.
I thought she was only clever but her tongue.. God spare us.
I realize this Soumya.
Sanaya isn't a child. If she decided to go there, she must have thought things through.
She must have strengthened herself to tackle things there. 
 I pray to God that whatever purpose she has gone back for..
May God make her successful. 
 Amen..
You're right.
Here, this one. No.. Try this one.
No. Not this one either. 
 Hadi, go to your room.
You have to do your homework. 
 Mom please, let me play with Fabiha aunty.. 
First we'll do our homework and then we'll play. Come on. Lets go. I'm coming.
How many times have I told you to stay away from my kids?
They're kids. They love me. They come to me themselves. 
 If you scold them once, they'll not come back.
I cannot break their heart. 
 Of course. You join hearts with other people's husbands.
Throw this out of your mind. You cannot throw me out of Arham's life.
I didn't marry Arham to kick you out of his life. I've never wanted this.
Can we forget everything and live together here? If you compromise. 
 Compromise?
Not at all.
What do you think? You'll destroy everything and I'll compromise quietly?
Don't even think about it.
I made this house with love and your greed destroyed it.
Whether I get Arham or not but I won't let stay in Arham's life for long. I promise.
I don't want to fight. 
 You started this fight but I'll end it.
You came in this house without permission, but remember this is my house.
Understand?
Come!
I want her to remember that this is my house. Go. Your husband is calling you.
And let me remind you that this is not only your house. Its mine as well. You should remember that too.
Come Fabiha.
Here mom.. food is here.
Mom.. 
 Yes?
What happened? What are you thinking? 
 Nothing.
There is something mom. Tell me. 
 I was thinking.
I should find a girl and get Hamza married.
What are you saying? 
 Why? Whats wrong in it?
Whoever girl comes in his life will be proud of him.
Fabiha has destroyed her life with her own hands.
She never deserved Hamza.
I don't think Hamza will be ready to get married at any cost.
I'll make him agree and he'll never turn me down.
Alright. Start eating now. 
 Okay. You too.
I've just thrown you out of the room right now. Very soon you'll leave the house too.
And then from Arham's life as well. And I won't do it. Sanaya will.
You must have realized her power. 
 If I'm quiet, this doesn't mean I'm scared.
I know how to claim my right very well. 
 What will you do alone, Fabiha?
You only had Arham's support in this house and you'll lose him too. 
 I don't want to plot and plan, Hadia.
But if I'm forced.. I'll throw you out first. Its best if you consider yourself a guest in this house.
Guests come for a few days. Wives stay for a lifetime. Don't force me. 
 Fabiha!
Its best if you leave. If the argument extends, you'll be the bad guys in your brother's eyes. 
 It won't be me. It'll be you and that too very soon.
My dear, please take your soup. Your aunt made it for you with so much love. Hurry up.
What happened Hadi? Why aren't you eating? Should I help you? 
 No dad. I'll do it myself.
Then eat. 
 Good girl.
How is it, Hareem?
Come on dear. We'll eat in our room. 
 Why mom? Why can't we eat here?
What happened Sanaya? Where are you going? 
 Either she or I will sit on this table. Come dear. 
Let it be. I'll leave. You sit down.
Hurry up and finish it. Very good.
Come on Hadi..
Start.. 
 Sanaya.. you did good. You reminded Fabiha of what she's worth.
And another thing.. you don't have to be afraid of Arham or anybody else. I'm with you.
Eat something. 
 I'm not hungry, Arham.
I'm sorry on behalf of Sanaya. Give Sanaya some time. Everything is new for her. She'll take time to accept it.
Everything will be alright. She'll be used to it. Everything will be okay. 
 She won't get used to anything, Arham.
Fabiha, why don't you think that you took her place? How would she feel? You do know the feeling if someone takes your place.
Life isn't easy. We make it easy by compromising, by being patient and by ignoring.
And you'll have to make use of all these to make your life better.
What happened? What are you thinking? 
 I understand but Sanaya mam is only listening to what Hadia is saying.
What do you mean? 
 Arham, I heard Hadia saying that she'll help Sanaya mam to throw me out.
No. It cannot be. 
 It is so. And you know very well how she did this with Sanaya.
If Hadia goes back to Dubai, problems in the house will be solved. I know she's your sister but..
You'll have to be firm for your house.
Alright. I'll see to it. You eat.
You cannot come inside or sleep here. 
Sanaya, you're forgetting that its my room as well. 
 It might be but from today its only mine.
You might be used to sharing your things with someone but I cannot share my things with anyone. 
I'm not just anyone. I'm your husband. 
 You were. But now you're only my childrens' father.
And I don't want you to feel that if we're together, everything will be alright.
We're in the same house, Arham but not together.
And I don't want to be the bad guy in front of the world. Its best if you leave.
But Sanaya... 
 Please Arham. Are you leaving or should I?
And shut the door before you leave and knock before you come in my room.
Arham, why are you standing here?
What happened?
Arham? 
Sanaya mam shouldn't have thrown you out of your room. This is an insult. How can she throw you? You got married and its not a sin.
And how can the years of love change into hatred in one night?
Fabiha, when your heart breaks, even a few days seem like centuries.
I've broken Sanaya's heart and there can be no patch that can mend it.
What do you think what love is?
Love is just a word. Only a word.
But in reality, love is all those moments that two people spend together.
They see the good and bad in life together. And today, the same moments,
have become hateful memories for Sanaya. We're living under the same roof but we aren't together.
What more can be a bigger punishment? 
 Arham loves means realization, compromise, patience and ignorance. We need all these to keep a relationship alive.
And only the person you cannot live without is important in love. If you convince yourself to live alone, you should understand it wasn't a compromise in love.
It was a compromise with fate. 
 You want to say that Sanaya doesn't love me?
Arham, there is love in relationship and then there is love in your soul.
There are hundreds of women in this world who are tolerating another women for the sake of love and Sanaya mam is a part of this world.
If she thinks this love is important, me being here shouldn't bother her.
Good boy. Come down. Mom will come and give you breakfast. Be careful.
Where is my phone?
I'm here to get my clothes for office. 
 I've kept them in your room.
If you feel you can ask your so-called wife to get your clothes so you won't have a problem.
Excuse me. I'm getting late for work.
Is my breakfast ready? 
 Of course. Go and sit on the table, I'll just bring it.
Here is your sandwich. Finish it fast.
Hadi? Mom will make a sandwich for you. 
 Mom, I eat the sandwich that Fabiha aunty makes.
Mom told you.. I'll make one for you. Okay?
You're wrong. Why are you venting out on Hadi?
You're the child in this house. Not them. Am I speaking Persian? Don't you understand?
How many times have I told you to stay away from my kids? You cannot attract them to you by doing things for them.
You've snatched my husband. I'll not let you snatch my children. 
 I understand everything.
But you're not understanding anything. You're proving yourself as a tyrant to Arham even when you're suffering.
When you do all this, you're displaying yourself as the bad guy. You're driving away Arham. Do you know that?
Oh well. I really wanted to live together. But since you're not in the mood, why should I be stupid and give you whats mine.
You're happy staying away from Arham and I'm happy with him. 
 Stupid girls like you think the same.
You think if you trim a piegon's feathers, he'll forget to fly.
He'll stay in your cage for a few days but as soon as he gets a chance, he'll deceive you and fly away.
A man is the same. As soon as he gets a chance, he'll go astray. Its his nature.
And what is it for a man? He couldn't be mine. How can he be yours?
But you should trim his feathers carefully.. Your pigeon might fly away too soon.
Fabiha? Fabiha? Where is my tie?
I'll come and give it to you myself. Come. 
Mom, my sandwich? 
 I'm bringing it dear. Just a moment.
Hadi? Hadi? What happened? Tell me why are you crying? 
 Hadi?
Where is my son? Hadi? Where is my dear? I think my son is upset with me.
Mom, what happened to Hadi? Is he upset? 
 He's very upset.
I don't want to eat the sandwich you made. I want the one Fabiha aunty made. 
 My dear..
Mom always made your sandwich... 
 I don't want it.
Hadi.. stop. Eat it..
Its okay dear. You pack your bag.
Hamza? You here? So early?
You should be at work. 
 Yes. I was passing by so I thought I'd pick you. You'll have to travel by bus otherwise.
But I'm not even ready yet and I have to give breakfast to mom.
So its alright. I'll wait for a while. You can get ready.
Alright. Give me ten minutes. You sit inside. I'll go and get ready.
Hamza? 
 Hello.
Hello. How come you're here?
I was passing by for work, I thought I'd pick Farheen up.
She'll save the fare and she won't get bothered in the bus.
Mom, I've set your breakfast. Hamza and I will leave for work now.
Alright. Bye. 
 Bye dear.
Have the kids gone to school? 
 They're in their room.
When are you going back? 
 Why brother?
Am I burden on you? 
 Its not that. I'm just asking.
I don't want to have breakfast. I don't want to have breakfast. 
 Hadi, listen to me.  
What happened Sanaya? 
 He's upset.
I'm very upset. I'll not talk to anyone. Its enough.
Dad, why are you so angry right now?
First you tell me why are you angry? 
 Dad, Fabiha aunty made a sandwich for me but mom took it away.
And she said I shouldn't eat it. Why is mom so angry? She isn't letting me play with Fabiha aunty?
Actually.. your breakfast was late Hadi.. thats why.
I'll ask fabiha aunty to make your breakfast on time. Then mom won't be angry. Now have breakfast. Your van will come. You have to go to school.
Dad, you tell me, why were you angry? 
 Oh yes.. But you calmed down.
Dad also calmed down. Now come and have breakfast. Good boy.
Come on..
What are you doing? 
 Oh I'm helping you. What else? Didn't you hear what your brother said?
Right now I'm not going anywhere. 
 Hadia, you'll have to leave.
Now it depends upon you how you'll leave. With respect or after an insult.
This is my mother's house. 
 So she's gone? She won't come back. And what will you do waiting. Tell me.
I told you to not take my silence as my weakness. I don't want your brother to drag you to the airport forcibly.
So its best if you leave with respect. And yes..
Pack everything once and for all. You don't know if you're coming back ever.
So pack well? Alright?
Here...
Hello mom. 
 Hello. How are you dear?
My happiness is upset with me mom. I don't know how I'll travel this journey.
Sanaya.. you will travel and this journey will end.
You just have to be courageous and patient to reach your destination. 
 Thats what I cannot see, mom.
Dear, we don't anything get more than our fate and before time. And whatever you have..
Try and find your happiness in that. You should try. 
 I try my best to forgive Arham.
But whenever I think about forgiving Arham, my self respect makes me selfish, mom.
I'm here only for my kids. My relationship with Arham is over since long. 
 Try and give your relationship another chance, dear.
I'm your mother. I'll never think bad for you. A husband is the only protector of his wife.
Otherwise, this selfish world will eat you away. Understand what I'm saying.
I've asked the van driver to drop the kids to you. Call me as soon as they're home.
I'll talk to you later. Bye..
