This is something to celebrate, let me feed this cake to Farheen.
Many congratulations to you on your sister's birthday. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth... come on...
Are you afraid?
Afraid of what?
Afraid of..
losing me...
I have full faith in my love and I'm proud of it as well.
And I will never let this pride break.
Mother you called?
Do you answer my bell everyday? Why would I call you?
Where's Fabiha?
She's not here yet.
She's very punctual, she's never late.
Pick this phone up, let me ask her why she's late.
It isn't time for her to arrive. There's nothing to worry about.
Should I worry about you if not her?
Who takes care of me from morning till evening? She injects me with insulin in the morning and stays with till evening tea.
You were never able to do that. You could never move past being my daughter-in-law.
And she...
But she became like my daughter in a few days
Now go... why are you standing here? Are you not getting late for work?
She can't do anything.
Arhum what's the matter? Why didn't you go to work? Are you feeling well?
Yes... it's just a little cough.
You haven't eaten anything as well.
No... I don't feel like it.
If you don't eat, you won't be able to have your medicine.
Where's Shenaya?
She went to work. She had a meeting
My God!
A meeting is more important to her than her husband
It's not that good to be so irresponsible.
She should have given you importance right now.
But no...
Her greed for money takes preference over her husband
No mother, it's not like that. I was the one who asked to her to go.
Enough.
There is no need for you to defend her.
Fabiha... make him ginger and cinnamon tea.
Sure...
You know I don't like it.
You need it right now and you'll have to.
Once you have your tea... and then I'll send you breakfast. Go and rest. If you need anything call me.
Fabiha... just take a small piece of ginger.
Sorry...
Your tea.
This is so bitter... please take it away.
It is supposed to be a little bitter. If you don't drink it you'll stay like this for a week.
Every bitter tasting thing has healing properties. You take medicine as well.
Drink this, thinking that it is medicine.
Alright.
Fabiha...
Send me your account details, it will be easier to give you your salary.
I don't remember it.
Alright fine, you can text me.
I don't have your phone number.
Write down my number.
Why don't you save my number...
Sure...
Please tell me.
Thank you.
Every bitter tasting thing has healing properties. You take medicine as well. Drink this, thinking that it is medicine.
I can't drink it.
Tell me, did he drink his tea?
I gave it to him.
You should have made him drink it in front of you.
I'm telling you, ever since he was a kid he has a habit...
Whenever he got sick, he never liked going to the doctor.
Nor did he like any home remedy
I thought that he would change after his marriage...
but his wife was different. He won't drink it, I'm sure of it.
I have full faith that he will.
Really..
What have you told him?
Somethings effect a person's heart and brain.
I said something similar.
Why are you so surprised about it?
I was thinking what you did that Shenaya couldn't manage to do all this time.
It's all about time.
Sometimes we are unable to understand the person in front of us.
Or that the person in front of us is unable to make us understand.
But time makes us understand everything.
You are very wise.
Arhum, are you listening.
Yes.
Yes Shenaya.
What's the matter? Where is your attention?
I was on the terrace to catch some fresh air.
Okay... I have to know who took my husband's attention away from me
Possessive... wow....
Of course.
I am possessive over you.
Anyways, forget this... I've taken the doctor's appointment. Be prepared at night. Bye.
Okay bye.
Greetings mother.
You're here.
Mother...
What's the matter?
Freshen up, I'll serve lunch.
I've cooked and Somia used to make it everyday.
Sit down...
I promised that I will convince Somia to come back.
Still you're worried. You know you get sick.
What's the point in my living if I can't see my son happy?
Who told you that I'm unhappy?
What are you saying?
My dear, you can stay happy without your mother.
But a father cannot be happy without his daughter.
I'm your mother, I know that very well.
I just talked to Anayah in the morning. I talked to Somia as well.
Everything will be alright in a few days, why are you worrying?
Things are hard now, but it will pass. You know I need you, in good times and bad.
Please be alright.
I'm with you my dear.
Junaid, I'm with you, I always will be.
I'll serve lunch.
Mother... mother...
Are you okay?
Wait a second.
I don't know what's happening.
Mother...
Did you take your blood pressure and sugar medcine in the morning?
I don't know.
Sit down, I'll bring your medicine.
My God... what's happening?
I'll bring food.. wait a second.
Do you know I have a function at my school tomorrow and I'll perform.
Oh really and what are you going to perform?
I will end evil.
Oh really... and...
And I will kill anyone who is our enemy.
How?
I feel afraid.
Why are you afraid? You're not our enemy.
That's true...
Will you come to see my performance?
Who will stay with your granny if I come to see your performance?
If you don't come... I will be upset with you.
Make him understand.
I'm sorry, he's upset at you, it's your job to cheer him up.
Even if I come there what will I get?
Ice-cream...
Yes... that too chocolate.
Alright done!
You are very nice.
I know.
I know...
Yes Hamza?
I've been calling you for ages, where are you?
Where can I be right now?
I'm at the bus stop right now. The one I gave my bike to...
I wanted to take my bike from him, but he's out of the city.
He'll be back tomorrow and I'll start picking you up. Just manage today.
The bus is here, I'll talk to you once I reach home.
Farewell*
Send me your account details, it will be easier to send you your salary.
Where are you going?
I have a meeting with Faurkh, I need to give him some details.
But we're going to the doctor, right?
No need, I'm fine... check it out.
But I took an appointment.
Cancel it then.
Ever since I drank some tea and applied some balm, I've been feeling better.
You drank tea?
I know, it's better than any bitter medicine.
Who made it for you?
Fabiha did.
I'll see you in the evening.
Did Hamza not come to pick you up today?
I'm waiting for the bus. I'll leave once it's here.
I'll drop you off...
No need, I'm used to it. Don't bother yourself.
It's okay, I won't drop you daily. Please get in.
Did you send money in my account?
Yes I did.
May I know the reason?
Fabiha... I overheard you talking to mother.
and it was mother's wish as well.
And I thought it was better for me to help you, so I did.
It was nice to see that there are still human beings in this world.
But I cannot take this money from you.
There is no need for you to do that.
I know that someone who comes out of fear does not like going back to that place.
That's why please... don't return this money. I'll deduct it from your salary.
But...
No buts...please...
Don't worry, I'm an honorable man, I don't need anything in return.
Where?
Straight from here.
Sometimes one is so compelled that it's very hard to refuse.
Maybe that's the reason I couldn't refuse. But don't worry I'll return your money.
You seem honorable.
Just make sure...
that you don't cry in front of mother.
We've made you responsible for her.
Just take care of her... and stay away from the kids.
Brother, mother is calling you. 
Is is something important? I'm sure you know... do tell me...
I don't know...
Don't act in front of me... tell me what it is.
Auntie Shamsi called, she's coming next month.
With Alishba.
I came here to tell you this because we have to pick her clothes from the tailor.
Why is she coming?
She's coming next month.
Whether a disaster comes now or a month later, it's still a disaster.
Should we ask sister Fabiha to ask Alishba...
why she's coming.
Don't you dare say her name in front of Fabiha.
Alishba is calling you... sorry Fabiha is...
Hello...
Hamza, I wanted to talk about something important.
Sure what is it?
I arranged the money to payback Haroon, and I've sent him the money. Let him know.
From where did you get the money?
Arhum gave it to me, he'll cut it from my salary.
Alright.
Greetings*
How was your meeting?
The meeting went fine and God willing, my promotion is almost guaranteed.
Very good...
Arhum... I was thinking the loan you go approved...
I was thinking of paying back my loan from it. To cut down the expenses.
What do you say?
Arhum... I'm talking to you.
Can I pay my loan back with the money you got from your loan?
Shenaya I forgot to tell you...
What?
That money...
I gave to Fabiha. She was in trouble.
What?
What about our need?
You didn't ask me once before giving her that money. You gave that amount, that too to a caretaker.
It's good to help people. We'll cut it from her salary...
We could have given her a few thousand if you wanted to help her...
What need was there to give her money in lacs?
We could have gotten so many things done using that money.
You know you how much we've tolerated...
for that money.
Shenaya try to understand. Mother asked me, so I was bound to help her...
Listen to me.... please 
There's no need to worry, I'm an honorable man, I won't ask anything in return.
Who was that?
Who?
The one from whose car you got off of today, with hopes and dreams.
These were your dreams right?
A big bungalow... a car... money.
But... there is no car here, nor anyone who owns a car.
Sister, think before you speak.
You are the one who seems lost in her thoughts.
It's not how you think.
He's someone's husband and a father to two. He came to drop me off just as a gesture.
Gesture?
Oh... but Fabiha...
No one has ever showed you this gesture before.
Sister please...
I don't want to argue with your right now.
Of course...
Why would you talk to me now?
But... your madam is very fortunate.
She has a big house... a car... money and a handsome husband.
I just read it on Facebook yesterday. All in one.
And then there's Hamza.
To tell you the truth, you can turn fortune in your favor.
Learn to use your opportunities. It will fix your life.
Fabiha...
I'm sure you have his picture on Whatsapp...
What's the matter with you sister...
I just want to see how he looks upfront.
He's in even more handsome upfront.
He doesn't seem like he has two kids.
And... he dropped you off at home. So he has kind heart as well.
Will you say anything?
Fabiha...
When one's needs aren't met...
then they become desires...
Then one gets buried beneath those desires.
Be careful.
To tell you the truth, you can turn fortune in your favor.
Learn to use your opportunities. It will fix your life.
What's the matter?
Uh...
I've...
returned Haroon his money.
Who did you take it from?
Hamza?
He's Hamza, not the son of a minister.
So... then who?
Arhum's...
mother.
Arhum's mother.
Alright.
She seems like a nice woman.
May God bless her for this.
Amen.
Mother, I'll get going...
please don't try to fight with sister anymore.
Don't worry, I won't.
I have to go.
This is your sandwich... what will you have?
Fried egg or omelet?
Whatever you want. I'll bring mother.
Mother... can you feed me?
I cannot, I have a lot to do before work.
I have to make omelet for your father. You sister is eating on her own.
I promise, I'll feed you starting from tomorrow.
Auntie Fabiha is here!
You look so nice!
Will you come to my school?
I will try to.
Fabiha is here as well.
Greetings*
Get me some juice.
No, like everyday, your insulin comes first.
Alright fine.
I'll be right back.
Mom... what's the matter...
You're in such a great mood ever since Fabiha arrived.
Not only me, our entire house has changed ever since Fabiha came here.
There is no reason to fight or argue.
This girl has changed everything.
If you needed money, then why didn't you ask  me?
Why did you talk to mother?
You have it wrong, I didn't ask her for money... I was just..
You were crying to get her sympathy and then you're saying that she offered you the money...
There is a difference in a few thousand and a few lacs...
I told you before... you should...
only focus on what we hired you to do.
Sure... sometimes one is so compelled...
that it's hard to refuse.
Maybe that's why I couldn't refuse. But don't worry, I'll return your money
You seem honorable.
Just take care...
that this doesn't happen again.
We've made you responsible for her...
Just take care of her... stay away from the kids.
You have a function at your school today...
Come on Fabiha, why don't you have breakfast with us.
No, I already had it at home...
Auntie Fabiha, will you come to my school?
How will she?
Who will stay with granny if she does? Now finish your breakfast.
It's not a big deal, it's only for a few hours.
I managed to live alone before, when you went to work.
Let the kids be happy.
I'm running late for work, farewell mother.
Sure my dear.
The school van is here.
Go ahead. Farewell*
Hadi has invited you to school, you should surely go, otherwise the poor kid will be heart broken.
Mine too.
How will you go?
I'll catch a rickshaw.
Why would you do that? I'll ask Arhum to pick you up.
No need to ask him.
Come along, I'll bring your breakfast to you room.
That's sounds great.
I'll have breakfast in my room.
Come in.
Hamza, have a seat.
Hamza, pay attention to what I'm saying.
Don't think that I'm criticizing Fabiha, there are certain things that I don't like about her.
Like?
Asking mother for a loan.
Being frank with my kids, the rest I expect you to understand.
It would be better if things remain professional.
I've talked to her, be sure to talk to her as well.
Sure... I'll talk to her.
I won't give you a chance to complain.
Okay.
Yes... Arhum I'm ready. I'm leaving.
Don't use your other hand.
What's the matter?
You seem worried.
No, it's nothing like that.
Look at me.
Did Shenaya say something?
No.
Will you hide things from me?
I told you that you don't need to be afraid of anyone.
It's not like I'll go and tell someone.
You shouldn't have talked to Arhum about the money.
So Shenaya told you off about that.
Please don't say anything to anyone.
Please don't say anything to anyone. This job is important to me.
If something happens this time, miss Shenaya will fire me.
How can she do that? I'm telling you...
no would dare fire you whilst I'm here. Get that through your head.
But still, I don't want anything to happen because of me.
Alright fine, don't worry. I'm just glad things got sorted out for you.
Let her say whatever she wants.
I will never forget this favor.
I would be doing you a favor if you were a stranger, but you're family.
You're going to visit the kids at school, right?
No... there is a lot to do at home. 
Hadi is a kid, I'll be able to cheer him up.
What about me?
What will you do if I get upset?
Why would you get upset?
He's my grandson, his happiness means the world to me.
And don't even bother worrying about Shenaya.
Are you going there or not?
Umm... I have a condition...
What is that?
Give me your hand.
And press this ten times...
Ten?
Only then I'll go.
Okay alright... I'll accept...
Oh my God...
Mother, I'll talk to you later. I have to go to Hadi's school. He has a performance today.
Hello... hello.. mother... hello.
Hello!
