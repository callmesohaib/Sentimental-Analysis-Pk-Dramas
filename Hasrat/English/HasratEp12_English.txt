Shaheen, why are you so tensed that you've become bedridden?
I just keep thinking that both my daughters will go far away from me.
I just keep thinking that both my daughters will go far away from me.
This is how the world is. Every parent has to send off their daughters one day.
Which parents will want to keep their daughters at home? If you allow today, we'll take Fabiha with us.
You took my words. Lets just decide a date.
How can we just finalize a day? I mean, I'm your only son, mom..
And yours as well. And both of you will have to wear a saree on our wedding.
How can you wear a saree in this condition? And this is why until you're alright and the doctor gives you a health certificate,
I will not get married until then.
But dear... 
 No ifs and buts. No questions. I've told you.
And our happiness isn't more than your health.
Your son is very hardworking and capable.
He never hurts anyone. But seriously, he knows how to sweet talk.
Fabiha, dear, go and get some tea dear. 
 Yes mom..
My child.. my dear.. 
 Oh my God..
My dear looks so cute. 
 Hello.
How are you? 
 Thank you.
Hello aunty. 
 Hello. May you live long.
How are you? 
 I'm fine. You?
Come on in, Arham. 
Be careful..
How are you? 
 I'm absolutely fine. You tell me.
What can I say.. Usually such things,
are said during weddings or funerals.
But its not the two. No wedding, no funeral. Its a happy occasion.
We should forget all complaints on such happy occasions. 
 What are you saying?
We have no complaints for you in our heart. As it is, you've realized, its enough for us.
No. I have a complaint.
What complaint do you have? 
 Ever since you got married to Sanaya..
You have taken away all our rights on her. She's encumbered by the house chores all day.
She has forgotten her own family.
Its not the brother's and sister in law's responsibility to do all the servicing.
No. Its not that. Arham always keep on telling me.
I cannot make time. 
 How will you make time? The time you have left is spend with your husband and kids.
I'd tell you take care of yourself. Have you looked at yourself? You've become so weak.
I'd say, health is wealth. 
 What are you talking about?
Leave all this. I think we should get dinner now. 
 Thats a good decision.
I'm very hungry. 
 So hows your job coming along?
Its coming along fine.
So, what was Sanaya telling you alone in the room?
Why? Were you spying on us?
Don't change the topic. Tell me what was she saying?
Nothing. She just wanted a loan. 
 How much?
Around half a million. 
 Half a million? Oh..
Thats why Arham brought his wife and children here.
What do you mean? 
 I mean, he wants something. Thats why he came here.
I'm noting. You're turning against Arham very much. 
 I gave him a lot of respect, Junaid.
But he lost his respect himself. 
 Soumya..
Please, its done. He has apologized to us.
He was in need so indeed he would apologize.
And Arham did that too. You would have said yes immediately for the money.
What could I do? Should I have said no to my sister and broken her heart?
So listen to me now. You'll not give any money this time.
Junaid can never say no to me. He'll transfer the money in a day or two.
So should I say no to the loan in the office? 
 Yes. You should.
What happened? You seem tired. 
 I was busy with mom all day.
Then the dinner. I'm tired now.
Then come here.. 
 Arham, what are you doing?
I'll give you a head massage today. 
 You'll do it?
Take the opportunity. 
 Of course. I'm lucky to get it. Go ahead.
Oh wow.. May you live long.
I'll explain a few things. See, all the spices are here.
The tea and sugar is here. Mom's porridge is here too.
The plates are here. And everything else.. milk, chicken and vegetables,
in the fridge. Mom's insulin as well.
No matter how much mom insists, don't give her anything to eat without the insulin.
Alright? 
 Okay.
Go out from here, straight from the left is mom's room. Okay? I've kept her clothes there. I'm getting late for work.
And I haven't given her breakfast. You'll give it to her. Alright?
Aunty, what are you doing?
Sit straight or else you'll fall down. You want water? Here..
Who are you? What are you doing here? 
 I'm your caretaker and my name is Fabiha.
And from now, if you need anything, you should tell me. 
I've made you breakfast but before that we'll take insulin. 
 Oh...
Arham? 
 Nobody is home aunty. Everybody has gone to their office. I'm here for you.
Alright. So a maid will give me breakfast now?
I don't want breakfast. Leave my house.
What did you do aunty?
Go away from here.. 
 Listen to me. Lets have breakfast first and then I'll leave.
Can't you hear me? Leave.
Mam? 
 Im in a meeting. Thank you. Send Haris to me.
Hello? 
 Sanaya did you call at home?
No. I'll call now. I was in a meeting. 
 Alright. You do that.
And talk to Junaid as well. Bye. 
 Okay.
Mom? Mom? I want to talk to you right now.
What happened? Why are you so angry? What is it? 
 Mom...
Once the daughters are married, she shouldn't have any concerns about what her sister in law wears, eat or how much money her husband haves.
Dear, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Tell me directly. 
 Mom, I don't understand what Sanaya wants from us.
Her kids stay here.. I have no problem with that. But I'll not tolerate that Junaid is worried because of Sanaya.
I don't know what Sanaya and Junaid talked about. How can I say anything? 
 I'll tell you..
Sanaya has asked Junaid for half a million yesterday. And Junaid doesn't have extra money to spend on Sanaya.
Maybe Sanaya needs the money. She'll only ask Junaid. She has never asked before.
Mom.. you're being told for the first time because Junaid doesn't like things between him and Sanaya to reach you.
Thats why I'm always quiet. Mom, but Junaid also has responsibilities. He has a wife and a daughter.
We have your responsibility and we've never turned down our responsibility.
Sanaya is taking advantage of his simplicity and I'll not tolerate this at all. 
 Don't worry dear, I'll talk to Sanaya.
Whatever it is, I'll explain him myself. 
 Alright.
It would be best that you explain her. 
 Okay.
Listen? 
 Yes?
Drop the kids to their house.
Mam told me to drop them here. 
 And what am I telling you?
Auntie, this cannot be. 
 Sit inside. Sit!
And get off at your house next time. And call their mother and tell her.
Why are you sending Hareem to her house? 
 You go inside.
Aunty, mom will not be at home. We'll be alone.
Come and sit dear.
You're back again. You're very stubborn. 
 Aunty, its important to give you insulin.
Where is the insulin aunty? I kept it here.
How would I know where it is?
Please tell me where is the insulin? I left it here.
Aunty please tell me where did you keep the insulin?
Aunty please.. if Sanaya mam finds out, she'll throw me out. I've got this one job after a lot of difficulty. Where is it?
I don't know. I told you.
Aunty please tell me where did you keep the insulin. If Sanaya mam finds out, she'll...
Please tell me where did you keep it..
I'm the sole breadwinner of my house. I need to get my mom's medicines. There is so much to do. Where is the insulin? Please tell me.
Why? Don't you have a brother or a father?
Those who have brothers and fathers, their daughters live peacefully. They don't struggle like me.
Please tell me where did you keep the insulin? I cannot jeopardize this job.
Please tell me where did you keep the insulin? Please.
Grandma, I'm here. 
 Oh my dear..
Where are Hadi and Hareem? I can't see them.
Yes mom, I sent them home with the driver. 
 What? You sent them home?
But there will be nobody at home at this time. Nor Arham, nor Sanaya.
Mom she should realize that all responsibilities don't fall to her family.
Her children are being looked after here and so Sanaya thinks we'll support her financially as well.
She should realize that she's married now. 
 Soumya, you did wrong.
I'm alive to take decisions right now. 
 Aunty, I've done good to Sanaya for long. Not anymore.
They say the children are staying at their grandma's but it falls down to her daughter in law to change and feed them.
And now I won't take any responsibility of Sanaya's children on my head, mom.
Come Inaya.. 
 Oh...
Yes? 
 I called to ask about mom. How is she? Did you give her insulin? Did she eat?
Yes. I did. It was a little difficult but I handled it.
Alright. I'll be back by 6.30. Handle things until then. 
 Yes. Alright.
Hello? Come here..
Whats your name? 
 Hadi..
Oh wow. Its a beautiful name. And you?
Why should I tell you my name?
Hmm.. it seems someone was scolded at school. 
 No..
Our aunt threw us out.. 
 Hadi!
Didn't mom tell you to not tell family things to strangers?
Come from here now!
Mom.. I've brought you lunch.
I don't want to eat what you cooked. Take it away. Fabiha will come and give me food.
Mom, Fabiha only knows how to earn money. She doesn't know house chores. Now stop being stubborn and eat.
Whats wrong mom? If you don't eat, how will I give you medicine?
What do you care if I die? As it is, you've killed me.
Your stubborn attitude forced me to be selfish.
Rather than accepting your mistake, you're being persistent, Farheen. 
 What mistake, mom?
I had a right to the jewelry alongside Fabiha. 
 So you could have asked me for them? Why steal?
I did ask you. But what did I get in return? Lectures about being patient and advises to leave Haris.
You have nothing else to give me. Mom..
I made my fortune myself otherwise you had not left anything in it for me.
Don't let your tongue and character lead you astray that nobody supports you in your bad times.
Bad times are now gone, mom. My good time will start now and the bad shall not return, if God wills.
You must have talked to Haris.
Yes. I did.
Now if he calls you, ask him to take you away in a month.
Here's a yummy sandwich. Here..
I don't want bread and butter. 
 Hadi, nothing is cooked. Please eat. Mom isn't home.
Alright fine. You want milk? 
 I don't want bread or..
this milk.. 
 Hadi, eat. We don't have anything to eat.
Why are you upset? 
 I'm hungry and I don't want to eat bread and butter.
Alright. So Hadi's hungry. What will you eat? Fries?
Do you know how to make them? 
 Of course I do. Come. I'll show you.
Hareem, aunty is making fries for us.
You can eat. I don't want to eat.
You sit here. I'll make fries for you. Hareem will come too.
Hello mom. I was about to call you. Are the children home?
First leave all this and tell me, did you ask Junaid for money? 
 What happened mom?
Answer me first, Sanaya.
Did Soumaya say something? 
 Listen to me carefully. Call Junaid and tell him you don't need the money.
Tell me something first. And if tell Junaid I don't need them, what will I tell Arham?
I've told Arham that Junaid will give me the money. 
 Do as I say, Sanaya.
I don't want my daughter to be the reason of this negative atmosphere in my house.
And don't worry about Arham, I won't let you be embarrassed in front of him.
I'll give you money from my deposit. As much as you need.
Don't take anything from Junaid. Understand? 
 This means, its Soumaya.
She has created a ruckus at home. And do you know?
She didn't even ask me and sent the children back home. Its the limit. 
 What?
Why did you have to vent out on the kids? Had I known she would create such a scene, I wouldn't have asked Junaid for the money.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Hello? 
 Fabiha, are the kids home?
Yes they are. 
 Okay. I'm coming home. 
You don't have to come. Its alright. I'll look after them.
Are you sure? 
 Don't worry. They're my responsibility until you come back.
Okay. Thank you. 
 You're welcome.
Alright? 
 Fine. Give me the keys to the bike.
Alright. I've seen the quotation from Affan Industries. Do one thing and recheck.
Alright. Sort out the problems and tell me. One minute. Hello? 
 Sir, I'm calling from the bank.
This is a reminder call.
 One second. I'll see you at the board.
Yes tell me. 
 You'll have to clear your payment by this month's end.
I know. I'll do it. 
 Sir, the reason to remind you is that there will be a penalty if the payment isn't cleared.
And the penalty is.. 
 I'm an accounts person. I know everything. Don't call again. I'll clear it.
Yes. Hello. What happened? All fine?
You don't want the money? The reason?
Did Soumya say something? 
 Why would she something?
Arham has arranged from somewhere else. Don't worry. I don't need them. 
 See..
I know you're hiding something from me. You don't need to be scared.
Nobody has the right to interfere in siblings matter. No matter if its Soumya. Understand?
Now tell me, what is it? 
 Its nothing. Please don't worry.
I am worried because Soumya had an argument with me regarding the money and now you're saying no.
This cannot be a coincidence. 
 Whatever it is brother, you're not discussing this with Soumya.
She will think I complained about her, without any reason. 
 Alright.
I can clearly feel that Soumya's resentment has reached you. Thats why you're saying no to the money.
Its nothing like that. If I really need the money, I'll call you again.
Okay?
What happened Sanaya? Did Junaid transfer the money?
The bank is calling again and again.
Are you alright? 7.. 3.. very good.
What comes next? 8.. very good.
Where are Hareem and Hadi, Soumya? 
 Mom sent them back as soon as they came.
What? What is Inaya saying?
I'm talking to you Soumya. 
 So I sent them home. So?
Aren't you ashamed? You sent those little kids back home, alone?
Their parents aren't home. Do you even care what they would have eaten?
And as it is, mom is still here. How come you're taking decisions in her place?
I am a member of this family, Junaid. I have a will. 
 So exercise that will on me!
Why do you have a problem with my mother and sister? 
 Had I been able to exercise my will on you, there would be no problem.
Until it was responsibility, it was alright. But now its finances. I'm not tolerating it.
The child is here. Lower your volume. Sanaya didn't tell me anything but your tone has cleared everything.
Sanaya didn't tell you anything but the mother and daughter have turned the husband against his wife.
Soumya..
I didn't expect this of you. 
 The sister is lovesick for her husband and the brother is worried for his sister.
Oh God.. walking is hell!
It would be nightfall by I reach Fabiha. I'll have to make some arrangements.
Hello? 
 Have you vented out with your poison? Turned Junaid against me by filling his ears?
If you don't get the money, will you set your brother and sister in law's life on fire?
You are mistaken. I didn't say anything to Junaid.
Yes, he had a revelation and thats why he argued with me as soon as he got back from work.
Soumya, I just said no to the money. 
 You became great by saying no to taking money.
And I'm the bad guy. 
 Trust me, I didn't say anything to Junaid. I didn't even talk to Arham.
See Sanaya, listen to me carefully. If you want to keep seeing your family forever,
then be careful that your problems with your inlaws don't reach me and Junaid.
You couldn't make a place for yourself in your in laws. Now you'll lose your own family. You're sensible..
You can think good and bad for yourself.
Listen to me, Soumya..
Hadi? Hareem? 
 Arham...
Hello aunty.. 
 Hello.
I was here to pick up the kids.
Arham.. actually the kids.. 
 They have gone back home, Arham.
What do you mean? They're home? How could they go alone? 
 Yes.
Because it is important to make you realize that you cannot expect your wife's family to do everything.
Soumya.. 
 What Soumya, Junaid? I'm right.
He should know that he's the son in law of the family, not a son.
And a son's responsibility should be fulfilled by his own mother, not his mother in law or her family.
If you say another word, it'll be worse. Be quiet.
Alright, you don't care about the son in law but the kids are innocent.
And you.. you're their grandmother, you could have stopped them.
Arham, I'm embarrassed.. 
 I am the one whose embarrassed in front of my own kids.
I didn't expect this of you, aunty. Soumya, I..
grateful to you for reminding me of my responsibilities. I'll remember them from now..
Bye. 
 Arham.. Arham.. Listen to me.
Arham..
Why did you have to say this nonsense?
So what should we make fly now? Hmm...
Hadi.. 
 Alright, lets fly Hadi..
Okay, come on.. 
 The piegons fly.
Next.. 
 The crow flies.
Hareem? 
 You want to make Hareem fly?
Dear, you can play too. Alright, so whats next?
Eagles? 
 But we just did that..
Sanaya?
Dad.. Dad's here.. Dad!
Are you alright? 
 Dad, aunt threw us out and didn't even give us lunch.
Dad but Fabiha aunty gave us yummy fries to eat..
Thank you. Did you eat anything?
Hareem didn't eat anything. And she misbehaved with Fabiha aunty as well. 
Hareem?
Bad manners dear.. Say sorry. 
 No its okay. She's a kid.
I don't want to talk to her. 
 Bad manners. Say sorry to aunty.
I'm sorry. 
 Its okay.
I'm sorry on her behalf. She doesn't bond with anyone fast. I'm really sorry.
Its alright. The kids were upset so I..
We honored Soumaya and this is how she pays us back!
She insulted my son in law and threw him out. I've always taken Soumya as Sanaya.
Not a daughter in law but a daughter and its the limit!
She insulted me in front of my daughter's in laws. 
 Mom..
Whatever Sanaya's in laws did with Soumya in the past, she hasn't been able to forgo it.
Soumya hasn't even tolerated a pinch of what my daughter is going through with her in laws.
Daughter in laws have to drink patience to live with thier in laws. You don't get respect if you ask for it.
You have to win it with your attitude. If I don't say anything to her, it doesn't mean there's no elder in the house.
Mom.. please don't worry. Relax. I'll talk to her. Okay? 
 Explain it to her.
Otherwise, it won't take time for her to become my daughter in law!
I'm telling you. Don't worry. You get ill if you worry. I'll talk to her. 
 Junaid..
I'm just worried about Sanaya.
If she is in pain, only her mother feels her pain.
Only her mother.. you cannot understand that..
Make her understand.. 
 Relax mom.. please.
You trusted your family very much. They couldn't keep the kids for a few days. You got me insulted.
We asked for money but this didn't mean they'd call off their relationship.
Please, lower your volume. The kids are sitting. 
 She threw these kids out. They came home all alone.
I'll talk to Junaid. 
 What will you talk? Will you apologize?
Or else you'll ask me to apologize. 
 No Arham. I don't want that. I'll not say that.
In fact, I'll tell Junaid how upset I am. 
 If they cared about you being upset, this wouldn't happen.
Do you understand? I didn't expect anything from your sister in law but your mother.. she's their grandmother.
She could think.. They're just kids..
Mom didn't know.. 
 I'm warning you. Don't advocate for your mother today.
You're mistaken. Mom didn't know. 
 Am I mistaken?
Am I wrong today? I was insulted because of the one wrong decision you took!
And you're saying I'm wrong? Mom was right. I'd realize the day they'll throw my kids out.
And this happened today. Remember this, these kids will not go there again, after today, Sanaya!
Its enough. And if you be stubborn, I'll stop you from going there as well. Give the kids dinner and put them to sleep.
