I had expected that you'd be very angry as soon as you heard it.
But I have to agree, you have a strong heart. You're still in this house.
What did you tell my kids? 
 The truth. You'll be a step mom, soon.
I was desperately waiting to give you this news.
And I'll see how you get jealous of my importance in Arham's life.
I can see that clearly right now.
Do you know? Whenever I saw you with Arham and the kids, I would wish.. If only..
I was in your place. And I didn't know when all my desires got fulfilled.
What happened? Aren't you happy?
To tell you the truth, this news is very shocking for me as well.
I was just acting to be dizzy and I never thought that act would turn out to be so fruitful.
People are right. Time waits for none.
Today I have the chance to be proud about the family you had until yesterday. 
 
You're absolutely right. Time waits for now.
If its with you today, it will be with me tomorrow. But the way you're turning Arham against me.
The day isn't far when you will lost this mask as well. 
 I haven't done anything yet.
Such small wishes and such big pride?
Don't do it.
Do you know what it is? When you have someone to fulfill your desires, it gets fulfilled, whether big or small.
And right now my biggest desire is to throw you out of Arham's life and this house.
Are you challenging me? 
 Not at all.
I'm warning you.
Use as much oppression as you can handle in the future.
Like a man belongs to none.. just like that..
even time doesn't belong to anyone. 
 Don't say that Sanaya.
If Arham scolded the kids, its because he's their father. What is my child's fault in it that you're cursing him?
What? 
 Sanaya?
Arham.. you'll not say anything to Sanaya's kid after today.
I don't want to bring up my child amidst her curses.
Sanaya I won't tolerate all this. You cannot curse my children.
She's lying. 
 Does everybody? She's lying.. mom used to lie. Only you tell the truth?
Stop it. Get tired. If I'm tolerating you in this house, its because of my kids.
Please, remember this.
Enough!
And you.. leave all this and drink this juice. The doctor has told you not to..
And I don't want to see you working around the house. And you're not following any of this nonsense.
Fabiha, we'll go out for dinner. I don't want to eat at home.
Can we go see mom, instead of dinner? I want to meet her.
I'm sure.. she'll forgive me if she hears this news.
Please..
Alright. If you want this.
Thank you. 
 You finish this juice please.
You're coming after such a long time. 
 Yes. I'm busy with work but I thought I'd go check on Hamza since he's unwell.
He's sick since morning and he doesn't want to go to the doctor. If you're here, tell him. He doesn't listen to me.
Okay. I'll see.
Farheen? You?
Hamza.. didn't I tell you to go to the doctor. But you didn't listen to me or Haniya.
What happened to the two of you? I'm not that sick.
You're behaving as if I'd die if I don't see a doctor. 
 God forbid.
If you don't speak good, don't say bad. 
 Alright. I'm sorry. Don't start like Fabiha.
Alright. If you don't want to see the doctor, eat something so that you can take your medicines. 
 Alright.
Alright. I'll leave now. I came to see you. 
 Wait..
Why are you leaving like this? I'll drop you. 
 Whats wrong with you? You're unwell. I'll go myself.
Whats wrong Farheen? I'm not so sick. I feel better. I'll drop you.
Alright. Will you change? I'll wait with Hania. 
 Yes. You sit with Hania. I'll change and come.
Alright. I'll wait in Hania's room.
Listen, hurry up. Its late. Mom must be waiting.
Alright. Sit with Hania. I'll change and come. 
 Alright.
I only had one reason to hide Arham's second marriage from you.
I was embarrassed.
But when you found out, why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide? 
 Because you'd been hurt, Sanaya.
When this has been written in my fate, why should I complain?
The man who promised me to keep me happy all my life, now he has backtracked on his promise.
I cannot complain to anyone. 
 Make yourself strong, Sanaya.
Ever since that woman came into my life, she's made my and my kids' life hell.
I don't understand what should I do? 
 You've never wanted bad for anyone. Nothing bad will happen to you Sanaya.
This is just a temporary problem and this too shall pass soon.
She had taken away Arham from me but now when she has a child..
I will lose my kids' father as well.
Hareem and Hadi idealize Arham.
When they see their father pampering someone else,
how will their minds be affected, I don't understand!
I'm scared.. how will I handle everything alone. 
 Why are you thinking like this, Sanaya?
I think you should give your relationship with Arham, some time.
And trust me, nobody can take the place of the first wife.
She has turned Arham against me so much that there is no place left.
I'm fed up of her antics..
Be strong Sanaya. I can understand that you're going through terrible times.
But the only solution is to not let these problems burden you. Even if there is no light, the darkness won't last for long
You should be strong.
How can I be strong? I cannot be strong Shehla.. what can I do? 
 You'll have to tolerate everything. Not for Arham but for your children.
I don't know how will my Fabiha be? Oh God..
Wherever my daughter is, keep her happy. You're the Lord.. please have mercy and keep my daughter happy.
Look at this Fabiha.. your childhood clothes. They're so cute. Whenever you have a child..
I'll make him wear this first. 
 Why are you doing this long term planning? First Farheen will have children and then I..
As God wills. I'll send you to your house with respect after you're married.
Mom, am I a burden to you that you keep talking about sending me away? I'll not come back if I leave.
I'll not come back if I leave.
Yes Fabiha.. you did what you said.
I'm going there but I don't know how mom will react. 
 Don't worry Fabiha. Aunty must have cooled down.
I don't think so Arham. What if she throws you out, along with me?
It will feel so bad. You'll be insulted because of me.
You sit in the car, I'll go and meet mom. 
 This won't happen. I'll go inside with you.
Whatever you've tolerated for me. I'll tolerate everything. Don't worry about me.
You can but I don't want anybody to say anything to you. No matter if its my mother.
Even if aunty slaps me angrily, I'll take that for you as well.
I told you.. I'm with you. 
 Thank you so much Arham. You're very nice. 
A little less than you. Now, smile..
Will you not come inside?
You go ahead..
Farheen are you back? You got late today. Did Hamza drop you?
Mom...
Mom.. listen to me..
Please sit.. I'll get you tea.. 
 No please. I don't take tea.
Oh yes. You drink coffee. I'll get you. Please sit.
Mom.. please talk to me once. What will ignoring get you? 
 Why are you here?
You already killed your respect.
Now do you want to kill your mother? 
 Mom.. its not that. I'm here to apologize.
I have nothing to give you.
Not even an apology.
Don't say this mom. Its been such a long time.
Please forget everything and forgive me.
I'm your daughter.. 
 You did a lot as my daughter..
There is an apology for mistakes, not sins..
Mom.. you're turning my mistake into a sin.
And I accept that I took a step against you but I didn't do anything that was prohibited.
But what you're doing is wrong for your daughter.
You fulfilled what Farheen wanted. What did you get out of it?
You made your heart bigger for her and forgave her. Why not for me then?
And as it is, I'm your son, mom.. 
 Don't emotionally blackmail me. Do you understand?
Please make mom understand.. Ask her to forgive me. 
 She's upset with you. You'll have to make up to her.
Mom, what was more important for you than my happiness?
Even you wanted me to be happy. See, I'm settled now.
I'm very happy with Arham. And I'm here to share my happiness with the two of you.
I'm here to tell you that you're going to be a grandma and Farheen, an aunt.
Isn't this good news enough to finish all misunderstandings?
I'm on the threshold of motherhood.
You're a mother, too.
Will you leave me alone in this hour?
Mothers support their daughters in this time. They stop them from the good and the bad.
Please don't blame this child for what I did.
Don't take away this relationship from him.
Forgive me.
Wounds don't heal.
And the person who wounds you, your heart is flooded with hatred for that person. Remember that.
I'm your daughter, mom. And which mom hates her children so much.
And which daughter buries their mother alive? The day you destroyed my respect..
I buried all my relations with you. You're nobody to me.
And whatever you did with Hamza..
Hamza.. Hamza.. Try and understand that Hamza's chapter is closed in my life, mom. I have Arham now..
Then leave with Arham. What are you doing here? 
 Mom, Arham is very nice.
He takes care of me. He loves me very much. I didn't have so many expectations from Hamza that I do have from Arham.
And, ever since he got this news, he has made it compulsory to fulfill all my wishes.
He fulfills all my wishes before I even speak. What more does a wife want from her husband?
You can make your husband dance to your tunes, not your mother.
Go. Leave! Right now.. Why are you wasting your time?
You're increasing my blood pressure. Leave! Leave!
Why isn't he answering the phone?
Who are you calling?
I'm calling Hamza. He wasn't well today but he insisted he'd drop me home.
Thats why I was just asking about him.
Alright, so he has become your driver and he gives you pick and drop?
By the way, how much does he earn by driving a cab everyday? 
 Its not a cab. Its his own car. The office gave him that.
The mart I work in, he's the sales manager.
Fabiha.. you very hasty in judging Hamza.
He lost you and reached her. Think about it. If you were with him, he'd have conquered the world.
Its his hard work that he has all this. And yes, his mother's prayers are with him.
No matter how much Hamza earns, he'll never be able to compete with Arham.
Oh well. I was here to meet you. I'll leave now. I'll come back some other time.
Lets go Arham. 
 Why?
I have nothing left here. Lets go. 
 Fabiha..
Bye..
Fabiha, fix your mood. Aunty will not mellow down in one go. She'll need time. We'll try and go again.
Thank you Arham. You're doing so much for me. 
 All this is nothing as compared to the happiness you're giving me.
Thank you. Now fix your mood. 
 Okay.
What is this? Now mom will scold you. You'll have fun then.
I did mine. 
 Whats happening here?
Nothing. I've completed all my questions. 
 Very good. Hadi show me what you're doing.
Bad manners Hareem. What did you do Hadi? You had to multiply. You added these.
Come here. Help your brother Hareem. See how mom is doing it? What is 2 multiplied by 3?
6.. 
 Yes. And 4 multiplied by 4 is equals to?
16. 
 Very good. Now you'll do the rest yourself and mom will check it.
What happened mom?
You seem worried.
Mom is absolutely fine. You complete your homework. 
 My homework is done. Can I color now?
Sure. 
 Mom, I'm done.
Show me. Very good. Now take out your other notebook. 
Mom.. Fabiha came but I was thinking what will Hamza think? 
 What will he think?
He'll hear whatever you tell him. Don't put anything else in his mind. 
 Whats wrong mom?
Why would I say something wrong to Hamza? I don't want him to get hurt. 
 Even I don't want him to be hurt.
But I want to make up for the pain my daughter caused him. 
 Hamza is a very noble man otherwise,
If Haris had been in his place, he'd have made a spectale out of our respect. 
 You should be grateful. 
If you had listened to your mother, you'd be spending a respectable life in your husband's house.
But no. You thought your mother was spewing poison at that time.
Mom.. I have apologized for my mistake a lot of times.
I know very well. If Fabiha comes here two three times, you'll forgive her. But no.. you'll never forget the mistakes I made.
You have always done this and you'll do this again. 
 Put it out of your mind that I'll forgive her if she apologizes.
Her mistake cannot be forgotten. Just like yours.
Mom.. I know you think I'm a burden.
But you'll get rid of this responsibility very soon. I'll not sit in your house all my life.
Your pain will go away very soon.
Farheen.. listen.. Tell me what you're thinking?
