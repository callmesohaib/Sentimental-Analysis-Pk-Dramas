[00:13] This is something to celebrate, let me feed this cake to Farheen.
[00:20] Many congratulations to you on your sister's birthday. Open your mouth.
[00:24] Open your mouth... come on...
[00:32] Are you afraid?
[00:35] Afraid of what?
Afraid of..
[00:40] losing me...
[00:43] I have full faith in my love and I'm proud of it as well.
[00:51] And I will never let this pride break.
[01:25] Mother you called?
Do you answer my bell everyday? Why would I call you?
[01:31] Where's Fabiha?
She's not here yet.
[01:37] She's very punctual, she's never late.
[01:41] Pick this phone up, let me ask her why she's late.
[01:45] It isn't time for her to arrive. There's nothing to worry about.
Should I worry about you if not her?
[01:56] Who takes care of me from morning till evening? She injects me with insulin in the morning and stays with till evening tea.
[02:05] You were never able to do that. You could never move past being my daughter-in-law.
[02:13] And she...
[02:15] But she became like my daughter in a few days
[02:20] Now go... why are you standing here? Are you not getting late for work?
[02:31] She can't do anything.
[04:26] Arhum what's the matter? Why didn't you go to work? Are you feeling well?
[04:30] Yes... it's just a little cough.
[04:39] You haven't eaten anything as well.
[04:41] No... I don't feel like it.
If you don't eat, you won't be able to have your medicine.
[04:47] Where's Shenaya?
[04:50] She went to work. She had a meeting
[04:54] My God!
[04:58] A meeting is more important to her than her husband
[05:02] It's not that good to be so irresponsible.
[05:05] She should have given you importance right now.
[05:11] But no...
[05:13] Her greed for money takes preference over her husband
[05:18] No mother, it's not like that. I was the one who asked to her to go.
Enough.
[05:23] There is no need for you to defend her.
[05:27] Fabiha... make him ginger and cinnamon tea.
[05:32] Sure...
You know I don't like it.
[05:34] You need it right now and you'll have to.
[05:37] Once you have your tea... and then I'll send you breakfast. Go and rest. If you need anything call me.
[05:47] Fabiha... just take a small piece of ginger.
[06:50] Sorry...
[06:53] Your tea.
[07:08] This is so bitter... please take it away.
[07:13] It is supposed to be a little bitter. If you don't drink it you'll stay like this for a week.
[07:19] Every bitter tasting thing has healing properties. You take medicine as well.
[07:24] Drink this, thinking that it is medicine.
[07:28] Alright.
[07:31] Fabiha...
[07:32] Send me your account details, it will be easier to give you your salary.
[07:40] I don't remember it.
[07:43] Alright fine, you can text me.
[07:52] I don't have your phone number.
[07:57] Write down my number.
[08:03] Why don't you save my number...
[08:08] Sure...
[08:12] Please tell me.
[08:20] Thank you.
[08:30] Every bitter tasting thing has healing properties. You take medicine as well. Drink this, thinking that it is medicine.
[08:48] I can't drink it.
[09:00] Tell me, did he drink his tea?
I gave it to him.
[09:05] You should have made him drink it in front of you.
[09:09] I'm telling you, ever since he was a kid he has a habit...
[09:13] Whenever he got sick, he never liked going to the doctor.
[09:17] Nor did he like any home remedy
[09:21] I thought that he would change after his marriage...
[09:26] but his wife was different. He won't drink it, I'm sure of it.
I have full faith that he will.
[09:37] Really..
[09:40] What have you told him?
[09:44] Somethings effect a person's heart and brain.
[09:48] I said something similar.
[09:52] Why are you so surprised about it?
[09:56] I was thinking what you did that Shenaya couldn't manage to do all this time.
[10:03] It's all about time.
[10:05] Sometimes we are unable to understand the person in front of us.
[10:09] Or that the person in front of us is unable to make us understand.
[10:13] But time makes us understand everything.
[10:17] You are very wise.
[11:07] Arhum, are you listening.
Yes.
[11:10] Yes Shenaya.
[11:17] What's the matter? Where is your attention?
[11:22] I was on the terrace to catch some fresh air.
[11:26] Okay... I have to know who took my husband's attention away from me
[11:33] Possessive... wow....
Of course.
[11:37] I am possessive over you.
[11:40] Anyways, forget this... I've taken the doctor's appointment. Be prepared at night. Bye.
[11:46] Okay bye.
[12:34] Greetings mother.
[12:36] You're here.
Mother...
[12:39] What's the matter?
Freshen up, I'll serve lunch.
[12:43] I've cooked and Somia used to make it everyday.
[12:48] Sit down...
[12:51] I promised that I will convince Somia to come back.
[12:55] Still you're worried. You know you get sick.
[13:00] What's the point in my living if I can't see my son happy?
Who told you that I'm unhappy?
[13:07] What are you saying?
My dear, you can stay happy without your mother.
[13:14] But a father cannot be happy without his daughter.
[13:19] I'm your mother, I know that very well.
[13:25] I just talked to Anayah in the morning. I talked to Somia as well.
[13:30] Everything will be alright in a few days, why are you worrying?
[13:35] Things are hard now, but it will pass. You know I need you, in good times and bad.
[13:42] Please be alright.
I'm with you my dear.
[13:46] Junaid, I'm with you, I always will be.
[13:51] I'll serve lunch.
[13:56] Mother... mother...
[14:00] Are you okay?
Wait a second.
[14:02] I don't know what's happening.
Mother...
[14:08] Did you take your blood pressure and sugar medcine in the morning?
I don't know.
[14:15] Sit down, I'll bring your medicine.
[14:19] My God... what's happening?
[14:24] I'll bring food.. wait a second.
[14:30] Do you know I have a function at my school tomorrow and I'll perform.
[14:36] Oh really and what are you going to perform?
I will end evil.
[14:41] Oh really... and...
And I will kill anyone who is our enemy.
[14:46] How?
[14:50] I feel afraid.
[14:52] Why are you afraid? You're not our enemy.
[14:56] That's true...
Will you come to see my performance?
[15:00] Who will stay with your granny if I come to see your performance?
If you don't come... I will be upset with you.
[15:09] Make him understand.
I'm sorry, he's upset at you, it's your job to cheer him up.
[15:17] Even if I come there what will I get?
Ice-cream...
[15:23] Yes... that too chocolate.
Alright done!
[15:30] You are very nice.
I know.
[15:33] I know...
[15:48] Yes Hamza?
I've been calling you for ages, where are you?
[15:51] Where can I be right now?
[15:54] I'm at the bus stop right now. The one I gave my bike to...
[16:00] I wanted to take my bike from him, but he's out of the city.
[16:03] He'll be back tomorrow and I'll start picking you up. Just manage today.
[16:09] The bus is here, I'll talk to you once I reach home.
[16:13] Farewell*
[16:29] Send me your account details, it will be easier to send you your salary.
[16:52] Where are you going?
I have a meeting with Faurkh, I need to give him some details.
[16:56] But we're going to the doctor, right?
No need, I'm fine... check it out.
[17:04] But I took an appointment.
Cancel it then.
[17:07] Ever since I drank some tea and applied some balm, I've been feeling better.
[17:12] You drank tea?
I know, it's better than any bitter medicine.
[17:17] Who made it for you?
Fabiha did.
[17:20] I'll see you in the evening.
[17:44] Did Hamza not come to pick you up today?
[17:47] I'm waiting for the bus. I'll leave once it's here.
[17:50] I'll drop you off...
No need, I'm used to it. Don't bother yourself.
[17:56] It's okay, I won't drop you daily. Please get in.
[18:14] Did you send money in my account?
[18:17] Yes I did.
[18:20] May I know the reason?
[18:23] Fabiha... I overheard you talking to mother.
[18:28] and it was mother's wish as well.
[18:31] And I thought it was better for me to help you, so I did.
[18:36] It was nice to see that there are still human beings in this world.
[18:41] But I cannot take this money from you.
[18:46] There is no need for you to do that.
[18:49] I know that someone who comes out of fear does not like going back to that place.
[18:57] That's why please... don't return this money. I'll deduct it from your salary.
[19:05] But...
No buts...please...
[19:10] Don't worry, I'm an honorable man, I don't need anything in return.
[19:21] Where?
Straight from here.
[19:55] Sometimes one is so compelled that it's very hard to refuse.
[20:01] Maybe that's the reason I couldn't refuse. But don't worry I'll return your money.
[20:07] You seem honorable.
[20:10] Just make sure...
[20:13] that you don't cry in front of mother.
[20:17] We've made you responsible for her.
[20:20] Just take care of her... and stay away from the kids.
[20:34] Brother, mother is calling you. 
[20:38] Is is something important? I'm sure you know... do tell me...
[20:44] I don't know...
[20:46] Don't act in front of me... tell me what it is.
[20:50] Auntie Shamsi called, she's coming next month.
[20:54] With Alishba.
[20:57] I came here to tell you this because we have to pick her clothes from the tailor.
[21:02] Why is she coming?
She's coming next month.
[21:07] Whether a disaster comes now or a month later, it's still a disaster.
[21:11] Should we ask sister Fabiha to ask Alishba...
[21:16] why she's coming.
Don't you dare say her name in front of Fabiha.
[21:23] Alishba is calling you... sorry Fabiha is...
[21:32] Hello...
Hamza, I wanted to talk about something important.
[21:36] Sure what is it?
[21:39] I arranged the money to payback Haroon, and I've sent him the money. Let him know.
[21:46] From where did you get the money?
[21:48] Arhum gave it to me, he'll cut it from my salary.
[21:52] Alright.
[22:03] Greetings*
How was your meeting?
[22:08] The meeting went fine and God willing, my promotion is almost guaranteed.
[22:13] Very good...
Arhum... I was thinking the loan you go approved...
[22:19] I was thinking of paying back my loan from it. To cut down the expenses.
[22:25] What do you say?
[22:29] Arhum... I'm talking to you.
[22:34] Can I pay my loan back with the money you got from your loan?
[22:39] Shenaya I forgot to tell you...
[22:43] What?
[22:46] That money...
[22:48] I gave to Fabiha. She was in trouble.
[22:51] What?
[22:53] What about our need?
[22:56] You didn't ask me once before giving her that money. You gave that amount, that too to a caretaker.
[23:02] It's good to help people. We'll cut it from her salary...
[23:06] We could have given her a few thousand if you wanted to help her...
[23:10] What need was there to give her money in lacs?
[23:14] We could have gotten so many things done using that money.
[23:18] You know you how much we've tolerated...
[23:22] for that money.
[23:26] Shenaya try to understand. Mother asked me, so I was bound to help her...
[23:33] Listen to me.... please 
[23:51] There's no need to worry, I'm an honorable man, I won't ask anything in return.
[23:58] Who was that?
Who?
[24:01] The one from whose car you got off of today, with hopes and dreams.
[24:09] These were your dreams right?
[24:14] A big bungalow... a car... money.
[24:19] But... there is no car here, nor anyone who owns a car.
[24:26] Sister, think before you speak.
[24:31] You are the one who seems lost in her thoughts.
[24:36] It's not how you think.
[24:38] He's someone's husband and a father to two. He came to drop me off just as a gesture.
[24:45] Gesture?
[24:48] Oh... but Fabiha...
[24:51] No one has ever showed you this gesture before.
[24:54] Sister please...
[24:57] I don't want to argue with your right now.
[25:00] Of course...
[25:02] Why would you talk to me now?
[25:05] But... your madam is very fortunate.
[25:10] She has a big house... a car... money and a handsome husband.
[25:19] I just read it on Facebook yesterday. All in one.
[25:24] And then there's Hamza.
[25:33] To tell you the truth, you can turn fortune in your favor.
[25:38] Learn to use your opportunities. It will fix your life.
[25:44] Fabiha...
[25:47] I'm sure you have his picture on Whatsapp...
What's the matter with you sister...
[25:51] I just want to see how he looks upfront.
[26:04] He's in even more handsome upfront.
[26:08] He doesn't seem like he has two kids.
[26:12] And... he dropped you off at home. So he has kind heart as well.
[26:18] Will you say anything?
Fabiha...
[26:21] When one's needs aren't met...
[26:26] then they become desires...
[26:30] Then one gets buried beneath those desires.
[26:36] Be careful.
[27:32] To tell you the truth, you can turn fortune in your favor.
[27:37] Learn to use your opportunities. It will fix your life.
[28:06] What's the matter?
[28:10] Uh...
[28:14] I've...
[28:18] returned Haroon his money.
[28:21] Who did you take it from?
[28:23] Hamza?
[28:25] He's Hamza, not the son of a minister.
[28:31] So... then who?
[28:36] Arhum's...
[28:38] mother.
[28:42] Arhum's mother.
[28:45] Alright.
[28:47] She seems like a nice woman.
[28:50] May God bless her for this.
[28:53] Amen.
[28:54] Mother, I'll get going...
[28:57] please don't try to fight with sister anymore.
[29:00] Don't worry, I won't.
I have to go.
[29:14] This is your sandwich... what will you have?
[29:17] Fried egg or omelet?
Whatever you want. I'll bring mother.
[29:23] Mother... can you feed me?
I cannot, I have a lot to do before work.
[29:29] I have to make omelet for your father. You sister is eating on her own.
[29:33] I promise, I'll feed you starting from tomorrow.
[29:36] Auntie Fabiha is here!
You look so nice!
[29:41] Will you come to my school?
I will try to.
[29:46] Fabiha is here as well.
Greetings*
[29:53] Get me some juice.
No, like everyday, your insulin comes first.
[29:59] Alright fine.
I'll be right back.
[30:02] Mom... what's the matter...
[30:05] You're in such a great mood ever since Fabiha arrived.
[30:09] Not only me, our entire house has changed ever since Fabiha came here.
[30:15] There is no reason to fight or argue.
[30:19] This girl has changed everything.
[30:30] If you needed money, then why didn't you ask  me?
[30:36] Why did you talk to mother?
You have it wrong, I didn't ask her for money... I was just..
[30:42] You were crying to get her sympathy and then you're saying that she offered you the money...
[30:49] There is a difference in a few thousand and a few lacs...
[30:53] I told you before... you should...
[30:58] only focus on what we hired you to do.
[31:02] Sure... sometimes one is so compelled...
[31:06] that it's hard to refuse.
[31:10] Maybe that's why I couldn't refuse. But don't worry, I'll return your money
[31:15] You seem honorable.
[31:19] Just take care...
[31:21] that this doesn't happen again.
[31:25] We've made you responsible for her...
[31:28] Just take care of her... stay away from the kids.
[31:43] You have a function at your school today...
[31:56] Come on Fabiha, why don't you have breakfast with us.
No, I already had it at home...
[32:05] Auntie Fabiha, will you come to my school?
How will she?
[32:10] Who will stay with granny if she does? Now finish your breakfast.
[32:15] It's not a big deal, it's only for a few hours.
[32:18] I managed to live alone before, when you went to work.
[32:23] Let the kids be happy.
[32:27] I'm running late for work, farewell mother.
Sure my dear.
[32:35] The school van is here.
Go ahead. Farewell*
[32:45] Hadi has invited you to school, you should surely go, otherwise the poor kid will be heart broken.
[32:51] Mine too.
[32:55] How will you go?
I'll catch a rickshaw.
[32:59] Why would you do that? I'll ask Arhum to pick you up.
No need to ask him.
[33:05] Come along, I'll bring your breakfast to you room.
That's sounds great.
[33:10] I'll have breakfast in my room.
[33:20] Come in.
[33:22] Hamza, have a seat.
[33:28] Hamza, pay attention to what I'm saying.
[33:32] Don't think that I'm criticizing Fabiha, there are certain things that I don't like about her.
[33:41] Like?
Asking mother for a loan.
[33:46] Being frank with my kids, the rest I expect you to understand.
[33:52] It would be better if things remain professional.
[33:56] I've talked to her, be sure to talk to her as well.
[34:01] Sure... I'll talk to her.
[34:05] I won't give you a chance to complain.
[34:09] Okay.
[34:24] Yes... Arhum I'm ready. I'm leaving.
[34:44] Don't use your other hand.
[34:53] What's the matter?
[34:55] You seem worried.
[34:59] No, it's nothing like that.
[35:01] Look at me.
[35:06] Did Shenaya say something?
[35:13] No.
[35:16] Will you hide things from me?
[35:19] I told you that you don't need to be afraid of anyone.
[35:23] It's not like I'll go and tell someone.
[35:29] You shouldn't have talked to Arhum about the money.
[35:40] So Shenaya told you off about that.
[35:44] Please don't say anything to anyone.
Please don't say anything to anyone. This job is important to me.
[35:49] If something happens this time, miss Shenaya will fire me.
[35:54] How can she do that? I'm telling you...
[35:58] no would dare fire you whilst I'm here. Get that through your head.
[36:05] But still, I don't want anything to happen because of me.
[36:10] Alright fine, don't worry. I'm just glad things got sorted out for you.
[36:14] Let her say whatever she wants.
[36:19] I will never forget this favor.
[36:23] I would be doing you a favor if you were a stranger, but you're family.
[36:28] You're going to visit the kids at school, right?
No... there is a lot to do at home. 
[36:34] Hadi is a kid, I'll be able to cheer him up.
What about me?
[36:40] What will you do if I get upset?
[36:43] Why would you get upset?
He's my grandson, his happiness means the world to me.
[36:52] And don't even bother worrying about Shenaya.
[36:56] Are you going there or not?
[37:00] Umm... I have a condition...
[37:04] What is that?
Give me your hand.
[37:10] And press this ten times...
[37:13] Ten?
Only then I'll go.
[37:16] Okay alright... I'll accept...
[37:29] Oh my God...
[38:31] Mother, I'll talk to you later. I have to go to Hadi's school. He has a performance today.
[38:49] Hello... hello.. mother... hello.
[38:54] Hello!
