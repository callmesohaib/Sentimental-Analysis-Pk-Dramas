[00:13] ok tell me, did you tell sister-in-law about mom's condition? 
[00:18] No
[00:19] Why? Call her, I am sure she will come immediately as soon as she will get to know about mom's health
[00:24]  call her, brother
[00:27] brother, please call her for my sake 
[00:29] As far as bringing you along is concerned, I thought maybe today you'd spend some time with your mother
[00:36] I would have stayed there if you hadn't come after getting upset 
[00:41] When people don't appreciate your presence, it's better for you to leave
[00:48] how can you think this way? 
[00:49] please Sanaya
[00:51]  I don't want to argue anymore
[00:59] what do you mean? 
[01:02] I mean, sometimes a person needs to change his/her time in order to change his/her fate
[01:11] and... sometimes she needs to change her man as well 
[01:14] be quiet, what rubbish you are talking?
[01:18] mom, I think soon both of you will become absolutely quiet
[01:25] oho! I am such a stupid. 
Aunty, Fabiha had told me, but I had completely forgotten
[01:32] actually I am habitual of picking her up daily, so I came
[01:36] anyways aunty, i am leaving. Bye
take care
[01:43] what was the need for you to discuss that man in front of Hamza?
[01:48] Mom, I've become habitual of speaking the truth while listening the truth about myself at all times
[01:52] that's why the truth had slipped from my mouth
[01:55] by the way, I am sure. Whatever story your dearest daughter had told you in the morning is all false
[02:01] and whatever Hamza had said to us right now, is also a lie
[02:05] I also know, that you won't say anything to your dearest daughter even after knowing everything
[02:11] because your household expense will be over
[02:14] don't talk rubbish, go soak it in water
[02:17] you only know how to talk!
[02:43] Fabiha aunty, I want to eat noodles today
[02:46] me too
[02:46] Coming... 
[02:49] but first we'll drink the milk full of calcium
[02:52] I don't want to drink
[02:53] hey, why you don't want to drink? 
You have to drink, come on
[03:01] hmm... if you won't drink milk then you won't get noodles as well
[03:06] No no, we are drinking
yes, we are
[03:08] good babies, come on finish it quickly
[03:12] let me bring noodles for you
[03:33] don't give flat bread to mom in lunch as her diabetics is high today
[03:36] and I have given her the insulin
[03:38] I've kept children clothes, make them go to sleep after feeding them the lunch
[03:41] Hadi's karate class is at 4:00 PM. Do remember to send him 
[03:44] and Arham's clothes are in the washing machine. Tell the maid to wash them & take it out
[04:13] have you checked all the designs, Hamza?
[04:16] yes maam, I have checked the designs you also review them once
[04:20] very good!
[04:22] what is this?
[04:30] one second
[04:37] hello! 
yes Fabiha?
[04:40] Fabiha, I forgot to give milk to the kids in the morning as I was running late
[04:44] do give it to them before lunch, its very important. Ok?
[04:57] don't worry, I have already fed milk to the kids
[05:01] thank you!
[05:02] You're such a great help
[05:07] the kids were telling me that you had gone to Hadi's function
[05:11] yes, the kids were insisting a lot that's why I had gone there. Otherwise, I wouldn't have gone there
[05:17] I understand, thank you!
[05:19] I don't have any problem with you, if you do your work while considering it as your work
[05:24] its just that, you have to be careful about every good & bad thing
[05:28] and Fabiha, if you have mind any of my words then don't take it to your heart. Ok?
[05:36] yes
[05:38] Okay, thank you!
[05:45] Hamza
[05:48] come in
[05:53] Alright, I have also checked these designs. So lock them
[05:58] okay
[06:02] yes yes, the plan is working 100%
[06:07] your arrow has stuck right on the point, Hadia
[06:12] are you doing the same as I had told you?
[06:15] yes yes, I am doing exactly the same.
[06:17] I send them off alone outside by making some excuse
[06:21] Sometimes I send them to the kids school, or hospital or for some coffee
[06:26] if not today but tomorrow they'll come near to each other
[06:29] you are doing an absolutely correct job
[06:31] its very important to make sister-in-law realize that she was wrong & we were right
[06:37] yes of-course
[06:39] my son is a man
[06:41] and a man's heart is way too big when it comes to a matter related to woman
[06:44] a woman's tears melts down a man so easily
[06:47] Mom, if we'll succeed in our motive
[06:52] then sister-in-law will get to know
[06:54] that what not she had lost to get something few
[07:05] She was so proud on her job
[07:09] now I will see
[07:11] whether she saves her husband or her job
[07:14] she had never left her job upon our orders though
[07:17] by the way, you are looking so fresh & healthy
[07:20] your lifestyle has completely changed after Fabiha's arrival, you are using Bluetooth
[07:26] Anyways, try to visit me. I will wait for you
[07:32] lets go, otherwise we'll be late. Be careful
[07:47] hello!
[07:48] thank God that you've picked up my call, otherwise I thought you might have flush me out of your life
[07:54] Shall we talk about important thing, Hamza?
[07:55] we shall discuss that but how, because you hide that from me
[08:02] what do you mean?
[08:03] I mean, if you had to take Arham's mother to the hospital then at least you could have informed me
[08:14] I forgot to tell you in a hurry, I am sorry
[08:17] Well, lets accept your sorry but... 
[08:21] there is one punishment for it
[08:23] and what is the punishment?
[08:24] the punishment is that, tonight you have to go on a dinner with me
[08:29] I've to go now, as aunty is calling me. I will talk to you later, Ok?
[08:33] Okay...
hey listen
[08:36] I want to say something to you
[08:37] yes
[08:39] I love you!
[08:43] Hamza, I will call you later
[08:46] Ok, bye!
[08:48] lets go
[09:01] how are you feeling now, mom?
[09:03] All thanks to God, its much better now
[09:06] you tell me, is everything fine?
[09:08] yes, everything is fine. You tell me, are you taking the medicines on time?
[09:11] yes yes...  medicines on time, food on time, sleep on time
[09:16] Somya is very disciplined
[09:18] its really good, and I am happy that everything is fine at your house
[09:23] thank God its better
[09:25] and look, you also take care not to say any such thing that either Arham or Somya shall mind
[09:33] yes mom
[09:34] and try to remove all the misunderstandings from Somya's heart
[09:39] its very important
[09:40] yes, take care. Bye!
[09:44] Bye!
[09:51] Done? Shall we go now?
wait, let me take tea
[09:54] lets go
[09:56] this is my favorite album
[09:59] lets see, whether you can guess the right answer or not.
Who is this?
[10:02] its Hadi
[10:03] Hadi?
No, its Arham, this is Arham as well
[10:08] until 3 years of age, Arham used to look exactly like Hadi
[10:12] seriously! Look at this, my dear Arham
[10:17] we had celebrated a very extravagant birthday when he was 5 years old
[10:21] my dear son
[10:25] He used to say, mom I will marry such a girl who will take very good care of you
[10:32] then he got Sanaya
[10:34] who is worried about her job
[10:37] and my son is worried about me
[10:44] only if I would have gotten a girl like you
[10:49] then it would have been really good
[10:55] right?
[11:00] hey... 
[11:01] I hope you haven't mind. I don't know what I had said. I just uttered whatever was there in my heart
[11:07] I haven't mind it, aunty
[11:10] and there is Sanaya, who minds all of my words
[11:16] its my off time, Hamza must be on his way
[11:18] yes, then make my tea & inject the insulin then you may leave
[11:22] Sanaya... mom
[11:25] Greetings!
[11:29] quickly have some sweets
[11:31] what's the matter, you are so happy. What happened?
[11:35] just eat this first
[11:38] but in what joy, at least tell me
[11:42] I got a promotion
[11:44] Thank God... All praise to God
[11:52] I will eat it at night after the insulin, but feed Fabiha as well
[12:05] please have
[12:06] eat it dear, why are you feeling shy from the sweets?
[12:13] Greetings mom!
[12:16] what's the matter, and in what joy you've brought the sweetmeats?
[12:20] your husband has been promoted
[12:23] really! Its such a good news
[12:29] congratulations!
[12:32] and along with this, today I will be taking all of you on the dinner specially
[12:37] what?
How will I go, you guys can go
[12:40] what is this, aren't you happy?
[12:43] why I wont be happy?
[12:45] I was saying this because who will take care of me over there? Sanaya will be troubled for no reason
[12:51] mom, I won't celebrate it without you & you now this very well
[12:55] Ok, lets do one thing
[12:57] lets take Fabiha along 
[13:01] there must be someone to take care of me over there, right Fabiha?
[13:19] yes, why not? I don't have any issue
[13:21] Fabiha, you are ok with it?
[13:24] what problem Fabiha would have?
[13:26] Ask Sanaya, if she doesn't have any objection
[13:42] No mom, what objection Sanaya would have?
[13:45] in fact, it will be helpful for you so its better
[13:53] yes, if Fabiha's family doesn't have any problem then she can come along with us
[13:58] why she won't get the permission?
Fabiha, make me speak to your mother
[14:01] she will agree upon my words
[14:03] but aunty, today I have plans with Hamza. I have to go with him
[14:07] You can make a plan with Hamza tomorrow once again, what's the big deal in it?
[14:10] but aunty... 
[14:13] alright then, I cannot go. You guy can continue with your plan
[14:19] what is this?
I won't go without you
[14:22] you can still celebrate it without me, but how will you manage it without Sanaya?
[14:26] and if I will go, then she will be in trouble by taking care of me
[14:30] let it be, you guys may go
[14:36] don't worry, I don't have an objection while coming along
[14:40] let me ask my mom once
[14:41] yes, at least talk to her. And if she doesn't agrees then make me speak to her
[14:46] I will convince her
Okay
[14:58] See... 
[15:01] girls are like her
[15:03] who are ready to leave their happiness for the sake of the happiness of others
[15:12] sometimes, its good to leave your happiness for others happiness
[15:29] that's why I like this girl a lot
[15:33] let me go change
[15:35] hmm... 
[15:41] hello! yes Fabiha, I am leaving from my house so I will reach to you within 10 minutes
[15:45] no no Hamza, wait a minute listen to me. Don't come
[15:49] why?
[15:50] what happened, Fabiha?
[15:52] Actually aunty is insisting a lot to accompany her for the dinner, so I couldn't refuse her
[15:58] Fabiha, you are making an excuse right?
[16:01] No Hamza, why would I make an excuse?
[16:03] actually aunty had insisted for the very first time so I couldn't refuse her. We can go tomorrow as well
[16:08] and for sure, you'll trap me in some excuse tomorrow as well
[16:13] don't you trust me?
[16:18] Fabiha, for now I am sure about your anger
[16:21] Hamza please, I am not upset with you
[16:25] I'm telling you that I will go with you tomorrow
[16:27] Ok fine, but I won't hear any excuse from you tomorrow
[16:32] you are going with me tomorrow, that's it!
[16:34] ok fine, I am going now. Bye!
Okay
[16:42] let me inform mom as well
[16:57] don't make a flat bread for Fabiha
[16:59] She is going on the dinner with Sanaya maam, so she'll come after having the dinner
[17:13] I already had a doubt that she had lied to make a false excuse in the morning
[17:17] and now, one more new excuse!
[17:19] I've seen a 9 to 5 job
[17:22] but mom, can you digest a job from 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM?
[17:28] today is an excuse for dinner, then tomorrow an excuse about health issues & then everyday a new excuse
[17:33] I have never seen such a job in my life, where a boss will come to drop her employee at home
[17:41] mom, do you remember the taunt you had given me?
[17:46] Dear, the beginning is from the excuses
[17:49] now see, your dearest daughter's excuses have started
[17:54] have you gone mad? What rubbish you are uttering?
[17:57] Rubbish? Mom, I am saying an absolute correct thing
[18:00] its just that you can ever tolerate to hear anything wrong about your dearest daughter
[18:05] otherwise, tell me one thing honestly
[18:06] whatever strictness you had done with me, why you haven't done that on Fabiha?
[18:10] why she is independent, because she earns money?
[18:13] I'm telling you, Mom, if you don't enforce all those strict rules on me, then you will be responsible for the consequences
[18:23] one needs to be a little strict for saving their respect
[18:27] and one has to bear a bit of strictness too
[19:39] thank you dear, thank you!
[19:42] Come, hey Fabiha how will you enter from here?
[19:46] go, sit there
[19:47] come on
[19:49] are you guys fine?
[19:52] what would you like to eat, mom?
[19:54] first ask Fabiha, what she would like to eat. Tell us Fabiha
[19:59] aunty, whatever is your choice
[20:01] everyone is telling their choice, so you tell us yours
[20:05] do order the same for me
[20:07] Chinese rice & something with it
[20:09] Okay
[20:11] granny, dad & Fabiha aunty's choice is the same
[20:14] Fabiha aunty will also eat dynamite chicken, right aunty?
[20:19] Sanaya, what do you want to eat?
[20:30] Sanaya?
[20:33] order grilled chicken for me
[20:36] and Fabiha you?
[20:38] dynamite chicken
[20:41] Okay
[20:42] yes, so what my kids would like to eat?
[20:45] dad, french fries with beef burger
[20:50] Wow! My tiger and you... 
[20:52] spaghetti...
very nice!
[20:55] Okay
[20:56] yes, have you note down the order?
[21:14] mom, actually I...
[21:19] I had told you not to come with this man
[21:22] don't you understand?
[21:25] you had lied to me in the morning as well
[21:27] Does Hamza know about your hospital visit or not?
[21:34] I am asking you, did you tell him or not?
No
[21:37] Okay, so you are lying & making your mother a fool
[22:02] Don't know why she is not attending the phone
[22:10] Everything changed after Fabiha's arrival, right?
[22:13] I mean, she has understood the kids very well
[22:18] obviously, she spends the entire day with us at home
[22:23] she takes very good care of me
[22:26] 've become so habitual of her that if I don't see her for one day, my entire day doesn't pass
[22:32] I've become so relieved after her arrival
[22:34] You'll see, even Hadia will feel so happy to meet you
[22:42] dad, I want to go to the play area
[22:45] we'll go there later, first have your dinner
[22:48] Dad, please let's go. Mom, please tell Dad to come with us
[22:54] Ok dear, Fabiha aunty will take you there. 
Fabiha, take the kids to the play area
[23:00] I?
[23:02] Yes, you!
go along with the kids and see the play area
[23:06] go
[23:07] lets go
[23:08] go, come on run
[23:10] be careful, don't hurt yourself. Ok?
[24:31] Arham, call the kids; otherwise, the food will get cold. We'll start once they are here
[24:35] yes mom
[24:36] please sit, let me call them
[24:37] No no, you start eating. Let me bring them
[24:48] where are you going?
[24:49] sit down, Arham has already gone
[24:56] learn to trust your husband...
[25:00] You won't be able to control him by following
[25:04] men is very bountiful
[25:08] And a woman's doubt makes him rebellious
[25:11] I'm telling you an important thing, keep it in your mind
[25:16] mom, I am your daughter-in-law
[25:20] your son's wife... why do you forget that?
[25:27] the way you forget that I am Arham's mother, the same way I forget that you...
[25:32] are Arham's wife
[25:38] Sanaya, your careless attitude has set me free from all the worries
[25:52] Mothers become happy in their sons' happiness, Mom
[25:55] isn't your sons' happiness dear to you?
[26:03] Happiness doesn't only mean money, Sanaya
[26:13] if we want to see someone happy
[26:15] then we have to give them time as well
[26:19] and you don't have it
[26:24] And if one wants to make their place in their husband's heart
[26:28] then that person had to take care of his mother
[26:31] understand?
[26:35] See...
[26:37] if you are talking about Arham's happiness, then I am sitting here for his happiness
[26:41] I hardly go anywhere though
[26:43] but I came here, for the sake of Arham's happiness
[26:50] by the way, you've said one thing absolutely correct Sanaya
[26:55] everything changed because of Fabiha's arrival
[27:02] hey come... be quick
[27:09] come on... come, your dinner is served
[27:13] come, start eating
[27:14] play area...
[27:17] how was it?
[27:18] very nice...
was it really nice?
[27:20] here you go. Come on start now
we are happy if the kids are happy
[27:37] hello!
[27:39] Greetings aunty!
[27:41] Greetings!
[27:43] Hamza, dear where are you?
[27:45] I am at home. Why, what happened? Is everything fine?
[27:49] yes, did you talk to Fabiha?
[27:52] yes aunty, I had a word with her. She said to me that she will call me back once she'll be free but...
[27:56] she didn't call me as of yet
[27:58] she is not receiving my phone as well
[28:01] Ok aunty don't worry, let me call her
[28:04] dear, do let me know I am waiting. Ok?
[28:07] Okay, I will let you know as soon as I talk to her
[28:10] Okay, bye!
[28:18] Fabiha, dear how will you go?
[28:20] aunty, by auto rickshaw
[28:22] No, how will go in the rickshaw so late night?
[28:25] Arham will drop you; he will go to drop you after dropping us at home
[28:29] yes mom
Okay
[28:31] Fabiha, call Hamza
[28:33] you can wait here until he comes to pick you
[28:36] yes
[28:48] Hamza is not attending the call, so let me take an auto rickshaw
[28:51] Arham, I am telling you that you will drop her
[28:55] you can drop her after dropping her, after all she is our responsibility
[28:58] I won't let the girl go alone in the rickshaw so late night
[29:01] Okay mom
yes
[29:16] so many calls!
[29:36] why she is not attending the call?
[29:51] thank you!
[29:52] for what?
[29:54] for dropping me home
[29:57] If you can take out some extra time for Mom for your job, then I can do this as well
[30:03] well, congratulations for your promotion
[30:06] thank you!
aunty was so happy today
[30:10] yesterday I was talking to Sanaya that since Fabiha came, mom's mood stays good. Also her health stays good
[30:18] She gets the medicines & insulin on time, everything is proper
[30:22] so thank you!
[30:23] don't embarrass me, aunty is just like my mother
[30:27] I really like to spend time with her, I don't know when the day passes
[30:31] Fabiha, if you don't mind then can I ask you a question?
[30:35] yes, please ask
[30:36] who else is there in your house, I mean brother... father
[30:40] my mother, my elder sister & I... the eldest son of the house
[30:43] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you
[30:45] hey, no no why are you saying sorry?
[30:49] Doesn't a woman have any life without a man?
[30:54] We can only say that not everyone can pay respect to everyone
[30:59] Otherwise, in this journey of my job, people had always tried to take advantage of me
[31:05] It's only you who have saved the respect of this girl while it was about to get tarnished
[31:10] thank you!
[31:12] If you ever need me in your life, then do let me know for sure
[31:16] I will be happy to help you
[31:19] Sure
[31:53] mom, actually I...
[31:58] I had told you not to come with this man
[32:01] don't you understand?
[32:04] you had lied to me in the morning as well
[32:06] Does Hamza know about your hospital visit or not?
[32:13] I am asking you, did you tell him or not?
No
[32:16] Okay, so you are lying & making your mother a fool
[32:21] and Hamza! in order to hide your lie, he kept a veil on it
[32:26] I am also so stupid, that I came into his words
[32:29] and gave you the permission to go for the dinner
[32:33] I wish... I wish, I would have done the job in your place
[32:38] Then at least I didn't have to die out of fear of losing the honor on a daily basis
[32:41] mom
[32:43] I did a very big mistake.
I had made a grave mistake
[32:47] by allowing you to do the job
[32:49] Mom, listen...
you've got me insulted in front of Hamza
[32:52] its not like that... 
you've got me humiliated
[32:55] its not like that mom, at least listen to me once
don't you dare!
[32:59] go...
[33:01] go away from my sight
[33:02] mom, at least listen to me once. There isn't any such thing as you are thinking
[33:05] get lost from here. Get lost!
[33:10] mom, compose yourself otherwise you'll get sick. Please sit
[33:14] this girl will tarnish my image
[33:16] she is a kid, gradually she will understand
[33:18] when she will understand? When?
[33:41] by the way, I got so tired today
[33:43] Fabiha's house is also very far
[33:47] hmm...
[33:50] what happened?
[33:52] I've noticed that you are very quiet today, also your mood was off at the restaurant too
[34:01] does it make any difference to you?
[34:07] it does, that's why I am asking
[34:09] tell me, what's the matter?
[34:11] I didn't like Fabiha's so much of involvement in our family
[34:17] the way mom was talking to her, taking care of her, asking her
[34:21] I felt so awkward
[34:25] after all, she is a caretaker
[34:28] she isn't our family member
[34:30] I felt as if mom wanted to tell us that she is our family member
[34:37] come on Sanaya, there isn't any such thing
[34:43] don't divert your thinking towards the wrong path by thinking like this
[34:47] the way you & I do the job, for our needs
[34:50] the same way, Fabiha is also our need at this time
[34:53] Ok tell me
[34:56] What was the need to ask her what she wants to eat?
[34:59] Whatever we were eating, she could have eaten the same
[35:03] what was the need for mom to ask her specially?
[35:07] What does Mom want to prove to me? What does she want to signify?
[35:10] nothing Sanaya
[35:13] she spends time with mom, takes care of her
[35:16] she takes care of the kids, she takes care of everyone
[35:19] She spends more time in this house than us
[35:22] so its all normal
[35:25] And she is not a bad girl; she is a nice girl who takes care of everyone
[35:30] you should be happy that your responsibilities are shared now
[35:33] she lives according to your orders, she does whatever you say to her
[35:37] what's the problem then?
[35:39] and why are you ruining your mood on this occasion?
[35:43] everything is so good, mom was also happy
[35:45] we have spent the time together after so many days
[35:49] come on, give me a smile
[35:57] thank you so much
[35:59] for supporting me
[36:06] Sanaya, wherever I am today its because of our hard work
[36:15] I wouldn't have been here if you hadn't supported me
[36:20] therefore, thank you!
[36:23] and I love you!
[36:26] I love you too
[36:42] wipe your tears
[36:53] here I am wiping your tears & you are showing me tantrums
[37:03] do you realize now?
[37:05] How hurt do you feel when another person slaps you, considering you wrong, even though you were right?
[37:12] Do you understand now how much I have suffered?
[37:16] I've been through so much pain
[37:21] sister, I had called Hamza so many times but he didn't answered even once.
[37:25] so, what is my fault in it?
[37:27] How could I have come alone at this hour of the night?
[37:29] I was compelled to come with Arham
[37:32] that's what I am trying to explain you, Fabiha
[37:35] when the time is against you, then nobody supports you
[37:39] look at me
[37:41] I had fought my battle all alone
[37:44] without any relation or love
[37:49] I have supported you in every step, sister.
[37:52] I did whatever you asked me to do
[37:54] For your sake, I got trapped in such a person's plan where I had to save my respect. What else could I have done?
[38:01] but Fabiha, I was completely alone
[38:05] mom doesn't listens to me at all
[38:10] I have done everything in my defence
[38:13] now its your turn
[38:15] according to you, you were standing with me but sorry to say
[38:20] right now, you are completely alone
[38:22] sister, a lonely person can go too far
[38:27] Neither does that person have the fear of getting separated from anyone
[38:30] Nor does that person have any hope from anyone
