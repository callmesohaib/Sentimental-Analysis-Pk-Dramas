[00:13] Sanaya, there is no point in apologizing. 
[00:16] You will raise questions again if anything will happen again. So, please let it be.
[00:20] I promise I won't raise any questions. 
[00:23] Promises are needed in those relations where there is no trust.
[00:27] So you should trust me to avoid such promises.
[00:30] Shouting only shows how a person's character is,
[00:33]  it doesn't show that he is right. Now it's enough.
[00:38] We can manage household expenses from Farheen's earning. You should think about your marriage. 
[00:42] Oh really?
[00:45] Then listen to me
[00:47] I am not going to marry Hamza.
[00:51] Please tell aunt Nasreen
[01:02] She is a woman and she can doubt anyone.
[01:05] Nothing as such will happen
[01:07]  you won't be accused
[01:09] I am not afraid if anything like that happens.
[01:11] Because I am sure that you won't allow any one to defame me
[01:16] A woman only needs love from her husband
[01:20] his time, which shall be only for her. That's it!
[01:47] whom are you calling?
[01:50] No one, actually I got a message from the bank
[01:54] Okay
[01:56] tell me, which shirt shall I press for tonight?
[01:58] blue one
[02:01] I had called Fabiha, she is also coming
[02:03] Kindly pick her up if she faces any problem in coming here
[02:06] Actually, we need to buy the fruits on our way, and mom cannot sit in the car for too long. That's why I was saying this
[02:12] okay
[02:15] Arham
[02:20] what's the matter?
[02:22] I've been noticing since last night that you are worried
[02:26] no, there isn't any such thing
[02:27] then why I am feeling so distanced from you?
[02:32] I said, there isn't any such thing you are just over-thinking
[02:42] Arham, I have never seen you in such a deep thought ever
[02:45] what's the matter?
[02:47] you know, I get worried whenever I get any message or call from the bank
[02:51] so Relax!
[02:52] and I always take you out of this tension
[02:56] why are you getting worried? I am here, I will pay the loan
[03:00] And Mister, you are forgetting that you are now promoted
[03:04] Now you can pay off your loan yourself
[03:07] come on, fix your mood now & give me a nice smile
[03:10] Okay?
[03:29] Even you didn't leave any chance to humiliate me at your in-laws' family.
[03:34] She is saying the right thing. Hamza has been on your side in every bad situation
[03:38] he had been the protector of your honor
[03:40] so what do you want? Do you want your daughter to help him by giving 10 lacs?
[03:42] What do you think? Do I work as a Minister? 
I haven't paid off the loan that I took for my sister as of yet
[03:47] but your Sanaya maam is on a good position, you should have asked her. She would have helped us a bit
[03:52] but no! Don't know in what thoughts you are lost. You are so lost!
[03:57] sister Nasreen is in such a bad condition while crying continuously
[03:59] it had to happen, after all he is her only son
[04:02] And if the money is not returned, then the punishment can be extended
[04:06] I think Hamza has gone to jail for a long time now
[04:08] be quiet! Whenever you speak, you utter wrong words only
[04:12] you can pray for something better as well
[04:14] and yes! why are you standing like an idol?
[04:17] go, call your sir Arham. He will help us
[04:21] He might have connections with influential people; he can get Hamza released
[04:25] go!
[04:26] What's wrong, Mom? What respect will be left of mine in front of them?
[04:29] i am not discussing anything with them
[04:30] Right now, the protector of your honor is in jail
[04:34] I am saying this to save your honor. Don't argue with me & go!
[04:39] no matter what you say, but I am not talking to them about anything
[04:42] really!
[04:43] Farheen, go call sir Arham from her phone & make me speak to him
[04:48] now go, get up!
[04:52] No, sister...
[04:59] sister
[05:00] what are you doing?
[05:01] I am calling, what else?
[05:02] don't!
[05:04] let him stay inside, I am getting rid of him with such a difficulty
[05:09] what are you saying, Fabiha. Are you mad?
[05:11] I am saying the right thing. Just think, I will be saved from marriage until he is inside the jail
[05:16] And how will Mom find out whether I spoke to Arham or not?
[05:21] Fabiha, I think you've gone mad
what if mom gets to know, then?
[05:25] so you are here, you will handle her
[05:34] hello!
[05:35] what happened, Fabiha?
[05:37] is everything fine, you sound anxious
[05:40] Actually, I was in the kitchen, and I came running to pick up the phone. That's why I am breathless
[05:46] are you sure?
[05:48] yes
[05:50] Okay, I will come to pick you by 6 PM. Be ready
[05:55] Okay
[05:58] bye!
[06:04] what was he saying?
[06:05] Actually, there is a dinner invitation at Sanaya Ma'am's parents' house, so I have to go with Auntie
[06:11] and you will go?
[06:12] Obviously, I will go. After all, I have to make new relations in order to forget the old ones
[06:17] Since I took a flight, I have to make my own way
[06:30] don't know in what condition my son must be
[06:33] nothing will happen, mom
brother will come back
[06:37] Hania, you don't know how merciless these policemen are
[06:42] don't know how they will treat my son
[06:45] The place where Sister Fabiha works, she is a manager at my brother's office
[06:50] She has talked to them, they are saying that he will be back soon
[06:54] do you have her number?
[06:56] no mom, I don't have the number
[07:01] She had called me once to discuss some matter related to Hamza
[07:05] check my phone log, her number might be there
[07:08] its such an old matter, mom
her number won't be there anymore
[07:11] Hania, at least check once
[07:15] okay, let me check
[07:19] If Hamza doesn't get bail today, then he has to stay in jail for the entire night
[07:26] and if he has to stay inside the jail
[07:30] then don't know how badly the policemen will treat him
[07:40] what happened, mom?
are you fine?
[07:44] mom
[07:44] yes, I am fine
[07:46] That's why I was telling you not to cry; you are getting sick from crying continuously
[07:50] oh God, what shall I do? My son is in such a big problem
[07:55] mom... 
[08:06] how am I looking?
[08:11] Selfish
[08:16] yesterday, you were selfish for brother Haris
[08:18] and today, I am for Arham
[08:22] today, I am realizing your feelings
[08:24] that the place you were yesterday, today I am standing on the same place
[08:27] Fabiha
[08:29] don't you think that you should support Hamza right now?
[08:34] sister, his fate is not supporting him then what will I do by supporting him?
[08:39] and nothing happens by a few days
[08:42] Let today's day pass, then I will talk to Arham
[08:47] and, will you handle mom if anything wrong happens?
[08:52] I will try
[08:55] bye!
[09:06] mom
[09:07] sir Arham is here, just pray. I am leaving
[09:12] Are you going to the police station or some dinner, getting so dressed up?
[09:16] mom, I am wearing such an old dress
[09:21] What is the need for you to go to the police station?
[09:28] I'll speak to Arham myself...
No no, mom.. 
[09:31] what's wrong with you? He is not our servant
[09:34] somebody needs to go along with him as a witness
[09:37] and he isn't Hamza's relative that he will get distressed for him
[09:40] So, I am leaving as he must be waiting
[10:17] Hello! yes Sanaya?
[10:20] Sanaya, I am about to reach
[10:21] Okay
[10:25] have you removed the band aid?
[10:27] yes, my hand is much better now
[10:31] By the way, you also get so uncomfortable every Sunday because of my mother
[10:36] no no, there isn't any such thing
[10:37] I like spending time with the kids & aunty
[10:44] what else do you like?
[10:47] Honestly speaking, I have never felt so comfortable anywhere ever
[10:50] I always did my job as a job, 9 to 5
[10:53] and here, it seems as its my duty
[10:56] sometimes, I feel as if its my own house
[11:01] I'm sorry, I am speaking just like that
[11:04] desires cannot change a person's status
[11:08] but prayers can
[11:10] prayers are very powerful
[11:33] go, sit in the car
[11:39] mom is waiting for you, go bring her
[11:43] be careful...
[11:46] lets go
[12:01] don't know where she must be wandering around 
[12:04] I don't have any of her update as of yet
[12:07] for now, Hamza is being tortured
[12:11] honestly speaking, for the first time in my life I am feeling sympathetic towards Hamza
[12:17] its every girl's desire to get a companion like Hamza
[12:22] who dance on her fingertips
[12:24] who considers her every word as the last word
[12:27] He not only insists on his own words but also listens to her
[12:30] but... Fabiha's attitude is sky high
[12:36] if someone else had been in Hamza's place & all this would have happened
[12:40] then don't know he would have left her long time ago
[12:44] Due to some good deeds, this relationship is still hanging in the balance
[12:51] Anyways leave it, call Fabiha & ask her where is she
[12:55] Did something happen or not? 
[12:56] Did she get Hamza released from jail, or is she doing an outing somewhere?
[13:00] call her
[13:01] do you think, Fabiha will be able to get Hamza released from the jail?
[13:05] yes, why not?
[13:07] even earlier, Arham had helped us
[13:11] I think even now he will give some assurance and get him bailed out
[13:15] but mom, if it didn't happen then?
[13:17] then I will feel so embarrassed in front of sister Nasreen
[13:21] I have given her so much of hope & assurance
[13:26] mom, that's why I am saying. if you say so then shall I try talking to my sir?
[13:34] does he have connections?
[13:36] that I don't know
[13:38] But let me ask, maybe he might do something
[13:42] Okay, ask him
[13:46] Okay
[13:56] my dear, my doll... 
[13:59] I felt so happy that you came to our house after forgetting all the past grievances
[14:05] I just came here because of her, because of Fabiha
[14:10] I had clearly told Arham that I will only go if Fabiha will go
[14:15] as Sanaya can hardly take care of my responsibility
[14:21] I can't see sister-in-law, where is she?
[14:23] She is inside the kitchen, working & checking on the dinner. Go
[14:28] let me go & help her
[14:34] you have such a good luck in this matter
[14:39] Even I had such a big desire that sometimes Hadia would also receive such a lavish dinner invitation, but...
[14:45] my daughter-in-law is hardly at home
[14:52] by the way, when is Hadia coming?
[14:55] she is coming next week. Since there is a wedding at her in-laws family, so she is coming to attend that
[15:00] do visit our house whenever Hadia comes
[15:04] yes yes, why not? If Sanaya will invite her sister-in-law with respect then why we won't come? We will come for sure
[15:11] By the way, now a dinner is due on us for your family. So tell me, when will you guys visit us?
[15:16] Good deeds and constantly asking about them. We'll come whenever you invite us
[15:20] It's decided then, we are having a grand dinner as soon as Hadia comes
[15:30] lets go Fabiha aunty, lets go upstairs in the garden to play. Please come, play
[15:38] please come
[15:39] go go, he feels like going & he won't go anywhere without you
[15:45] take him
[15:47] now see, he doesn't stay without her even for a second
[15:53] he has become so habitual of her
[15:57] Shama, what about the rice? Hurry up
[16:11] Everyone got together today after so many days
[16:14] And it's all possible because of you
[16:16] If you hadn't ended your anger, then all of us wouldn't have been together like this
[16:22] there is no use of digging the past
[16:25] its better to focus on the future, ok?
[16:30] okay by the way, shall I ask you something
[16:34] if you don't mind
[16:36] yes sister, go ahead
[16:38] since this girl is with aunty?
[16:42] Fabiha?
[16:44] sister, its not been a long time. Why?
[16:48] Strange!
[16:50] It hasn't been a long time, and the kids and aunty have become so accustomed to her
[16:56] don't you find it a bit weird?
[16:58] weird means?
[17:01] don't you think that she is taking your place, Sanaya?
[17:04] No sister, she is just an ordinary caretaker
[17:10] The way your kids have become accustomed to her, and aunty doesn't get tired of praising her
[17:16] I don't think her status as an ordinary one
[17:19] you shouldn't be giving her so much of freedom, Sanaya
[17:23] no sister, you are over-thinking. There isn't any such thing
[17:26] and Fabiha is a sensible & well-educated girl
[17:31] look, the word 'nobility' suits with a girls name
[17:35] but a man's nature isn't noble
[17:38] but opportunistic
[17:42] See, I am not your sister-in-law but I am explaining you as a sister
[17:48] its fine until the status of a caretaker
[17:51] But... I didn't find it appropriate to bring her into the dinner invites like this
[17:57] also mom was getting so worried, I tried explaining her but... 
[18:01] are you getting my point, what I am trying to tell you
[18:06] they are your kids, you should be with them
[18:11] you go for the job, & the kids are getting attached to her Sanaya
[18:15] If the kids become distant from you, then nobody else will be at fault but you
[18:22] are you getting what I am saying?
[18:26] you are thinking a lot uselessly, there isn't any such thing
[18:29] and I completely trust Arham
[18:32] don't worry, everything is fine. Ok?
[18:37] Ok tell me, let me help you
[18:39] you don't need to help at all. You will ruin your makeup, so go
[18:42] Ok, stay here & talk to me
[18:44] Shama... you haven't brought the rice as of yet
[18:47] all the crockery is here, let me take them to the table
[18:52] I had a word with Mr. Ajmal, and he said he will get Hamza bailed out
[18:56] really?
Thank God!
[19:00] Call Fabiha and ask her where she is, as she hasn't come back yet
[19:04] Okay
[19:17] mom, she is not picking up the phone
[19:20] call her again & keep calling until she picks up the phone
[19:23] and keep it on the speaker. Hurry up!
[19:52] caught you!
[19:55] this is your... 
[19:56] what are you doing?
Hey Fabiha... wait
[20:01] Fabiha, its your mother's call
[20:07] what?
Come, let me play with you
[20:09] Okay?
dad, catch us
[20:11] what happened, is everything okay?
[20:14] come on
[20:46] tell me what's there in your heart
[20:51] maybe these distances lessen
[21:01] will you agree?
[21:06] I?
[21:08] yes you, Fabiha
[21:20] brother look, please let me talk to my mother once. I will come back myself, I won't do anything
[21:27] I won't do anything forcefully
[21:30] I am not doing anything forcefully. Look, my mother is not well
[21:34] please give me the phone, I will do whatever you will ask me to do. Brother... 
[21:38] my mother is not well, please listen to me
[21:41] listen, wait. Brother please
[21:44] listen to me, please listen to me
[22:02] oh God, oh my Lord... 
[22:07] you are merciful, compassionate
[22:11] you are our helper and supporter
[22:14] oh God... 
[22:16] keep my Hamza in your protection
[22:19] oh my Lord... 
[22:22] oh my God, please ease our difficulties
[22:38] your prayers are answered, sister Farheen had called
[22:44] mom?
[22:46] mom, why are you sleeping here? Get up
[22:52] mom
[22:53] mom, get up. Let me take you inside
[23:03] No
[23:04] mom
[23:06] No! No... mom, please wake up. Let me take you inside
[23:10] please get up. mom... please get up
[23:14] mom... no
[23:17] no God no... please no. Mom!
[23:21] mom, please wake up. Mom
[23:25] mom, please wake up. See, brother is coming back
[23:28] mom, brother is coming back
[23:35] No... 
[23:37] mom
[23:39] mom, what shall I do?
[23:42] mom, what shall I do? please wake up
[23:55] hello!
[23:59] sister Farheen, mom is not talking to me
[24:02] she has gone quiet, I don't know
[24:05] please come..
[24:18] Somiya, where is Inaya & Hareem? I can't see them
[24:22] Both the madams requested to have dinner served in their rooms
[24:27] oh aunty, please take some
[24:28] yes yes, I am taking
Somya, serve aunty
[24:32] come on my dear, open your mouth
[24:33] No, I don't want to eat
[24:35] why my dear?
No, I want to eat a sandwich
[24:37] my dear, mom will make you a sandwich. Promise, Ok?
[24:39] No, I want to eat a sandwich
[24:41] you are my good son, right?
So don't annoy me, come on
[24:44] its okay, let me get some sandwiches for Hadi
[24:48] No, I want to eat sandwiches prepared by Fabiha aunty
[24:51] Hadi, your aunt is making a sandwich for you
[24:55] No no!
[24:57] Hadi!
Hadi?
[25:00] oh, he got upset
[25:05] these kids... let me check
[25:07] maam, please sit. Let me see. Please eat your dinner
[25:17] did you see
[25:19] these kids don't like anything without Fabiha
[25:35] mom, brother Hamza will come right away
[25:38] then you will wake up
[25:41] mom, see brother Hamza is here
[25:44] let me bring him
[25:52] see, mom is not saying anything
[25:54] what?
[25:54] yes, don't know what happened to her
[26:00] mom
[26:00] see, mom they are here. They will take you to the hospital
[26:05] you will be fine now
[26:06] Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return
[26:13] Call an ambulance
[26:17] sister, please tell her to wake up
[26:19] brother Hamza is coming
[26:30] come out
[26:32] you're free now
[26:35] hurry up!
[26:40] come quickly
[27:02] Shall I say something, if you don't mind?
[27:06] yes, go ahead
[27:09] I think, maam Sanaya's family didn't like my presence in their house
[27:15] whether anyone likes it or not
[27:18] but I liked it
[27:22] really!
[27:24] why, I shouldn't have liked it?
[27:28] what difference does it make if you like it, Arham?
[27:31] even I like something
[27:34] but I cannot get it
[27:39] why you cannot get it?
[27:41] because he is of someone else
[27:50] even I cannot get her
[27:55] why you cannot get her?
[28:01] because I am of someone else, and maybe
[28:05] she as well
[28:07] what if you want to become hers, then?
[28:13] one-sided love doesn't matters
[28:18] how can you be so sure that your love is one-sided?
[28:22] did you tell her?
[28:45] what duty are you guys doing?
[28:47] I am getting scolded by the SHO, because of you guys!
[28:56] yes, you've been bailed out for the next 15 days
[28:59] but return the money as soon as possible
[29:04] understand?
[29:08] pick up your things & leave
[29:23] and why are you guys looking at my face?
[29:25] you guys also leave
[29:55] Fabiha, why aren't you picking up the call?
[30:07] what's wrong, even Hania is not picking up the call
[30:32] No, I haven't told her
[30:34] then?
[30:38] She thinks that I am quite far from her reach
[30:41] is she really that far from your reach?
[30:49] tell me what's there in your heart
[30:54] maybe these distances lessen
[31:04] will you agree?
[31:09] I?
[31:11] yes you, Fabiha
[31:40] No...
Hania, please compose yourself
[31:42] So, her son proved to be a thief, though
[31:45] hey!
[31:46] Hania...
the embarrassment took away her life
[31:48] mom!
[31:48] you are absolutely correct
[31:50] may God have mercy.
brother...
[31:51] brother, mom...
bring me my mother
[31:55] bring my mother
[31:58] bring my mother
[32:02] have patience, please control yourself
[32:04] hey.. please control yourself
[32:07] I want my mother
[32:09] I want to talk to mom
[32:10] please compose yourself, Hania...
I want to talk to mom
[32:13] Hania, my dear please get a grip on yourself
[32:16] I want to talk to mom
[32:18] brother...
mom! I want to talk to mom
[32:23] I want to talk to mom
[32:42] what's the matter?
[32:43] sit here, I want to talk to you. Sit down
[32:46] what's the matter, mom?
[32:48] there is no happiness on your face by my arrival, you seem worried
[32:51] if mothers don't worry, then children can never make the right decisions
[32:58] do you think, I made a wrong decision?
[33:01] very big!
[33:04] why mom?
[33:07] a husband is a very big blessing
[33:10] cook food for him, decorate his house. Fulfill all the responsibility of a wife
[33:16] but we need to keep an eye on him as well
[33:20] And you! You've handover your husband to another woman yourself
[33:25] Oh mom...
[33:27] are you talking about Fabiha?
[33:30] Arham is my husband, and I never want him to look at another woman
[33:38] as far as Fabiha is concerned, then she a literate & well-educated girl
[33:42] I trust Arham more than Fabiha, mom
[33:46] So much of trust in a few days companionship?
[33:49] I am your mother, I will never want anything bad for you
[33:55] Arham is my life
[34:01] A wife gets to know first whatever action her husband takes
[34:11] you are worrying for no reason
[34:14] my daughter look, be very careful
[34:19] come on
[34:26] Fabiha
[34:28] Look, if you need anything, then call me without any hesitation
[34:34] listen
[34:38] Fabiha, I am in a strange situation. Whatever I had said to you in the car
[34:42] you had said whatever you wanted to
[34:45] but maybe you are forgetting that you are married
[34:49] I haven't forgotten
[34:51] I do remember that I am married, and I am fulfilling my marriage as well
[34:55] and I will keep fulfilling it
[34:58] I agree that I am weak but I am not impervious
[35:01] I cannot ruin any woman's marriage
[35:04] Fabiha, today life has put me in a strange situation
[35:13] my destination is in front of me but...
[35:18] there is no way to reach towards it
[35:23] I don't want you to get stuck
[35:26] therefore its better for you...
[35:28] to go back from here
[35:44] mom, what happened to aunt Nasreen?
[35:47] where were you?
[35:49] where were you!
[35:49] I...
[35:51] I was at the police station
[35:52] Hamza was in the jail
[35:54] and you are lying to me!
you are lying to me!
[35:57] There was a dinner at his wife's parents' house, and he wouldn't have helped me after extending his dinner invitation
[36:02] you also went to enjoy the dinner, right?
[36:05] why are you embarrassing me in front of Hamza?
[36:08] what will he think when he gets to know about it?
[36:12] Look, his mother lost her life while waiting for him. She died.
[36:19] A man, puts an allegation on someone within a few seconds
[36:24] Just pray that Hamza doesn't need to go through all of this
[36:26] otherwise, everything will be finished
[36:28] Mom, they have bought my time by giving me the money. Why don't you get it?
[36:33] I can understand your compulsion, but they won't
[36:36] if you want your daughter to spend her live according to your norms, then please let me return Haroon's money
[36:42] after that, your daughter will be free & this relation will be saved
[37:00] you took so long in coming back
[37:01] yes, actually... when we reached at Fabiha's house to drop her
[37:06] there we got to know about Hamza's mother
[37:09] she died
[37:10] then I went to drop Fabiha at his house
[37:14] Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return
[37:16] then I should also be going there
[37:18] the funeral time is not decided yet, Hamza has gone to the hospital. It will be confirmed by tomorrow
[37:25] are the kids asleep?
[37:26] yes
[37:28] When had Junaid dropped you?
[37:29] he had dropped me at 9 PM
[37:31] and do you know how stubborn Hadi has become!
[37:34] Although I had said no to him, he still insisted a lot that he wanted to eat an ice cream
[37:38] Sanaya, you know how much our son loves ice cream. Whenever we go out, he wishes for the same
[37:45] There is a lot of difference between expressing your desire and being stubborn, Arham
[37:51] he has become so stubborn that he wasn't listening to anyone
[37:55] what my brother must be thinking
[37:57] Usually, we are not with the kids, and they have become so stubborn while being with the caretaker
[38:01] Let Fabiha come, and I will ask her not to fulfill every desire of the kids, as they are becoming stubborn
[38:06] there is no need to fulfill their every desire
