[00:13] I love you very much Junaid....
[00:17] but that doesn't mean that I'll do what you ask of me.
[00:22] If you pressurize me then...
[00:26] I'll take Anayah and go to my mother. But...
[00:31] I will never apologize to Shenaya's mother-in=law.
[00:35] There is still time. Anyone in this world can get upset at us and it won't matter...
[00:40] but when one's husband is upset, it seems as though the entire world has turned against us.
[00:45] If mother leaves with me, then you'll lose your husband as well.
[00:56] Uncle, you can let mother know about this detail.
[01:00] Mother, talk to him.
[01:03] Hello, greetings brother.
[01:06] Yes I'm alright, how about you?
[01:11] Yes... no brother...
[01:14] I'm not upset at family. We're just compelled to be distant right now.
[01:20] Otherwise blood relationships remain, long after one is buried.
[01:25] Yes... Fareen told me that you want to call Haris to Muscat.
[01:32] Yes he does have a passport...
[01:36] Yes... he has passed his matriculation and...
[01:42] he knows how to do electrical maintenance. Yes he does have a passport.
[01:48] No brother...
[01:51] I don't know what the fees is for the via and ticket.
[01:55] How much will it be?
[02:01] Alright.
[02:03] Alright brother, I'll consider and call you back.
[02:09] Sure.
[02:11] Farewell.
[02:14] What did uncle say... when is he sending the visa?
[02:17] It's not like your uncle is the governer of Muscat, who'll sent the visa tomorrow morning, that too for free.
[02:22] He's asking for four lac rupees, for the visa, residence and ticket.
[02:28] And if he doesn't get a job then you can say a prayer for this relationship.
[02:32] Mother four lacs is not that huge an amount.
[02:36] Fabiha can take care of some of the amount... for the rest we have our jewelry.
[02:40] Mother, apply for the visa. Once we get the visa we'll manage to get the rest of the money.
[02:44] That's what I'm saying.
They are asking twenty five thousand for that, where will we get that from?
[02:53] Mother, I'll do something, don't worry.
Mother please... I beg you... wait for the visa.
[03:01] Please... mother I think you'll mess this up.
[03:05] What will I do? You're not fated to marry Haris.
[03:10] May God have mercy on me.
[03:32] You are the one who proclaimed your love.
[03:35] You promised to stay with me, listen to my needs and spend time with me.
[03:39] There were never any conditions...
[03:42] There were never any conditions.
[03:46] That is the difference between the love of a husband and a wife.
[03:53] For me, the love I have for you...
[03:57] is the peace for my soul.
[04:00] One can repay a loan any time... but in love...
[04:06] one has to sacrifice oneself.
[04:09] Alright fine.
[04:11] If I have to sacrifice my motherhood, just so that I can prove my love for you...
[04:16] then I swear on my child's life...
[04:20] Neither my mother, nor my sister-in-law said anything.
[04:25] Your mother was the one who cursed them.
[04:32] What did I do?
[04:39] What's the matter? You've taken such a trivial matter to heart.
[04:47] You've broken my pride today.
[04:51] I won't ever be able to trust you in life
[04:56] You refusal has strangled my love.
[05:01] Look Junaid... if I had to ask brother Arhum's forgiveness for Shenaya a thousand times...
[05:08] I would do so, but I will not apologize to Shenaya's mother-in-law.
[05:14] It's about a husband's right.
[05:18] It is a husband's right to make his wife listen to his decision.
[05:23] You stole this right from me.
[05:27] Fine then... then I don't have any right to live here!
[05:31] I'm leaving this house... you can save your sister's home!
[05:35] Anayah! Anayah!
[05:41] Mother, where are we going?
No more questions, wear your slippers, we're leaving.
[05:53] What's the matter? Where are you going?
Mother, I'm leaving this home.
[05:58] Have you gone mad? What's gotten into you?
[06:02] What else should I do? I cannot live in a place where I get punished for no reason.
[06:09] Don't take a hasty decision.
This is not a hasty decision.
[06:14] Because of your daughter, my husband is upset with me
[06:18] Who should I stay here for now?
[06:20] Granny, make mother understand. I don't want to leave.
Do as I say!
[06:26] Why are you scolding your child? You are not going anywhere, understand?
[06:32] Mother, listen to me... I don't want another allegation falling on my head.
[06:37] I have never refused anything you've said, please let me go.
My dear, I understand that you've never ignored anything that I've said...
[06:45] and I'm really proud of that. But you can't leave home like this.
[06:50] I order you not to leave this home...
[06:55] Do you understand? I can only make you understand as a mother.
[06:59] One shouldn't leave home like this.
[07:03] Come on... keep this back in. As far as Junaid is concerned...
[07:08] I will make him understand, he will listen to me.
[07:13] He's upset for the time being... now wind this up.
[07:19] My child is scared. I'm taking her to my room.
[07:46] Hello... I've been trying to reach brother Junaid for a while, he's not picking up.
[07:51] Why? Do you wish to say something to Junaid after talking to your mother?
[07:56] He does listen to everything you say...
[08:00] I'm sure he'll take me to apologize.
[08:04] No... it's not like that.
[08:08] Then what is it? Do you know for the first time in my life he left home without having breakfast.
[08:14] And I can't even tell you how rude he was to me.
[08:20] Do you know who the reason is for all this? It's you and your in-laws.
[08:26] And I will never forgive you for this.
I'm really sorry... I never wanted this.
[08:33] Brother can't be upset with you because of me. I'll make him understand.
[08:39] He cannot pressurize you like this...
But I've made to be look like a bad wife...
[08:45] No matter what you do now, I've made to be look like a bad wife because I didn't listen to his decision.
[08:50] What's the point of it now? I was the fool who was after your children....
[08:56] But I've decided now... whoever does bad to me, I will do bad to me.
[09:04] Sister listen to me...
[09:32] Listen to me... I'm sorry...
If I had know that our relationship was based on that...
[09:36] I would have sworn on my daughter's life there and then.
[09:41] Do you think apologizing will fix everything?
[09:45] Will that clear things with my brother and his wife? Will things be life it was before?
[09:49] I'll talk to mother, I'll make her understand... she'll agree.
Really...
[09:53] Do you think that she'll acknowledge her mistake if you ask her to?
[09:57] Will she think that my family is right?
I want things to stay inside our home.
[10:01] Things are not inside the house.
[10:04] It would have stayed inside this home, if it was not discussed outside.
[10:10] I don't understand why you always realize things after you've done them.
You know I'm emtional.
[10:16] I don't understand anything when I'm angry.
[10:19] Anger always harms oneself.
[10:23] The only way I'll be harmed is when you won't be with me.
[10:28] That's what I like about you. You always stand by my side.
[10:37] I promise...
[10:40] No matter how bad things get I won't leave you.
[10:48] I promise... please smile now.
[10:53] On one condition...
What condition?
[10:56] I want you to ask your mother to swear on your life and tell the truth.
[11:34] Make this as well.
[11:42] What's the matter? Why are you silent?
[11:46] It's nothing...
What does that mean?
[11:52] If you don't share things with me then who will you share it with? Tell me...
[11:58] How do you know that I'm worried?
I'm not just your driver...
[12:05] I love you a lot too... my heart is not dependent on your words.
[12:15] I can take one look and tell what's going inside of you.
[12:21] Tell me, otherwise I'll have to think of one or two more dialogues...
[12:25] I'm worried because of sister. Brother Haris has asked for four lac rupees to go to Muscat.
[12:31] I don't understand anything...
Look Fabiha...
[12:35] Try and make your sister understand. Talk to her...
[12:39] That guys is making your sister a fool.
[12:45] Even if he goes to Muscat...
[12:50] what will happen then? Do you think he'll take your sister with you?
[12:57] Sister is not willing to listen. We've left this decision to her.
[13:04] Please give it to us... I'm thirsty...
[13:07] Improve your mood and take this.
[13:25] This is my passport and this is my identity card. This is my mother's passport and identity card.
[13:32] And these are the rest of my documents. I pray that I get my visa quickly.
[13:39] Mother's passport?
[13:44] Sister, what are you saying?
[13:47] I'm an old woman, how will I live without my son? He's my only son.
[13:53] I've decided that I'll go with Haris...
[13:57] Besides... Fareen is here. She waited so long for Haris... and she can wait a little more...
[14:04] And yes... one day she'll live with Haris...
[14:10] Haris, I don't object you going abroad...
[14:15] But... taking care of so many needs without a job...
[14:20] how will you do it? Twenty five thousand is the fees for the visa. How will we get it?
[14:26] Auntie... God provides everything. I'm sure He'll create a way.
[14:32] Of course... why do you worry so much? Everything will be taken care of... don't worry.
[14:37] Fabiha is there... I'm sure she can do as much for her sister.
[14:43] I'm sure I can manage a few thousand rupees.
[14:49] My dear...
[14:51] A few thousand isn't enough to live life.
[14:58] Auntie... money isn't everything. It's here one day and gone the next.
[15:05] One shouldn't miss any opportunities...
[15:09] I've even thought of a way to spend my life.
[15:13] Really...
Farheen and I will earn and live in Muscat.
[15:20] Right Farheen?
[15:24] That's a great idea. You can earn and have fun.
[15:29] But if the two of you have to earn...
[15:32] then you guys can do it here in Pakistan. Why Muscat?
[15:42] That's a good question...
[15:45] I'm thinking of the future auntie.
[15:48] You don't know about Muscat... my friends have gone far ahead in life after going to Muscat.
[15:54] They've gone to London... Canada.. England...
[15:57] Thailand...
[16:06] Look..
[16:09] If you don't take life seriously now...
[16:12] then you'll wander life without achieving anything.
[16:18] Mother... please.
[16:21] Haris... have some tea.
[16:24] Some biscuits too.
[16:28] Auntie... you too...
Thank you my dear.
[16:32] Auntie... I've packed my bags... I'm ready...
[16:37] As soon as I get my visa, I'll leave Pakistan.
[16:42] But don't worry... I'll only leave after marrying Farheen.
[16:46] Don't worry...
You think quite a lot...
[16:50] But... my decision is something else...
[16:55] Farheen will not only be married...
[17:02] she'll be sent away as well.
[17:06] She'll go with you to Muscat.
[17:12] This is my decision, the rest is up to you.
[17:23] Why did you stop your hand?
[17:27] Please eat... your tea is getting cold.
[17:33] Eat...
[17:56] May I come inside?
[17:58] Come inside... you need not ask...
[18:09] What's the matter? You look quite worried.
[18:14] Yes...
[18:18] There is no need for you to worry whilst I'm here.
[18:23] Tell me... what can I do for you?
[18:29] The thing is that...
[18:33] Why are you so afraid?
[18:39] Tell me what it is... without any worries.
[18:44] I need four lac rupees... you can cut it from my salary.
[18:51] Four lac rupees... it's not that much but...
[18:56] may I ask why you need that amount?
[19:04] My sister's in-laws have put forth the condition that if they don't send their son to Muscat, then they won't let him marry my sister.
[19:11] And they will end the relationship.
So you're taking this money for your sister's happiness.
[19:18] Of course... what sister wouldn't?
[19:43] This is a check for four lac rupees...
[19:49] five...ten...fifteen...twenty...twenty-five...thirty...thirty five....forty...forty-five...
[19:59] this is fifty thousand as a wedding gift to your sister.
[20:04] I don't need the gift...
Please it's a gift, keep it.
[20:10] Please...
[20:14] Thank you...
You're welcome.
[20:18] Anything else...
No.. I'll get going.
[20:34] The bird has trapped itself in a cage.
[20:46] Mother, what's the matter? 
[20:51] Brother, call the ambulance... call the doctor... I'll take a look, you go and call the ambulance.
[20:57] Hadia, what is happening to her?!
Are you with the patient?
[21:02] Yes I am... what has happened to her?
She had a very serious attack.
[21:10] The next twenty four hours are very critical for her. Please pray.
[21:20] That's what I was trying to tell you. What need was there that to discuss that with Haris?
[21:24] That's what I've been trying to tell you for a while. I didn't say anything wrong.
[21:29] You said nothing wrong? First it was my in-laws with the conditions and now it's you.
[21:35] Mother, will my life will be lived on conditions.
Whatever decision I took is for your betterment.
[21:40] Don't think of your mother as your enemy. Now enough of that and do the dishes.
[21:45] I can do the dishes later, but what about you trying to wash away my life?
[21:49] Mother, you've made yourself an enemy by saying that. If you don't want Haris to go to Muscat, then you should have refused.
[21:55] Why did you make me your pawn?
You've sold your honor in gain of love.
[22:01] You are questioning your mother's love for him?
Mother...
[22:08] All my life I lived my life according to you, for once let me take my decision. I have no objections if Haris wants to leave after marrying me.
[22:16] You will remember my decision and the things I've said.
[22:22] But by then we won't be able to do anything, and you will have nothing left but tears.
[22:26] There will be no one to ask you apart from your mother.
[22:35] You can pray for my happiness, but you like to see tears in my eyes.
[22:40] Now I'm going to do the dishes.
[22:46] She's gone insane.
[22:48] Be careful... don't take out your anger on the dishes. You've broken them in the past.
[23:08] What's the matter mother? Will you keeping sitting like this, or will you say something?
[23:15] I heard it.
[23:21] Shenaya has put a condition in front of Arhum...
[23:25] What condition?
[23:29] That I...
[23:31] should swear on Arhum's life...
[23:35] and then say that Shenaya and her family are liars.
[23:40] Mother, it's not a big deal. Things like these don't matter. It's not like you'll mean it.
[23:46] Brother will ask you to do no such thing.
[23:51] You'll only get sick.
[23:55] If Arhum asks me?
[23:59] What if he asks me to swear on his life and say that Shenaya and her family are liars...
[24:07] then what Hadia...
[24:10] will I purge myself and swear falsely on my son's life?
[24:14] Then agree to it... swearing on his life won't change anything.
[24:22] Remove these doubts from your heart. If you want you will imposed on this house, then make yourself strong.
[24:30] Did you take your insulin? No, right? I'll be right back with it, alongside breakfast.
[24:35] I'm worried about my son's life and you're worried about insulin.
[24:41] You don't understand what I'm saying.
[24:44] Stupid girl.
[24:56] Morning everyone.
[25:03] How are you all? I hope you guys are well.
[25:06] There is a reason I've called this meeting today...
[25:10] For so many years promotions have been pending for all of you.
[25:15] Now it's time to announce your promotions.
[25:22] I have the progress reports in front of you. On the basis of that we've decided promotions for all of you.
[25:29] Mr. Javed, from now you'll be the new chief executive.
[25:37] Miss Sofia, you'll be overtaking the finance department from now on...
[25:42] Thank you...
The efforts that miss Shenaya has put into our Dubai project...
[25:48] is amazing... and I give miss Shenaya all the credit.
[25:53] Thank you sir...
The promotion list for all of you has been sent to the head of department...
[25:58] and the last promotion for today is...
[26:04] Miss Shenaya, alongside the design department, you'll be overlooking the marketing department as well.
[26:10] Congratulations!
[26:14] Thank you sir... thank you so much.
[26:19] Congratulations ma'am.
I'm hopeful that you'll continue working this way.
[26:24] Sure sir... and thank you for trusting me.
[26:52] Arhum will be so happy once he finds out.
[27:03] Come on... pick up the phone.
[27:14] If you keep pacing like this, it will only increase your blood pressure.
[27:19] He'll be here any moment now and I have no answer to his questions.
[27:25] There is no need for you to answer his questions. I've been trying to tell you that for a while now.
[27:33] It's not that big a deal... you can say anything.
[27:38] Do you want some water?
[27:42] What if he asks...
[27:43] why we haven't left for Dubai.
You can tell him that we had the flight canceled.
[27:52] What if she asks about Shenaya?
Mother...
[27:56] Arhum... come in...
[28:00] Greetings.
[28:03] I thought you had your flight?
[28:05] Mother wasn't feeling well, so I canceled it. Her bloods pressure was high, I gave her medicine, she'll be alright soon.
[28:18] How are you feeling now?
[28:21] I'm well.
[28:24] I wanted to talk to you about something important.
[28:29] Sure... what is it?
[28:42] Look, don't take it the wrong way... I don't want to upset you...
[28:54] Just swore on my life and tell me that you didn't curse sister Somia's daughter.
[29:01] For me, please.
[29:04] I know you didn't do it. You're my mother... and I know you could never do that.
[29:10] I don't know why... just once, swear on my life.
[29:23] Mother...
[29:39] Mother, what happened?
Mother...
[29:44] Call the ambulance... call the doctor...
Mother, open you eyes!
[29:50] Mother...
Hadia, what's happening to her?
[29:55] Mother... everything is fine now...
[29:59] Mother... mother...
[30:03] Mother... mother...
[30:06] Brother!
[30:35] Yes doctor...
Are you with the patient?
[30:37] Yes... what has happened to my mother?
[30:40] She has had a serious attack.
[30:45] The next twenty four hours are very critical for her. Please pray for her.
[31:01] Are you happy now?
[31:05] Are you at peace bringing our mother to this point?
[31:12] I can't believe that you compare you wife to your mother.
[31:21] That you can question her on your wife's say so.
[31:27] You did this because sister-in-law asked you, right?
[31:30] Huh?
[31:32] If something were to happen to her, have you ever thought how you would bury your mother with this guilt?
[31:39] You angry right now... and one can't control their words and actions when one is angry.
[31:45] Mother needs our prayers right now, not this.
[31:51] If...
[31:53] If anything happens to my mother...
[31:59] I will not forgive you or your wife.
[32:34] Shenaya is calling at this hour?
[32:38] Hello...
Greetings mother.
[32:41] Is everything alright my dear?
[32:43] You sound worried... is everything alright?
[32:48] Mother is not well... she's in the hospital... the next twenty four hours are very critical.
[32:55] May God have mercy... what happened?
[33:02] Don't worry... God will make everything alright. Be Arhum's strength right now... he needs you the most right now.
[33:10] Forget everything my dear.
[33:13] You being upset doesn't matter when it comes to relationships...
[33:19] Take care of yourself and don't worry.
[33:25] If every mother is life... then no woman would have a troubled household.
[33:29] Where are you right now?
[33:32] I'm at home with the kids. Arhum and Hadia are at the hospital alone.
[33:37] Mother can't you come here with brother to stay with the kids...
[33:42] so that I can go to the hospital. I'm sure Arhum must be feeling alone right now.
[33:47] Don't worry at all... I'll send Junaid right away.
[33:53] Thank you mother.
Farewell*
[34:22] What are you doing up? Don't you have to go in the morning?
[34:28] I have to...
[34:35] I came to give this to you.
[34:40] What is this?
[34:43] Four lac rupees.
How can someone give you such a hefty amount?
[34:50] I took it from my employer.
[34:53] Such a big amount. How can he give this to you?
[34:58] Maybe because he was sympathetic.
[35:01] Sympathy? For what?
[35:04] One can only be sympathetic to a lonely woman.
[35:09] You shouldn't have taken a favor like this from someone.
[35:14] You shouldn't have told him about your problems.
[35:19] Men know how to take advantage of compulsions. We could have taken a loan from the bank.
[35:25] And returned eight lac rupees?
[35:31] Like our life... it's not easy to take a loan from the bank.
[35:35] God took us so far... I'm sure he'll take us the rest of the way.
[35:40] Don't worry... apply for brother Haris's visa.
[35:46] Alright... fine.
[35:49] You can have it cut from your salary. But we'll have to cut down on our rations.
[35:58] Now take your medicine.
[36:01] Don't worry.
[36:43] Are you still upset?
[36:46] Does it make a difference to you if I am?
[36:49] Why? Do you think you being upset makes no difference to me?
[36:54] No... because if it did...
[36:57] Then you wouldn't have hurt my heart this way.
[37:02] Then how will this heart mend?
[37:05] Why are you being so romantic now? Who asked you to?
[37:10] I don't need someone else to tell me to be romantic with my wife.
[37:15] Then why does your sister become cause for you to hate your wife?
[37:23] Yes mother... is everything alright?
Shenaya just called... it's not good news..
[37:28] Shenaya's mother-in-law is in a bad condition. She's in the ICU and she had a stroke...
[37:34] Drop me off at Shenaya's home with the kids and take Shenaya to the hospital.
[37:38] Arhum is alone...
Let's go.. where are my keys?
[37:43] Mother... I'll come along as well.
Hurry up.
[37:56] Have some water.
[37:59] I won't eat or drink anything until mother wakes up.
[38:05] Mother will be fine... have some faith in God and eat something.
[38:09] I trusted you didn't I...
[38:15] And look what you did to my mother.
Control yourself, this is the hospital.
[38:22] Arhum... how's mother feeling now... what are the doctors saying...
[38:28] The doctors haven't provided us with any hope.
[38:37] Nothing will happen to her, don't worry.
[38:41] I'm here with you, don't worry.
[38:48] Arhum...
[38:50] Be strong, everything will be alright.
[39:02] I made a mistake.
[39:06] My mother raised me without my father and I tested my mother with what the truth was.
[39:13] Don't hold yourself responsible. No one can fight with fate... not even time.
[39:22] Everything will be alright.
[39:27] Hadia...
[39:29] Don't worry... auntie will be fine.
I don't need your sympathies...
