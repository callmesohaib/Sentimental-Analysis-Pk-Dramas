[01:13] After Haris left...
[01:16] if there was someone who was there for me, then that was you.
[01:25] And I started liking you. I started realizing your pain, even more than you.
[01:37] I thought that I...
[01:41] I could replace Fabiha for you.
This is not the time to fight Arhum.
[01:45] Where are my kids? Find them! Where are they!
They are my kids as well. I'll find them.
[01:52] I made you responsible, why did you ask her?
Hareem was your responsibility...
[01:58] I want my kids...
Did you ask the school?
[02:03] I did, but they don't know.
We need to file a report with the police.
[02:07] Yes, you're right. I should head to the police station.
[02:35] This happened and you didn't even tell me.
[02:39] What are you talking about?
That sister Farheen wants to marry you.
[02:49] And I know you that much... you only refused because you're afraid of Fabiha.
[02:54] Right?
[03:00] Was she afraid of being disloyal to you.
[03:06] Then why are you afraid of her whilst taking the biggest decision of your life.
[03:14] To tell you the truth I do not object sister Farheen.
[03:19] Hania, I don't want to talk about this.
Why not? I want to know.
[03:25] I told you that I don't want to talk about it, don't be stubborn.
[03:28] Alright fine, don't worry sister Farheen if you don't want to.
[03:36] Marry my friend's sister then.
[03:41] So that I may be at peace that my brother has forgotten Fabiha.
[03:48] If you want to marry someone then why not sister Farheen?
[03:55] One should choose a path where he is certain of his companion.
[04:02] Someone who will not betray you or left you stranded, like Fabiha did.
[04:11] It's foolish to run after her. Something that you've been doing up till now.
[04:20] Sister Farheen wants to take care of someone who can't even take care of himself.
[04:30] Sister Farheen was right when she said that you have to decided who you will put in sister Farheen's place.
[04:40] Is it sister Farheen or someone else?
[05:34] Where are the kids Arhum?
[05:37] Where are the kids Arhum?
[05:39] I couldn't find the kids.
You couldn't find them?
[05:42] You promised me that you would bring the kids home.
[05:45] I just talked to the inspector, he assured me that he will find the kids till morning.
[05:49] What will we do until then? Shall we do nothing? I wonder how my kids must be... I wonder if they ate something.
[05:56] Pray that both of them are together, don't worry. We'll find them soon.
[06:02] We're trying... what can we do sitting at home?
[06:06] Shall we wait for the kids....
Sister my kids...
[06:13] I want my kids...
Junaid said that we would find them. Don't worry.
[06:17] Shenaya, don't lose strength...
[06:20] How can I not lose strength? I want my kids.... where are they? I'll die if I don't find my kids.
[06:27] I'm trying...
[06:33] All of this happened because of her...
What are you doing?
[06:37] Ever since she's come in my life she has ruined it! First she stole my husband and now my kids!
[06:44] I might have compromised on my husband, but if something happens to my kids...
[06:48] then I will kill you!
Your kids were your responsibility...not mine!
[06:53] Shut up!
Fabiha...
[06:55] What?
[06:59] If I took care of the kids it was because I loved you.
[07:04] The kids were her mother's responsibility, not mine!
[07:10] This is what should happen to women like you. She couldn't take care of her husband and her kids!
[07:15] I didn't expect this from you.
[07:19] If you had picked the kids up on time, they would have been here right now.
[07:24] Go upstairs!
[07:28] Go!
[07:30] I don't know... Arhum find my kids... I can't live without them.
Trust me..
[07:39] I'm trying.
Brother, do something
[07:43] Yes... inspector...
[07:47] Yes, I'll be right over...
What did he say?
[07:50] He's called me over...
Listen to me...
[07:53] We need to paste some folders around the city. I'll make some social media posts as well. I'll mention it in my groups as well.
[08:01] Alright? Come with me...
Let's go... sister please take care of her.
[08:05] I'll come with you...
Shenaya stay here with me...
[12:55] Farheen... the tea has been boiling for a while now... are you in your senses?
[13:01] Mother, it's not boiling... you told me that you liked cooked tea.
I did say that, but that doesn't mean I like burnt tea.
[13:09] Forget about that... tell me...
[13:13] Did you visit Hamza? What did Hania say?
[13:19] Nothing mother, she called me because she wanted to pack some stuff.
[13:26] She wanted to go to the market for some clothes.
Did you meet Hamza?
[13:33] No... I did not.
I feel as though...
[13:38] he didn't take what you said seriously...
[13:44] I was thinking of calling him here and apologizing.
[13:52] What if we lose our relationship in all this.
[14:00] Whatever you think is right.
[14:24] Farheen...
[14:27] Mother.
[14:29] Why does this always happen to me?
[14:35] Why am I always deprived of happiness? Why am I being tested so much?
[14:42] I'm tired mother...
[14:46] God willing everything will be better.
[14:50] Pray to God... don't cry.
[16:57] How are you?
I'm well my dear.
[16:59] Is everything alright? Why are you guys here?
Can't we come here without a reason?
[17:05] No my dear... I didn't mean it that way.
[17:09] Now that you're here, eat before you leave.
[17:14] To tell you the truth, you'll have to be our host. After all we are from the family of the groom.
[17:20] What do you mean?
[17:23] What do you think? What if we marry my brother to sister Farheen?
[17:29] Huh? What is she saying Hamza?
[17:35] Hania is right. I want to marry Farheen..
[17:40] if you don't have any objections.
[17:52] We'll do it this week and there is no option for you to refuse.
[18:24] It was hard for me to convince my brother, and you are now indebted to me.
[18:30] Hania... has Hamza really agreed?
Yes he has!
[18:36] I can't believe it!
You two are getting married this week.
[18:42] Just don't go insane.
I think I really will go insane.
[18:47] What can I do?
[18:50] You have to take care of my brother.
[18:55] Sit down, I'll bring tea.
[19:13] I'm very tired sister... I can't walk anymore.
You remember what the uncle said, just a little further.
[19:22] Sister I'm starving.
We can only eat once we reach there.
[19:29] Nothing is present here to eat.
[19:33] I have a sandwich in my bag, sit here.
[19:41] I'll give it to you right away.
[19:49] Here is your sandwich.
[19:55] Here you are.
[20:00] Hurry up...
Do you want some sister?
[20:03] No Hadi, I'm stuffed.
[20:06] Hurry up, we have to leave as well. Come on eat...
[20:13] I'm stuffed... keep this inside, let's go.
[20:18] Alright fine... let me close this.
[20:24] This is not closing.
[20:26] It's closed... let's go now.
[20:35] Come on.
[20:38] We've set the wedding date, but got nothing sweet.
[20:42] The groom's family are the ones who bring the sweetmeats...
I know, but we were so happy that we forgot.
[20:53] It's alright, I'll bring some once I'm done eating.
[21:02] That's great.
[21:30] Sister, let's go home... I'm very tired...
[21:35] Think about it... you'll have to live with father, and I'll have to live with mother...
[21:40] At least at an orphanage we can live together...
[21:44] Shall we go there then?
That's what I've been saying.
[21:52] I trusted you by marrying you, I relied on you.
[22:01] Curse the time when I decided to marry you.
[22:11] You think we lost Hadi because of you.
If you had picked him up from school on time, he'd be with us today.
[22:17] It's not like Shenaya reached the school on time.
[22:23] It's her own kids and she didn't care, then why should I?
They were my kids as well... you could have cared....
[22:32] I trusted you by marrying you, I relied on you.
[22:40] Curse the time when I decided to marry you.
[22:48] Great going!
[22:53] I was the destroyed your home... I was the one who lost your kids...
[22:59] I was the one who distanced you from Shenaya. I was the one who stole the rights of your children. What about what Shenaya did to you?
[23:10] A few days ago you blamed Shenaya for everything and now you're standing by her.
[23:20] A woman is to blame for everything. A women is always wrong.
[23:27] It's very easy to hand over the responsibilities to a woman and then blame her for the shortcomings.
[23:33] But tell me one thing... if a man marries for the second, then so does the woman... it is with the same desire...
[23:40] Still why does the man act so dumb? Answer me!
[23:46] A man tolerates everything to defend his second marriage.
[23:53] But when it comes to the shortcoming, he blames the woman. Answer me why?
[24:02] You blamed me for everything.
[24:09] It's not like you did anything wrong. You have no fault in this.
[24:19] You're right.
[24:30] It's not your fault, it's mine.
[24:34] Mine.
[24:41] I realize it now.
[24:49] Arhum.
[25:40] What did you do?
[26:09] Junaid has gone to the inspector...
[26:12] Hope for the best.
How will I live without my children?
[26:17] I'll die... how will I live without the kids?
[26:22] I learned to live without Arhum, what will I do without the kids?
Don't worry Shenaya, we'll find the kids.
[26:29] Junaid and brother Arhum are at it... we'll find the kids.
[26:33] Pray for them... a mother's prayer are immediately accepted.
[26:40] Pray for them...
Happiness has been stripped away from me.
[26:46] Ever since Fabiha stepped inside this house... I've been tolerating everything.
[26:52] I have strangled my right, but how can I strangle my motherhood?
[26:59] Hope for the best... God protect my kids.
[27:07] I wonder where my kids must be.
[27:10] What should I do?
[27:41] Hadi... Hadi... Hadi...
[29:20] Sister, are you okay?
No, I'm completely fine.
[29:39] Where is your home?
[30:05] Who are you two with?
Get out of our way... let us go...
[30:12] I should let you go?
[30:16] Where do you want to go?
We want to go to an orphanage... could you take us?
[30:20] Sure, I can take you there.
[30:24] I know where to go...
Let's go with him.
[30:30] You don't know the way... let's go with him!
[30:37] Enough! I've been with you since morning!
[30:41] I can take you there... did you eat?
[30:48] Let us go... we've eaten...
[30:53] Get out of our way...
I'll give you chocolates... I'll take you to your parents as well.
[31:13] So what if Hadi isn't here.... I'll play with you
[31:17] I want to play with father and Hadi...
[31:28] I want father to feed me.
[31:31] Like uncle was feeding Anayah.
[31:38] Mother, I'm father's princess, right?
[31:48] So what if father isn't here. I'll feed you
I don't want to mother.
[31:59] I want to be fed by you and father!
[32:25] What happened? Why are you crying?
I'm thinking of how long I'll have to be away from you.
[33:05] Why are you so afraid, are you hiding something from me?
[33:08] No... 
[33:11] Don't hide anything from me... tell me what happened.
[33:17] I didn't play any video game yesterday, still auntie Fabiha complained to father...
[33:23] Father went to work and...
[33:28] he scolded me and asked me to leave the house.
[33:40] How long will you turn the kids against me? Why don't you take them away and be end my problems.
[33:47] I understand everything. You send them here, so that Arhum makes my life hell.
[33:59] Your kids are being crushed by your jealousy.
[34:03] I don't them to revolt, so stop using them against me.
[35:57] In all of this...
[36:01] the kids got neglected, and we completely ignored it.
[36:06] When your feelings are buried...
[36:14] then it makes no difference what happens.
[36:22] I told you that this would have a bad effect on the kids.
[36:27] But you just wanted to pursue your happiness.
[36:37] All you wanted to be is happy.
[36:40] No matter the cost.
[36:51] I tried...
[36:57] I tried to fix everything... but...
[37:04] everything got ruined.
[37:11] You came...
[37:16] I tried to make you understand.
[37:19] I tried.... I asked you to control your emotions.
[37:31] Your emotional haste will destroy us.
[37:42] You couldn't control your emotions, and you couldn't be a good father.
[38:06] Can't everything return to how it was?
[38:13] Like stale water can't be used...
[38:21] like that... a buried person cannot be brought back.
[38:37] I just want my kids..
[38:50] And nothing else?
There's nothing left.
[39:17] Yes inspector...
What?
[39:21] You've found the kids?
[39:25] We've found the kids... a man brought them to the police station.
[39:32] Sir... there's a problem
[39:37] We've found the kids, but they don't want to come home.
What do you mean?
[39:46] There's a misunderstanding, I'll be right there.
[39:49] Hurry up, I think there's something wrong.
What are you saying?
[39:57] I want to come with you as well.
[39:59] You can't go... I'll bring the kids back... what if they don't come with you.
[40:03] I promise, I'll bring them back... they are my kids as well.
[40:11] Don't worry.
