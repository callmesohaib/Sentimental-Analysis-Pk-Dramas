[00:13] At least you could have told me so that I wouldn't have been embarrassed at the bank.
[00:18] How could I tell you since you're not talking to me? It seems that you'll only talk to me once my family bows down in front of you.
[00:25] Like a wound needs medicine, one needs family when one is hurt.
[00:32] I have no one here.
[00:34] That's why I will go to my family like Shenaya.
[00:39] Will you not listen to your husband?
I already have.
[00:42] Not anymore...
Your husband is still talking to you.
[00:47] No... a selfish man is talking who is afraid to be away from his daughter.
[00:59] She got so jealous when I mentioned Fabiha's name.
[01:06] And when she got jealous I felt at peace.
[01:13] Mother, what happened?
Fabiha had to go to the police station yesterday.
[01:20] You know how Arhum is... he couldn't let her go alone. He went along with her.
[01:26] I mentioned this to Shenaya.
[01:29] That was all the spark that was required for a fire
[01:35] She took out her anger on Fabiha.
[01:41] Meaning, brother Arhum out of sympathy...
[01:45] took Fabiha to the police station, and because of that his wife got jealous.
[01:53] Mother, how does Fabiha look?
[01:58] What do you mean?
Tell me...
[02:01] She's good... she has a good smile. Even though she is simple, she looks nice.
[02:10] Her beauty can come handy to us.
[02:17] Do as I say.
[02:29] Here is your favorite french fries and your sandwich.
[02:34] I don't want to eat this?
Why not?
[02:39] You made it with your dirty hands.
[02:42] Hadi don't eat it!
How do you know my hands are dirty?
[02:48] You are a maid, and a maid always has dirty hands.
[02:52] I'm a qualified caretaker, not a maid.
I told you that I don't want to eat this.
[03:01] Auntie Fabiha, after eating we'll see hide and seek.
Sure we will.
[03:11] It smells good... I think I should eat it.
[03:18] My mother says that people who get upset with food, food gets upset with them.
[03:23] Then they have to stay hungry, which can cause them to get sick.
[03:29] Then you can't go to school or do your homework. Then the teacher scolds you, it's so insulting.
[03:38] And when you don't eat you get old quickly.
[03:44] Also, Elsa is beautiful because she takes care of herself.
[03:55] Now eat it...
[03:57] Thank you.
You're welcome.
[04:00] Finish this, hurry up.
[04:05] We...
[04:07] made a grave mistake asking her to apologize.
[04:11] We shouldn't have done this.
[04:16] You are right.
[04:20] I made the wrong decision in haste.
To get yourself respected...
[04:26] one has to offer respect to the other person.
[04:30] If one starts breeding hate in their hearts...
[04:37] then there is no space left for respect.
[04:41] She maintained her husband's pride.
[04:46] Without caring for her respect she stood by my side.
[04:51] What you're saying is right.
[04:55] Anyways...
[04:57] I think we should tolerate her anger like she did ours.
[05:03] When someone forgives, it stays in their hearts forever...
[05:09] like that the one who apologizes remembers it forever as well.
[05:15] I think that we should give her some time.
[05:19] I will go with you to bring her back, do you hear?
[05:24] Not right now.
[05:26] Right now let her be for a few days...
[05:30] Sometimes we need to be away from someone to be close to them.
[05:37] God fills a mother's heart with love for her children.
[05:43] If only He could provide the strength to bear the pain associated with them.
[05:49] Please don't worry... everything will be alright.
[05:55] Otherwise you'll get sick. Listen...
[06:00] I want this to stay in our home. So please...
[06:04] don't mention this to Shenaya.
[06:07] I will not...
Thank you.
[06:12] What can I do?
Please don't worry.
[06:47] Mother didn't call me today.
[07:06] Hello...
Greetings*
[07:11] You didn't call me... so I decided to call you and share with you my happiness.
[07:15] Do you know after sister-in-law and brother came home, it's been so peaceful at home.
[07:20] And... mother couldn't believe it.
[07:24] At least someone found some peace.
[07:27] What do you mean?
Nothing... what I meant...
[07:31] Thank God that you guys got some peace in your life.
[07:37] What is the matter? You seem worried.
[07:41] You voice is cracking like you cried.
[07:45] What happened? Is everything alright? Did sister-in-law say something?
[07:48] No.... it's nothing like that. I was just not feeling well.
[07:55] I've taken some medicine, I will be alright in a while.
You're not well... I'm coming over...
[08:02] No... there's no need for that.
[08:05] Did something happen at home? Tell me the truth!
[08:10] No... it's nothing like that... don't worry.
[08:14] Alright.
[08:17] I was thinking if Anayah could visit today.
[08:20] Hareem misses her.
[08:24] Sure, let me ask Junaid...
[08:29] And... then I'll talk to you. Farewell.
[08:40] She hung up.
[08:49] How are you Farheen?
How are you?
[08:53] You've left me here in hell, you don't care about me.
[08:57] When are you sending my visa and ticket?
Why do you worry?
[09:02] Think that I've made permanent arrangements for you.
[09:06] Meaning?
The visa and ticket will be with you inside ten days.
[09:14] What? Really?
Of course... I swear.
[09:21] Haris... you don't know how happy you've made me.
Do one thing...
[09:27] Tell this to everyone at home...
[09:31] and be sure to tell your mother. Tell her that Haris..
[09:36] has change his fate, country and life.
[09:39] And what was the name of your mother's would be son-in-law... Hamza..
[09:47] He's still there... go and tell your mother.
[09:51] Hello Sonia... I was talking to mother just now and I decided to speak with you as well.
[09:58] I was wondering if Anayah could visit. Hareem misses her and if she comes here maybe we close this recent distance between us.
[10:06] No... the distances between us won't end Shenaya...
[10:10] How did you think that I could send Anayah to your home?
[10:14] Did you not find peace by humiliating me that now you're after my daughter?
[10:18] After last night, things got back to normal, right?
At your home...
[10:23] But things are the same at my home. And what kind of home it is... a place where sons-in-law and respected more than daughters-in-law.
[10:31] I didn't share good news with you... you will be happy to know that I've left your brother.
[10:39] What... what are you saying?
[10:43] What you're hearing... congratulations! To save your home, me and my husband have separated.
[10:53] You should be ashamed.
[10:58] The way you stole my husband from me and a father from my daughter...
[11:04] soon you'll have to go through this.
[11:11] Sonia... listen to me...
[11:17] Sister-in-law left home and mother didn't tell me.
[11:24] I am the one who should feel bad, after Hania called you guys, everything went so quiet.
[11:32] You didn't stand by us during our bad time. What is the point of having such a relationship?
[11:38] She called? Who did she call?
[11:42] Did Fareen not tell you that she talked to Hania?
[11:49] Look... I am ashamed in front of you...
[11:55] I don't have the words to apologize... I called Hamza a lot of times...
[12:02] but his phone was switched off.
I didn't expect this from you sister Shaheen.
[12:11] I was saying..
[12:21] No one from Hamza's home called... did you get any calls Farheen?
No mother...
[12:29] I didn't get anyone's call.
[12:33] Mother! Mother.. Haris called, he said that he would call me to Muscat in a ten or fifteen days.
[12:40] Haris... Haris.. Haris... that man has humiliated your mother.
[12:45] Did you get any calls... tell me!
[12:50] Why don't you speak? Did you get any calls?
Yes...
[12:53] Then why didn't you tell me? Get out of here... I don't want to see your face.
[13:00] You can return after ten days to pick up your stuff when you leave. Your mother is dead to you.
[13:07] Mother, I made a mistake... mother listen to me...
[13:12] Open the door please!
[13:15] Please... I made a huge mistake... give me a chance to explain.
[13:21] Mother...
[13:27] Mother... please open the door...
[13:35] Where are you... I got you!
[13:39] Auntie Fabiha caught father...
It's okay...
[13:44] Now it's father's turn.
 You guys go ahead...
[13:47] Let's play father...
Please father.
[13:50] The kids are asking you to... please play.
[13:52] Play with the kids... just for a while.
[13:57] Grab this bag...
[14:02] Tie this...
I won't be able to... auntie Hadia you go ahead.
[14:51] Something so big happened and you didn't tell me! Hiding things won't solve matters mother.
[14:57] My dear, Junaid asked me not to tell you. He didn't want to worry you.
[15:02] It is worrying for me that my brother's home is getting ruined because of me.
[15:07] Listen to me... Arhum shouldn't find out about this.
[15:12] What are you saying? I will talk to brother right now and ask him to bring sister Sonia back right now!
[15:18] No, don't speak in our matter. Take care of your home.
[15:23] Mother... when daughters get married they should worrying about their home.
[15:30] This ruins their reputation.
[15:35] You're saying that like I am a stranger to that place.
If only you were...
[15:40] otherwise I wouldn't have to explain it to you this way.
[15:45] Farewell.
[16:24] You forgot this outside... auntie had it sent.
Thanks.
[16:48] I'm sorry, my scarf got stuck.
[16:51] It's okay.... you could have knocked. You can let me know if you have any problem
[16:56] You should tell me.
[17:05] Fabiha...
[17:32] You should be ashamed... the way you stole my husband from me and my daughter's father from her.
[17:41] Soon you'll have to go through this
[18:29] How did you like it?
[18:33] For what?
Nothing...I just wanted to meet the Shenaya I met in university.
[18:43] Do you even remember her?
[18:46] How can I forgot?
[18:52] It is said that one never forget the first time that someone sees the person they love.
[18:57] Tell me what you remember about that day? How was my hairstyle... what was I wearing? What standard I was in?
[19:06] Second standard.
[19:09] The class was history of architecture...
[19:14] The clothes were bottle green, you had a brown bag and...
[19:21] the hairstyle was simple... just a few...
[19:26] strands here... still it was very simple.
[19:37] Nice to meet you Mr. Arhum.
[19:40] The pleasure is all mine Mrs. Arhum.
[19:44] What is this?
[19:47] You women are so strange... no matter if you're sad or happy, you start tearing up. Cheer up!
[19:53] We're going out to dinner... get ready...
Okay.
[19:58] I'm going to my mother.
[20:12] Are you afraid?
[20:15] Afraid of what?
That...
[20:20] might go away from you.
I have faith in my love.
[20:26] I have pride over it as well.
[20:31] And I will never let that pride break.
[20:50] Greetings sister.
[20:54] What's for dinner today?
[20:58] Poison!
[21:03] What's the matter?
[21:08] Did you cry all day? And what is this?
[21:15] Did mother hit you?
[21:19] There is no need to show me false sympathy, understand?
[21:25] All of this is happening because of you and Hamza.
[21:28] Because of Hamza... what did he do? He just came back from jail because of me.
[21:35] Yes... you and him are just poor souls.
[21:40] I'm insane... that's all I've heard, all my life.
[21:44] Ever since I was a child your name has been thrown at my face!
[21:50] What about the fear that causes me to lie?
[21:56] Everyone dislikes what I do... but has anyone asked why I do such things?
[22:05] I've been witnessing this ever since I was a child and now my life has become a circus.
[22:14] Sister.
[22:27] May I come in?
Sure... sit down. I want to talk to you.
[22:35] What is it?
First swear to me that you won't refuse.
[22:41] Tell me, what is it?
[22:45] I wanted to talk to you about Fabiha... that girl is alone.
[22:52] She runs her home without a father or a brother.
[22:56] She is forced and someone is taking advantage of that.
[23:02] I want you to help her. I want you to clear her debt.
[23:09] Did she something to you?
No, she didn't say anything to me.
[23:13] I'm sure she won't take the money from you.
[23:18] I will find a way to give it to her.
[23:22] We can cut it from her salary gradually.
[23:29] Sure... we'll do as you say.
[23:32] Alright..
[23:35] Don't tell Shenaya about this.
[23:38] Why?
[23:40] I don't know how she'll take it. I don't want you two fighting because of this.
[23:45] Alright, I won't tell her. 
[23:49] Shenaya and I are going out to dinner. The kids are sleeping. We'll be back late.
[23:56] Make sure it's not too late... you know I get worried sick when I'm alone.
[24:00] Alright... we'll be back soon.
[24:04] And... you can call me if you need anything, I'll come right over.
[24:07] Alright fine... go.
[24:12] Alright farewell.
May God protect you.
[27:04] Thank you*
[27:20] There are some moments in life that whenever you remember them...
[27:26] you smile.
[27:34] I brought you here to see you smile.
[27:40] There are some places that has a special place in one's heart.
[27:43] And this is one of those places. We started our life here.
[27:50] We're still together...
[27:54] And I always want us to be together.
[27:57] And I promise that I will always stay with you?
[28:02] Promise?
Promise.
[28:30] Mother, I admit that she didn't tell you about Hania's call... but what need was there to slap her?
[28:37] There was... I cannot tolerate lies.
[28:41] Mother you know how she is...
I tolerated her enough times!
[28:46] Do you know how embarrassed I was in front of your mother-in-law.
I know, that why I asked you to call Hamza, then why didn't you?
[28:53] I did... it was switched off.
[29:02] What time is this for load shedding? Let me check.
[29:13] We ate, had coffee... what are we waiting for? Let's go...
[29:17] Just two minutes... one... two... three...
[29:27] Oh my God...
Happy anniversary*
[29:33] Let's cut the cake and celebrate..
[29:43] Thank you Arhum...
[30:03] It's just us who lost our light.
[30:12] Surprise!
[30:15] Sings happy birthday*
[30:21] Sings happy birthday*
[30:29] Sings happy birthday*
[30:37] And... 
[30:45] How did you like my surprise?
What is all this Hamza?
[30:51] What do you mean? It's like I'm doing something like this for the first time.
[30:56] Fabiha it's been five years since our relationships... and we've celebrated five birthdays together.
[31:01] I'm not a child...
He loves you and you should answer him back with love.
[31:07] Come on, cut the cake.
[31:17] Give me the knife...
Here you are.
[31:22] Call sister as well.
[31:28] You call her.
[31:38] Sings happy birthday*
[31:46] Sings happy birthday*
[31:53] Sings happy birthday*
[32:01] Sings happy birthday*
[32:05] Sister... come and have cake.
[32:11] This is something to celebrate... I'll feed it to her myself.
[32:19] I congratulate you on your sister's birthday... open your mouth!
[32:24] Come on... open your mouth..
[32:40] What kind of behavior is this?
[32:56] I apologize on behalf of Farheen.
[33:00] There is no need for that... don't I know her... it's alright.
[33:07] Fabiha... go and make a cup of tea for Hamza, and clean this up.
[33:14] Sit down my dear...
[33:35] Why didn't you change?
[33:38] I just want time to stop...
[33:44] Shenaya, all my time is yours. Whether day or night...
[33:49] It makes no difference what it is.
[33:53] It does.
[33:57] This is the time...
[34:00] where we are with each other. We are near each other.
[34:06] Otherwise we fulfill each other responsibilities.
[34:11] Are you afraid?
[34:14] About what?
That...
[34:19] I might go away from you?
I have full faith in my love...
[34:26] I have pride over it as well.
[34:30] I will never break this pride break.
I know.
[34:38] Go and change now...
Oh!
[34:42] Who is it?
[34:45] It's call time for tomorrow. I have a meeting with a client.
[34:49] Alright...
I'll go and change... and yes...
[34:53] Hadi's teacher called, tomorrow is defense day, he's performing and we have to be there.
[34:59] Anything else?
Nothing.
[35:12] What did you just do outside? If you didn't want to eat the cake, you could have come inside, why did you throw it away?
[35:20] If someone wants to eat cake they can, I didn't want to.
[35:24] Tell me... why do you mind? You treat Hamza the same when you want to.
[35:32] Now that I've done this today... your dormant love for him has awakened.
[35:37] I don't humiliate him.
It's not that different. Whether someone refuses with love or anger...
[35:44] That person is always humiliated.
You took out mother's anger on him.
[35:49] Yes... Haris gets humiliated as well. Ask Hamza to get used to it.
[35:54] What you're doing is not right.
Tell that to mother. I'll be fine once she stops differentiating.
[36:01] Besides... it's only a matter of a few days now.
[36:05] Haris is sending my visa and ticket. I've talked to him.
[36:18] Anything else?
[36:42] Arhum get up... it's eight...
[36:46] Arhum, you're running late.. get up.
[36:55] Arhum...
[37:00] Don't you feel like going to work today?
[37:07] What happened? Are you feeling well?
[37:12] My body hurts and I feel a fever coming.
[37:17] Then why didn't you tell me? I would have turned off the AC... you must be feeling cold.
[37:22] You don't have a temperature.
[37:25] I think you have flu or a cough... you'll be alright.
[37:30] I'll bring breakfast and the medicine as well.
[37:35] I'll call my boss and cancel the meeting.
No... you have an important meeting.
[37:41] If you cancel last moment, your boss will get upset.
[37:45] I'll manage... go...
Nothing is more important than you.
[37:51] I'll handle my boss. It's an international client, you won't find another one easily.
[37:59] Go ahead... just get me breakfast. I'll have the medicine once I'm down.
[38:09] I'll keep the breakfast at the table. Be sure to take your medicine.
[38:15] Please take care.... go..
