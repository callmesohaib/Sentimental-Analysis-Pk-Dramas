[00:13] You have said it today.
[00:15] Don't even think again that I can live without you.
[00:24] Arham
[00:26] I even trust your breath that much
[00:30] That they won't betray me.
[00:36] How dare you?
[00:39] Get out of my house.
[00:41] Get out of my house, right now, right away.
[00:51] Sanaya
Sanaya
[00:53] Sanaya if you are not stopping for me then please stop for the sake of children.
[00:56] You should have thought about it earlier.
[00:58] Sanaya I am really sorry. Please.
[01:01] Sorry
[01:03] Just sorry
[01:08] Do you know Arham
[01:10] I am not angry with you at all and I don't have any grievances from you.
[01:18] I was fool that everything kept happening in front of me but I couldn't realize that.
[01:24] Damn
[01:28] Only one thing left Arham
[01:32] Leave my hand
[01:35] Otherwise that will be used as well.
[02:01] Arham
[02:06] Arham
[02:08] Say something.
[02:10] What happened that Sanaya has left the home.
[02:19] I am asking you.
[02:23] I made a mistake.
[02:25] I should have informed Sanaya
[02:29] What you should have told her?
[02:33] Tell me Arham.
The truth, mom.
[02:37] I would handle the situation later but I should have told her the truth.
[02:43] I am unable to understand what are you saying. Tell me what happened.
[02:50] I couldn't realize mom.
[02:53] I couldn't realize that how I fell in love with Fabeeha
[03:10] What do you think?
[03:14] Only woman needs time.
[03:19] A man doesn't need time, isn't he a human being as well?
[03:24] He needs that.
[03:27] And I also needed that.
[03:32] But Sanaya was busy.
[03:35] Sometime in office and sometime in meetings.
[03:40] And Fabeeha gave me her time.
[03:46] And I couldn't realize while passing time with her.
[03:52] I made that mistake.
[03:56] I made that mistake mom.
[04:02] I don't want to lose Sanaya.
[04:08] But what should I do?
[04:11] What should I do? Ever since I have come close to Fabeeha, I can't stay away from her.
[04:22] On one side there is Sanaya and on the other side there is Fabeeha while I am grinding between the two parts of the grinding mill.
[04:29] And I know that neither Sanaya is at fault nor Fabeeha. It's my fault.
[04:34] And now I feel that I should have died before all of this but
[04:40] So just leave it, you won't understand. Not you but no one will understand because I am a man.
[04:48] That a man is wrong.
[05:27] I am very embarrassed aunt.
[05:29] Whatever Haniya did, I am apologizing for that.
[05:34] And I also apologize to Fabeeha.
[05:37] Actually, Haniya is very emotional and gets angry very quickly.
[05:41] It's OK but even then
[05:44] Haniya should take care of relations, Fabeeha is elder than her.
[05:49] And she should have taken care of other person's relation before insulting her.
[05:58] Fabeeha always takes care of your respect and honor.
[06:02] She takes very good care of your respect and honor along with her own.
[06:07] You are right and I know this thing very well.
[06:12] That's why I am really embarrassed and I want to apologize to both of you.
[06:19] As you know my son
[06:22] Fabeeha is very sensitive about her dignity and she never did anything wrong.
[06:29] Yes
[06:30] Aunt, Haniya will also apologize to Fabeeha if she wants.
[06:37] Yes
[06:40] To keep relations in tact she should apologize to Fabeeha.
[06:48] You sit here, let me see.
[07:11] Fabeeha
[07:14] Fabeeha listen to me.
[07:16] Why have you come early today?
[07:22] Fabeeha
[07:29] She is angry because of that incident. She will become normal. Why are you standing? Sit.
[07:44] Let me bring tea for you.
[07:56] I don't know why I am having strange feeling today.
[08:01] I have been feeling nervous since morning.
Have you taken medicine?
[08:05] Somiya gives me medicine without any gap daily.
[08:11] So why are you so depressed?
[08:14] I am depressed because of Sanaya. I am worried for her.
[08:19] May God keeps her blessed and happy.
[08:22] Ameen
[08:24] Sanaya told me that Arham will pick children during lunch break.
[08:29] It's so late but he hasn't come yet.
[08:32] I don't why didn't he come?
[08:34] Call brother Arham and ask him.
[08:37] And if he can't come then no problem we will drop them when we will go to mom's house.
OK.
[08:46] He is not receiving my call.
Call Sanaya.
[08:59] She isn't receiving call as well.
[09:01] Oh God.
No problem we will drop them.
That would be great.
[09:07] OK
[09:10] Hey, Fabeeha, what happened?
[09:15] How did you get injured?
[09:17] Tell me.
[09:20] And what is this mark on your face?
[09:23] As if someone has slapped you. Fabeeha look at me.
[09:29] Fabeeha, has your secret revealed in front of Sanaya?
[09:33] She did this.
[09:38] And didn't Arham say anything?
[09:47] Did he call you?
[09:54] Well, this reaction had to come.
[09:59] No wife can bear that her husband starts to like any other girl.
[10:07] I will take revenge for this slap from Sanaya.
[10:12] But you will take revenge if you will be able to re-enter that house.
[10:17] Sanaya won't allow you to enter you in her house again so it would be better for you to remove any such thought from your mind.
[10:26] I know that Arham loves me.
[10:31] Are you still thinking that Arham loves you?
[10:34] Who didn't even call you and didn't even ask about your well being.
[10:39] Forget Arham because Sanaya is not only his wife but also mother of his children.
[10:45] Show me your hand.
[10:59] Let's go Hareem and Hadi, don't you want to go to your house?
[11:04] Mom has come to take us.
[11:09] Sanaya, what happened?
[11:11] What happened my dear? Why are you crying?
[11:15] My child, my dear, what happened? Why are you crying?
[11:21] Come here and sit.
[11:24] What happened?
Sit.
[11:25] Mom.
Sit.
[11:37] Receive Arham's call.
[11:41] No mom.
Mom, dad is calling.
[11:46] Hi dad, mom is crying badly.
[11:50] Mom
[11:51] What happened Sanaya? Tell us something.
[11:54] What happened my child?
Your daughter made a very big mistake.
[11:58] Which mistake?
[12:01] I made a mistake to trust other woman despite I am also a woman.
[12:08] What do you mean?
[12:12] Arham broke my trust brother.
[12:16] And he shared my love and place with that Fabeeha
[12:25] What has he done? Let me talk to him.
[12:29] No brother you won't talk to him and no one will talk to anyone.
[12:34] This is my decision.
[12:37] And I want to make this decision myself.
[12:41] Be brave my daughter.
[12:47] Granny
[12:49] Won't mom go back to home with us?
Don't say this my child.
[12:54] Be brave my child.
[12:58] Have patience and be brave.
[13:05] Are you still thinking that Arham loves you?
[13:09] Who didn't even call you back and didn't even ask for your well being.
[13:14] Forget Arham because Sanaya is not only his wife but also mother of his children.
[13:36] Fabeeha
[13:39] Oh no
[13:41] Fabeeha listen to me. I want to...
Wasn't that humiliation from your sister enough that you have come here as well. Get out of here.
[13:49] Listen, I know that you are angry with me.
Hamza, I am not angry.
[13:55] And the truth is that I don't want to live with you.
[13:58] I don't want to maintain any relationship with you.
What happened and why are you saying this?
[14:03] I love you and I can't live without you.
[14:09] Look at me once, look how my heart is shaking.
[14:14] I can't even think about going away from you. Don't hurt my feelings.
[14:19] What do I do with your empty heart? Tell me.
[14:23] And don't say that you love me. I hate that you love me.
[14:29] We love that person who has some worth and what is your worth.
[14:33] You can only feed me that's it.
[14:37] I don't want to live with empty stomach. I want to spend my life in a very good manner.
[14:41] I don't want to live in poverty with you. Get lost from here.
[14:45] I will die without you.
[14:50] OK then you should die.
[14:51] But for God's sake, leave me.
[15:25] Hamza tea is ready. Take it.
[15:30] Hamza. Hamza
[15:34] What happened to him?
[15:36] Fabeeha
[16:25] Leave my hand otherwise that will be used as well.
[17:05] Brother. Brother.
[17:10] I became a fool.
[17:16] Both you and sister-in-law advised me.
[17:19] But I didn't listen to anyone.
[17:24] If I had listened then I would have betrayed my husband's trust.
[17:30] Did I do wrong mom?
[17:33] Woman can make mistakes in her innocence.
[17:36] You made mistake by giving freedom to Fabeeha.
[17:41] You came here and leave Arham free as well.
[17:48] You should have come here by leaving Arham.
[17:54] Some time we have to make some decisions against our liking just to make other person realize about our importance.
[18:01] Arham has betrayed my love.
[18:08] To be a loyal person a loyal person is needed.
[18:12] How could I move on by forgetting everything? Tell me mom.
[18:18] Woman has to give sacrifices.
[18:21] And she can bear all these sacrifices.
[18:24] And she spends her life according to her husband's wish.
[18:30] I won't do any such thing. My children are my strength.
[18:36] If Arham is free to make his decision then I am free as well.
[18:40] But you are married and mother of two children.
[18:44] And mother is that only person who never thinks about herself.
[18:50] Your children need you.
[18:53] Your children' personalities will be effected because of your conflicts.
[18:58] I don't want you to go back to your home immediately.
[19:03] Give yourself some time to recover.
[19:07] You will understand everything with the passage of time.
[19:13] Sometime time doesn't fix everything mom rather everything is finished.
[19:30] I won't go anywhere.
[19:34] Everything will be done as per your wish.
[19:40] Let's go home and leave your stubbornness.
I am not showing stubbornness in fact you are showing that.
[19:48] I won't go anywhere from here and nor my children
[19:51] If anyone will go then it's you.
[20:05] There is a big problem Hadiya.
[20:09] Sanaya has known about Arham's friendship with Fabeeha and she has left house.
[20:15] So, didn't you stop her?
[20:17] How could I stop her?
[20:20] Arham begged in front of her to stop her for so long.
[20:27] But no, she packed her bag and went away without listening to him.
[20:35] Arham has done planning for his future.
[20:39] The way he has told me about his decision, I am very scared Hadiya.
[20:45] And that too with a care taker.
[20:50] Mom I forbade you that don't give that girl that much freedom.
[20:54] But no, you said that she is a nice girl. Now see how nice she is.
[21:01] And I also told you that such middle class girls have very high ambitions.
[21:06] And they can cause damage to anyone just to fulfill their ambitions.
[21:09] She has trapped my innocent brother.
[21:12] What do you think that Fabeeha will leave him easily? Never.
[21:17] She has found her dream prince.
[21:20] But I didn't want Arham to marry her.
[21:23] I just wanted to teach lesson to Sanaya.
[21:29] If she will lose her importance then she will decide whether to continue her job or not.
[21:34] I didn't know that he will want to marry her.
Mom.
[21:38] What had to happen has happened. Now tell me that what should we do?
[21:43] Get Fabeeha out from brother Arham's life.
[21:47] Do something to get her out of there.
No.
[21:51] I am unable to understand anything.
[21:53] I am unable to understand that what should I do.
[21:58] There is nothing to think, tell brother Arham to go to sister Sanaya's house and apologize to her. He should beg in front of her and bring her back.
[22:06] Mom, a marriage is scheduled in my in-laws after few days.
[22:10] I will have to respond to everyone if sister Sanaya won't attend that marriage.
[22:14] Sanaya won't listen to anyone at the moment Hadiya, she won't listen to anyone.
[22:20] If she would listen then I would have talked to her but she won't listen.
[22:24] Mom, that will be really bad if sister Sanaya left her place at the moment.
[22:30] Then Fabeeha is ready to fill her place and she will never back off.
[22:35] Mom, do something and tell brother Arham to bring sister Sanaya back at any cost.
[23:00] What did you say to Hamza?
[23:03] The same thing which I should have said much earlier.
[23:06] I have told him clearly that he shouldn't take my love's support.
[23:11] Fabeeha
[23:12] Do you have any idea that how upset Hamza is at the moment
[23:16] Sister, right now I am only worried about my problem so I can't think about anyone else' worry.
[23:22] It's OK then go and tell mom so that this matter can be closed at once.
[23:29] She will know by herself.
[23:34] Do you think that Hamza will forget his love that easily?
[23:40] No matter whether Arham comes in my life or not but Hamza, never ever.
[24:10] What will I do with your empty heart.
[24:12] Tell me and don't tell me that you love me. I hate that you love me
[24:18] Hamza, we love that person who has some worth and what is your worth? You can only feed me and that's it.
[24:23] I don't want to spend my life with empty stomach. I want to spend my life in a very good manner.
[24:27] I don't want to die with you in poverty. Get lost from here.
[24:31] I will die without you.
So you should die.
[24:36] But for God's sake, leave me alone.
[25:05] Are you crying?
[25:09] Tell me the truth, what's the matter?
[25:13] Nothing.
[25:17] Tell me now.
[25:22] She wants to end every kind of relation with me.
What?
[25:30] She has been changed.
She didn't change brother. In fact you have understood.
[25:38] You were fell in one sided love.
[25:41] And when you listened from her mouth today then you are not ready to believe that.
[25:48] If our mother is not among us today then it's only because of Fabeeha.
[25:57] Haniya, I don't believe what Fabeeha said to me.
[26:03] Sister Farheen is far better than her.
[26:09] I loved her so much and in every way.
[26:13] What else does a girl want?
[26:17] House, car, bank balance and status.
[26:22] And you don't have anyone from these things except love.
[26:27] And according to her, love can't feed anyone. Right?
[26:36] Please don't cry now.
[27:44] I want to marry you.
[27:46] What will people say, have you thought about that?
[27:50] I don't care.
[28:59] Sister, where is Sanaya?
[29:24] Sanaya
[29:28] Let's go home, I am here to take you back.
[29:33] The trust of mine you have broken
[29:36] Do you really feel that I should go with you after that?
[29:43] Sanaya this is not the right place to discuss this matter. Let's go home and discuss there.
[29:48] I won't go anywhere.
[29:52] We will do whatever you want.
[29:58] Let's go home please. Stop this stubbornness.
I am not showing stubbornness you are showing that.
[30:05] I won't go anywhere from here nor my children.
[30:09] If anyone will go then it's you.
[30:23] I admit Sanaya
[30:28] I have made that mistake.
[30:34] But don't give me such a big punishment by making my mistake a sin and don't stay away from me.
[30:44] Didn't you punish me and my children?
[30:51] And that too for the whole life.
[30:59] You have betrayed me.
[31:03] You broke my love and pride and broke my trust.
[31:14] And if someone is given a punishment then there is no respite in that.
[31:20] Trust me, that was not my mistake. Whatever happened was unintentional. I didn't want that to happen.
[31:27] I swear.
Huh
[31:29] Those who swear are liars.
[31:35] And I might have believed you if I hadn't seen that with my own eyes but now I neither believe you nor on your swears.
[31:42] Please don't do this, I can't live without you.
But you will have to live without me.
[32:04] OK, if you won't go with me then I will use my right and will take you with me forcefully.
[32:10] You have remembered your right but you didn't even think once when you were giving my right to someone else.
[32:21] What was left? What was left Arham? I spent my life according to your wishes.
[32:27] I did whatever you said. I kept doing everything as per your wishes. So what was left that your thoughts were changed.
[32:34] I was with you in every good and bad time. I was with you all the time then what was left?
[32:39] Why did you change your thoughts, I don't know.
I made that mistake.
[32:44] I admit that I made that mistake.
[32:48] And I understand your emotions as well and I know that it's not easy for you to trust my intentions but
[32:57] I wanted to tell you.
[33:01] I tried many times.
[33:04] I got chances
[33:12] But whenever I saw your face, I got scared of losing you so I couldn't tell you.
[33:23] You may leave now. Please leave.
[33:36] Sanaya I won't leave without taking you with me.
[33:39] I said just leave, I won't go anywhere from here.
[34:43] Sanaya
[34:45] Oh man, how do you recognize me?
[34:50] I recognize you from your foot step. And for recognition, the person must be a stranger.
[34:56] And the person whom we love can never be forgotten.
[35:00] And you are my life so how can anyone forget his life?
[35:05] So, keep loving me by considering me your life.
[35:12] Don't become a stranger.
[35:15] Because strangers betray us.
[35:22] Never
[35:24] I can't even think of betraying you.
[36:09] Dad
[36:17] Dad you are here to take us back to home?
[36:22] But I won't take you back today.
[36:24] Your mom is not feeling well and if I will take you then who will take care of her.
[36:29] So both you and Hareem will take care of mom.
[36:34] Where is Hareem?
Hareem is in washroom.
[36:40] Dad loves you so much. Right?
[36:52] Here is hot milk for you mom.
[36:56] Put it here. I will drink later.
[37:01] Have children slept?
No mom.
[37:04] You know that when they are together they don't want to sleep early.
And what about Sanaya?
[37:12] Brother Arham came to take Sanaya back.
[37:15] Didn't she go?
[37:17] No mom.
[37:19] I don't know why Sanaya is showing stubbornness?
[37:22] Mom, we show stubbornness when our feelings are hurt.
[37:27] If Arham wants to close this matter then Sanaya should also close this matter.
[37:33] Both of them should sort out this issue together.
Mom, you should give Sanaya some time.
[37:39] It's a very difficult time for her.
[37:43] This is Sanaya's house and she can stay here as long as she want.
[37:46] But married girls don't look good if they live in their mom's house.
[37:51] Sanaya is mother of two children
[37:54] She should think about her children that there will be bad effect on her children.
[38:02] Yes you are right mom.
[38:07] Sanaya is very lucky.
[38:10] If it comes on ego then man doesn't look back.
[38:19] But she isn't understanding this thing.
[38:30] Have you been sitting here since morning?
Yes.
[38:32] I have been going out and coming back in since morning.
[38:37] Thank God.
[38:39] Mom, I am worried after seeing you.
You did right Hadiya
[38:45] You did right by coming here.
[38:48] Mom, had you left any other option for me. Such a big event happened otherwise my flight was scheduled after two days.
[38:56] And what was the need to give that much freedom to Fabeeha now did you see the consequences.
Oh my child.
[39:02] We will have to change Arham's intentions somehow lest he may marry Fabeeha.
[39:11] Mom, that ordinary girl want to fulfill her dreams and you have shown her the way.
[39:19] How did you forget that brother is also a man and every man is alike no matter whether he is a son or husband. He is not trustworthy.
[39:25] But we didn't think about it.
[39:28] We thought about something else and I told you about that.
[39:32] We thought about teaching lesson to Sanaya but we didn't know
[39:38] This boy is such a big fool.
[39:42] Now stop your brother somehow.
OK, let me talk to him.
[39:48] Where is he?
[39:50] He has gone to bring Sanaya back.
[39:54] I am telling you that she won't get convinced that easily.
[39:58] Yes, I also know that.
[40:02] Sister is very stubborn and now she has gotten a chance to make brother as her puppet.
[40:09] Well, our trick back fired on us.
[40:15] O God help us.
[40:18] Why are you worried? I am here.
[40:20] I won't let that girl enter this house at all.
