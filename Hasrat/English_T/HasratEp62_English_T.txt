[02:42] Arham
[02:44] Arham, what's the matter? Are you fine?
[02:49] I am feeling dizzy
[02:54] you are having a very high fever, come let me give you a medicine
 No no... 
[02:59] I will be fine
[03:03] Now that you are making me habitual of it, don't spoil me
[03:13] a person like me should be treated like this
[03:49] Arham, do the breakfast then you have to take the medicine as well
[03:55] leave it
[04:00] you may go
[04:07] then drink some milk
[04:10] you have to eat something first to take the medicine
[04:41] get up, Arham
[04:59] I am coming in a while
[05:53] Hadi, be careful don't hurt yourself & don't annoy your sister Hareem. Ok?
[06:06] hello! How are you Hadia?
[06:08] I am absolutely fine, how are the kids?
[06:12] I am perfectly fine, also the kids are doing well
[06:18] sister, are you happy?
[06:22] Hadia, do you know?
[06:24] Sometimes, we close the doors of our heart because we become weary of these moments of happiness
[06:30] The happiness died a long time ago
[06:32] What will I achieve now by continuing to live in them?
[06:35] sister, you are absolutely correct
[06:37] one day all of us will die
[06:40] but it doesn't mean that we shall stop living
[06:45] Children play a vital role in a husband and wife's relationship
[06:49] the relation becomes stronger because of the children
[06:52] why are you tolerating all this?
[06:55] for your kids, right?
[06:58] I will say, please forget the past & move on
[07:03] with a happy heart & mind
[07:05] I won't be able to do it, Hadia
[07:09] Arham's actions have hurt me a lot
[07:14] And the account of deeds will be settled on the Day of Judgment
[07:17] you are right sister, but we have to live until the day of judgment
[07:22] and how will you live under the same roof like two strangers?
[07:26] have you ever thought about your children?
[07:29] They must have been mentally disturbed to take such a big step
[07:36] you should be thankful to God that you've found them back
[07:39] it means that God also wants you both to stay together
[07:45] please sister, be happy in God's will & move on
[07:50] for the sake of your children
[07:52] It's very important for two people's minds to be compatible in order to spend a life together, Hadia
[07:57] answer me one thing
[07:59] If a woman makes a mistake, a man threatens her with a second marriage
[08:06] Now another woman will come and tell me how to respect my husband and nurture the relationship?
[08:14] A woman who has managed without money
[08:19] supported you in the poor conditions
[08:21] took care of you & your house by doing the job
[08:24] tolerated the taunts of her family & other people
[08:27] What that woman is punished for?
[08:31] for tolerating the poor conditions? or for supporting?
[08:35] or for being a woman?
[08:38] I have endured every punishment for your brother, Hadia
[08:43] But I don't have the courage anymore to tolerate
[08:47] tell me, what shall I do?
[08:49] Sister, I want to say once again that I want my brother's marriage to remain intact
[08:55] and I am very guilty that brother Arham did all this with you
[08:59] but please give this relation another chance for the sake of your children. Please
[09:04] See, the kids are happy to see you both together. How will you raise them all alone?
[09:11] I want the kids' happiness to remain intact
[09:13] both of them shall always see you both together & you all shall always stay happy & together like this
[09:18] sister... 
[09:20] do think upon my words, please
[09:23] bye!
[09:36] Hadi Hadi.. .
[09:40] I will.. 
yaay.... 
[10:16] hello!
[10:17] Hello?
[10:18] this is Shaheen speaking, Fabiha's mother
[10:23] yes aunty, I have recognized you. How are you?
[10:26] how are you?
[10:28] I am fine
[10:30] actually I want to talk to you about Fabiha
[10:37] aunty, whatever Fabiha did with me after that.. 
[10:43] Anyway, I had cared about her condition, despite the way she had treated my kids afterwards.. 
[10:49] its not possible for her to live in this house
[10:52] neither in my life
[10:54] but I do care about the baby who isn't born yet
[10:57] dear look, humans do make mistakes
[11:01] Fabiha also did
[11:03] but end this matter for the sake of your baby
[11:07] Relationships thrive when you promptly resolve conflicts
[11:12] for now I want to stay away from her, aunty
[11:16] If you want this relationship to stay intact, please keep her with you for a few days
[11:22] maybe I forget everything when I see my baby's face
[11:26] but for now its not possible for me & her to stay under the same roof
[11:30] Okay, is it possible for you to come today & take her to the doctor?
[11:36] okay
[11:37] I will fulfill my duty
[11:41] I will come at night
[12:04] Sanaya
[12:07] won't you go to your office?
[12:09] No, I took a day off
[12:13] for me?
[12:15] No
[12:16] There is renovation happening in my office, so the boss has asked me to work from home
[12:21] how is your fever now?
[12:23] I am feeling better
[12:24] Good!
[12:28] thank you, Sanaya
[12:30] I can at least do this much for you as a gesture of humanity
[12:34] I have made soup for you & do not forget to take the afternoon's medicine
[12:38] means you won't give me afternoon's medicine?
[12:42] you are much better now that you can take the medicine yourself
[12:45] its kept on your side table
[12:50] you've made yourself so stone-hearted, Sanaya
[12:52] do you know Arham
[12:54] my mother used to say
[12:58] a woman who spends her entire life on her man
[13:03] she takes care of him, & loves him
[13:05] a man takes its revenge at the age of 60 years
[13:09] when a woman gets tired by fulfilling all her responsibilities
[13:15] A woman falls in love at a young age, and a man falls in love at an old age
[13:19] but you have made me an old person before time
[13:32] so much of hatred, Sanaya
[13:34] its not hatred, Arham
[13:36] It's just a facade to keep the kids happy
[13:45] Sanaya, whether anything kills me or not but I think
[13:49] this loneliness will kill me
[13:53] You've begun to fear loneliness after sleeping alone for just two days
[13:58] Do you have any idea how many nights I have spent without you?
[14:02] Even if you spend that many nights alone, you still won't be able to repent for my pain
[14:09] the pain I had endured without any wound, Arham
[14:14] you cannot repent for it, even if you want to
[14:19] Sanaya, after shattering everything with my own hands, I don't know how to gather everything again
[14:26] and if you won't support me then
[14:29] its impossible!
[14:31] I have tried a lot Arham, but.. 
[14:36] I couldn't adjust myself
[14:39] I won't be able to do it
[14:43] your tea
[15:24] Greetings sister, how are you?
[15:27] Greetings! How are you?
[15:29] I am fine, you tell me are you done with packing?
[15:34] yes, by the way you sound quite fresh today. What's the matter?
[15:38] You may have felt that way, but I haven't felt that way
[15:42] anyways, tell me are you done with all the packing? Anaya must be very happy
[15:47] Yes, ever since she found out that we are going to the UK, she has been insisting that she will take Hareem along with her
[15:55] its their love to stay together, sister
[15:58] absolutely correct
[16:00] one falls in love when they stay together
[16:03] You'll see, God willing, you'll also fall in love with Brother Arham again
[16:10] No sister
[16:13] I cannot fall in love with Arham again
[16:18] ok tell me, when is your flight?
[16:21] its an early morning flight
[16:23] what! so soon?
[16:26] and I couldn't come to meet you guys as of yet
[16:28] its okay, you don't need to come though
[16:32] we will try to visit you at night
[16:36] but I should have come, sister
[16:38] it doesn't make any difference, whether you come or I come. Its the same thing
[16:41] Besides, Junaid was saying that we'll leave for the airport directly from there
[16:47] Okay fine, as you wish
[16:50] Okay, bye!
bye!
[17:03] what happened? why are you guys laughing?
[17:05] dad, your face is covered with the flour
[17:10] really? here you go. Is it fine now?
[17:15] what did you do?
[17:16] I am baking cake for your mom, tomorrow is her birthday so its a surprise for her
[17:20] really?
yaay... means now mom won't be upset anymore
[17:26] who told you that mom & dad are upset with each other? Its nothing like that
[17:30] We know mom is angry with you
[17:33] she is pretending for us as if she is not upset with you
[17:39] I have you both, I don't need anything else. I am happy & your mom is happy as well
[17:43] give it to me
[17:46] what's happening?
[17:49] have you guys seen your face?
[17:51] dad did this!
yes, he did it
[17:53] don;t worry, I will clean everything
[17:55] come on, quickly wash your face
[17:58] hurry up!
[18:03] Brother Junaid is moving to the UK permanently with his family
[18:07] they are coming to meet me tomorrow, & I don't want anything inappropriate to happen in front of them
[18:11] so it would be better for you not to come in front of him
[18:20] Okay
[20:03] don't pity on me, mom
[20:05] whatever is happening with me is absolutely correct
[20:08] I deserve this!
[20:11] and I should be treated this way
[20:15] The wounds life has given me can never be healed
[20:20] Your wounds will heal
[20:22] if not today then tomorrow
[20:25] When the good days are gone, the bad days won't stay either
[20:31] shall I ask you a question?
[20:35] why are you feeling pity on me?
[20:40] the distress I have been through, you haven't
[20:44] The extent to which I have reached today, the person I have become today while enduring that distress
[20:49] you were not there
[20:53] you are about to become a mother
[20:56] Soon you will get an answer
[21:01] that what is the status of a mother
[21:04] how she pines for her children
[21:08] how she realizes the pain of everything
[21:12] she tries her level best...
[21:16] To alleviate her children's pain by any means necessary
[21:23] mom, I haven't done anything wrong with anyone
[21:33] Whenever anything happens, it's always time that is to blame
[21:42] You might remember, I was so young
[21:48] when I went outside the house to take care of its expenses
[21:53] You didn't care about me at that time; you didn't show any pity for me
[21:58] Dad was not there, so I had to handle the household expenses
[22:02] Food, drink, sister's expenses, your expenses
[22:07] I took all the responsibilities
[22:10] I had become like your son
[22:15] And many days, men used to look at me like vultures ready to devour me
[22:22] Only I know how I gathered myself and came back home
[22:29] I had never let you feel this
[22:36] But while taking care of these household responsibilities, my own life got lost somewhere
[22:40] nobody care about my happiness
[22:44] I am also human; I too deserve happiness. My wishes should also be fulfilled
[22:52] but no
[22:55] A lot was going on in my life when Arham entered
[23:03] What could I have done?
[23:07] On one side, it was Hamza
[23:10] and on the other side it was Arham
[23:17] Arham saved your daughter's life
[23:20] and saved her honor
[23:22] and you!
[23:26] you had ousted me from your house
[23:30] don't you know how cruel this world is!
[23:34] You didn't think of me at that time
[23:40] Still, I am seen as the bad person in everyone's perspective
[23:48] Arham made me his honor
[23:51] He married me; I haven't done any mistake or anything illegal, Mom.
[24:14] And do you remember, you asked me on the phone how Arham had ousted Sanaya from the house?
[24:22] mom, I kept the expired milk in the fridge
[24:25] and Arham thought that Sanaya did all this to kill my baby
[24:31] I took advantage of that situation and...
[24:35] started provoking Arham against Sanaya & I kept doing all this
[24:40] Because time was on my side
[24:45] I tried so hard to fix everything after going to that house and to make my space there, but, Mom...
[24:49] nobody had accepted me
[24:56] I wanted everyone's well-being
[24:59] I used to think good for everyone
[25:01] I didn't had any ill intentions for anyone
[25:06] But... then I thought, if they don't want to accept me and think I am a bad person, then fine
[25:12] let it be
[25:15] Then I did everything that I felt was right
[25:20] I got Sanaya ousted from the house
[25:22] I made the children on my side
[25:25] kept Arham with me
[25:32] I used to stay in a fear that if Sanaya comes back
[25:38] Then she will also kick me out of the house, just like you kicked me out of your house
[25:44] I keep ending up being the bad person
[25:48] and then I have accepted everything
[25:54] And sometimes I feel like strangling Sanaya to death
[26:00] I shall kill her & remove her from Arham's life forever
[26:04] and everything shall be only mine!
[26:06] I was fed-up of my life
[26:09] Of those responsibilities that I never wanted to take care of, Mom
[26:12] I also had a life
[26:35] Arham you!
[26:37] come in dear
[26:39] No Fabiha, do not proceed further
[26:45] what shall I say?
[26:48] I don't have words
[26:53] I have fallen so much in my own eyes today that...
[27:01] I had shown you respect at the same doorstep, do you remember?
[27:05] Do you remember when you were crying and the entire neighborhood was watching? That's when I held your hand
[27:13] and you ruined my house
[27:17] destroyed me
[27:21] I thought you loved my kids and would take care of my mother
[27:27] I also thought that you are in love with me
[27:32] Arham, listen to me
[27:34] don't take my name
[27:37] absolutely not!
[27:40] what was my fault?
[27:44] Just that when you needed me the most, I fulfilled your need.
[27:47] I supported you
[27:53] And there is no need to say anything more to you because I am the culprit; I have destroyed my family
[27:58] today my children are not mine, my wife is not mine
[28:02] I am a stranger in my own house
[28:04] only because of you!
[28:07] just remember one thing, Fabiha
[28:10] I won't let your shadow fall on this baby
[28:14] I don't want this baby to know who her mother was
[28:17] don't say this, please Arham
[28:20] Arham
[28:21] Arham, where are you going? Listen to me
[28:24] mom, he is leaving me. Please stop him
[28:27] Arham!
be careful dear...
[28:29] Arham, listen to me. He said, he'll take away my baby from me
[28:33] No... 
mom
[28:37] enough Fabiha, please
[28:39] be careful, don't worry if God willing everything will be fine
[28:45] everything is finished, mom
[28:48] how can he leave me alone? Please stop him
ok
[28:54] he said, he will take away my baby from me
[28:57] don't let this happen, ok?
Please stop him
[29:02] One has to face the consequences of their mistakes, dear
[29:06] I used to teach you the difference between right and wrong since your childhood
[29:10] but you guys had never listened to your mother
[29:14] now look at the consequences
[29:16] Mom, how the situation and circumstances took over my patience that I couldn't understand anything
[29:22] it happens like this, dear
[29:24] we get so involved in the luxuries of this world
[29:27] that we forget ourselves
[29:31] we trade our after life
[29:36] Look...
[29:38] I am trying to make you understand today as well
[29:41] you are about to become a mother
[29:43] A mother can relate to another mother
[29:47] a lot of big mistakes do happen in a life
[29:51] but...
[29:52] If a person bends down a little and apologizes, then everything gets better
[29:59] a person doesn't become small in it
[30:04] in fact he becomes very big
[30:06] how will I be forgiven, mom?
[30:09] you can be forgiven, dear
[30:11] Look, we have faced a lot of difficulties
[30:16] I agree that you have handled this house very well
[30:21] You are complaining to me that I ousted you from my house
[30:26] it was just a little punishment for you
[30:30] and do you know, I kept calling your name in different alleys
[30:35] but I couldn't find you
[30:38] you are my child, dear
[30:41] only I know how I had been living without you
[30:48] but when I found you
[30:50] Your appearance was something different
[30:52] You ruined a family that can never be repaired
[30:59] and hey are still in difficulties
[31:02] have you ever thought
[31:04] what you did with Sanaya?
[31:07] do think about her
[31:11] how she must have made that house
[31:14] how she must have raised her kids
[31:17] how she would have served her husband
[31:21] You took away everything from her in a moment by entering her house
[31:28] the pain you are going through today
[31:31] try to realize her pain as well
[31:34] you had gone to her house as her husband's second wife
[31:38] and you know
[31:41] what do they consider a man's second wife in this society
[31:45] characterless!
[31:47] vile woman!
[31:50] how could you do all this, Fabiha?
[31:52] mom, I couldn't understand anything
[31:55] my baby...
[31:58] there is a way out
[32:00] apologize to Sanaya
[32:03] if she forgives you
[32:06] then everything will be fine & get better
[32:12] Apologize to Arham and Sanaya; it won't diminish your stature, in fact, you'll be respected more
[32:20] as far as your relation is concerned
[32:23] leave it on God
[32:26] He sees the intentions
[32:28] He know everything
[32:39] Okay Hareem, Hadi you don't have to annoy your mom at all. Ok?
[32:44] if you guys will annoy her then your uncle & aunty will be upset. Ok?
[32:48] don't take tension aunty, our mom & dad are with each other
[32:52] Hadi & I are so happy
[32:54] and do you know, we don't annoy mom at all
[32:57] All praise to God, this is so good. These kids are so nice
[33:03] Okay Sanaya, you have to take very good care of yourself
[33:07] and no matter what happens you don't have to hide it from us
[33:15] Look...
[33:19] your brother is going away from you
[33:21] though we are physically distant, but our hearts will always stay connected
[33:27] understand?
[33:29] no matter if there is any problem or so, just don't hide it from us
[33:34] I am just a call away from you, ok?
[33:39] I wont hide anything, brother
[33:42] besides, a lot has happened in my life that
[33:46] nothing is left to hide
[33:50] Sanaya, one needs to make space in order to achieve something in life or nurture anything
[34:00] Until yesterday, even your brother was not in favor of this relationship, but...
[34:06] he has also changed his decision for the sake of Hadi & Hareem
[34:12] You also need to give this relationship another chance by opening your heart
[34:21] Sanaya look..
[34:23] Somya is absolutely correct
[34:27] I would like you to give one more chance to Arham, for my sake
[34:33] Okay?
I know you are very brave
[34:40] shall we go now? As we'll get a lot of traffic on the way
[34:43] I will miss you guys a lot, do take very good care of yourself
[34:46] Sure, you guys also have to visit there. Okay?
[34:49] lets go
[34:50] Okay dear
[34:52] okay Sanaya, allow us to leave
[35:14] Sanaya...
Sanaya
[35:18] did you keep the expired milk in the fridge?
[35:20] No
why, what happened?
[35:22] you want to kill my un-born baby
[35:25] Fabiha had kept the milk, if you don't believe me then call her & ask
[35:29] why will she keep the milk?
then why would I keep it, Arham?
[35:31] because you are jealous of Fabiha & my unborn baby
[35:35] Arham, how can you even think of it?
I can think about anything
[35:39] I won't let you stay in this house until that baby is born, you won't live here
[35:44] so where will I go?
to your mom's house
[35:46] and that too right now. Lets go!
[35:49] Arham. Arham!
come...
[36:31] mom
[36:33] When will Dad come?
[36:37] I don't know. Please go to sleep now
[36:40] but I want to talk to dad right now
[36:43] my dear, we'll talk to him in the morning. Its very late night now, quickly go to sleep
[36:48] please mom, make me speak to him
[36:51] don't insist, one should listen to their mother. Ok?
[36:54] only one time
[36:57] don't insist, its a bad habit. Come on go to sleep
[36:59] go to sleep, just lye down. Once you'll lye down then you'll go to sleep
I am not sleepy
[37:07] mom is with you, quickly go to sleep. Close your eyes
[37:11] good girl!
[38:52] Fabiha
[38:53] dear, have your dinner. You haven't eaten anything since morning
[38:59] mom, I am not hungry
[39:02] and for whom I shall stay alive?
[39:05] I couldn't protect your honor
[39:08] neither I could keep my marriage intact
[39:11] What do you mean by 'for whom will you stay alive?'
[39:13] keep yourself composed, Fabiha
[39:16] See, our life doesn't stop if somebody leaves or arrives
[39:22] And don't be cruel to yourself or to this baby by staying hungry
[39:27] come on, let me feed my child with my own hands. Ok?
[39:32] eat little, my child
[39:36] here, in the name of Allah
[39:46] today I am realizing mom
[39:48] that a mother gives so much of sacrifices for their children
[39:52] Now look at yourself, you've started eating after hearing about your baby
[39:59] Then think about that mother who has endured so much for her children
[40:06] I made a mistake, mom
[40:09] But I will rectify this mistake by any means necessary, no matter what I have to do for it
[40:14] If intentions are pure, then the destination becomes easier to reach
[40:19] But Arham's love has become my only desire, mom
[40:27] its sister's call
[40:28] take it, check what is she saying
[40:31] hello, yes sister?
[40:36] why Hamza is calling me?
[40:40] yes Hamza?
[40:42] actually, Arham sir...
[40:45] what's the matter Hamza, why are you so worried?
[40:47] he had an accident
[40:51] what!
[40:53] yes, and I am sending you the pin location. Try to come to the hospital as soon as you can
[40:58] ok, I am coming in a while
