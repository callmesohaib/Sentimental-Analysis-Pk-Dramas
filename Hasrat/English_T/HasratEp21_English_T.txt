[01:01] I know all that why you are worried
[01:04] Such a big incident had happened in your life, and you couldn't tell Sister Fabiha
[01:09] because she is not attending your call, right?
[01:14] I am your sister
[01:16] I know you very well that until you won't tell your issues to sister Fabiha. you won't be relieved
[01:25] what shall I do, Aliya
[01:28] I have become habitual of her, along with her love
[01:32] and you think that all this is right?
[01:36] I have gone too far from the decision of right or wrong
[01:42] now I just keep on thinking, how to keep her happy and how to take care of her
[01:48] its difficult
[01:51] anyways, listen to me & try to hang out with your friends
[01:54] If you spend time with them, your habits will change, and you'll also enjoy your life more
[02:20] look at Sanaya, she is an ordinary looking girl but she is living in luxuries after marrying Arham
[02:25] why can't you live in luxuries then?
[02:27] how do you find Arham?
[03:20] where were you?
[03:24] yes?
[03:25] I am asking you, where were you?
[03:27] Actually I was... 
[03:29] I was inside the washing area
[03:31] I went to put Sir Arham's clothes on the line, as I had washed them in the morning
[03:34] Okay, I thought maybe you had forgotten your phone here. You were getting a call from Hamza
[03:41] still you are getting his call, pick it up. There might be some emergency
[03:44] pick it
[03:49] hello Hamza
[03:52] thank God that you have received the phone, I have been trying to call you since so long
[04:01] Hamza, I will call you back after going home. Bye!
[04:32] what are you doing here? Do you want something?
[04:35] No, I don't want anything. Actually I am going to the market, do let me know if you need anything
[04:39] No, I don't need anything but do ask Fabiha if she needs mom's insulin
[04:44] yes, okay
[05:06] Fabiha, come.. let me drop you
[05:09] No, its ok I will manage
[05:10] please, I insist. Come, let me drop you. Please
[05:14] Okay
[05:29] I'm sorry, today you were about to get caught because of me
[05:32] No no, I should be saying thanks to you
[05:35] because today, you had saved me from Sanaya
[05:38] otherwise, I would have opened the door by thinking that Sanaya will believe on my words
[05:43] anyways, thank God that we got saved from this situation
[05:46] honestly speaking... 
[05:49] I got scared for a bit
[05:52] you get scared as well?
[05:54] obviously! Every husband is scared of his wife
[05:58] hmm... 
[05:59] true that
[06:09] here comes your house
[06:11] please come inside, drink tea
[06:13] No no, next time. Thank you!
[06:16] Okay, bye!
[06:48] hey... 
[06:49] enough of this work
[06:57] what are your plans?
[07:00] I thought to clear all your complaints today
[07:12] coffee
[07:20] hmm... 
[07:43] Sanaya, your phone
[07:46] oh!
[07:49] Arham, its a call from my office
[07:51] I'm so sorry
[07:52] I am coming in just 2 minutes, Ok?
[07:56] hello!
[07:58] yes
[08:04] coffee
[10:01] Arham
[10:06] Arham, wake up
[10:11] Arham
[10:16] Arham
[10:17] switch off the lights & go to sleep
[10:19] I have to go to the office tomorrow morning
[10:35] honestly speaking, I would have made you my daughter-in-law. As I like you so much
[10:41] Does Sir Arham also like me?
[10:44] If my luck had given me a chance, would I have become the daughter-in-law of that house in reality?
[10:50] Won't the walls of status be higher for me?
[10:55] why life does this with us?
[10:58] The path which is closed leads to the destination
[11:12] Fabiha
[11:17] Fabiha
[11:19] in which thoughts you are lost?
[11:23] nothing, I was thinking about you
[11:25] I am worried
[11:28] that's a different matter
[11:30] but... right now you rare hiding your worries in my worries
[11:35] its not like that, sister
[11:38] If it were in my control, I would have kept all the happiness of this world at your feet
[11:46] now I have accepted whatever is written in my fate
[11:51] no happiness of this world can lessen this grief of mine, Fabiha
[12:14] Speak up
[12:16] Fabiha, actually you had said to me that you'll call me back
[12:20] But maybe you had forgotten; that's why I had called you myself
[12:23] tell me, I am listening
[12:26] Fabiha, I've been fired from my job
[12:33] and I have to pay 10 lac rupees within 2 months time, else they will file a case against me
[12:39] and how will you pay such a hefty amount?
[12:42] I have to sell the house
[12:48] Fabiha, why are you quiet?
[12:56] Hello?
[13:03] a person who doesn't even have a job of 50,000 rupees
[13:07] how will he take care of your responsibility, Fabiha?
[13:10] Today, he lost his job
[13:12] tomorrow, he will loose his house
[13:14] what will Hamza be left to give me?
[13:21] Hadi, how am I drawing?
[13:22] very nice
[13:23] you are also making very nice
[13:30] hmm... its looking really good
[13:32] Wow! You've made it very nicely
[13:35] what is this happening?
[13:36] I had made you guys sleep, so what is happening now?
[13:39] Mom, we are making friendship cards for Fabiha aunty
[13:43] as its a friend's day tomorrow
[13:52] how is it, mom?
[13:54] its nice
[13:58] mom, do you know. Fabiha aunty has become our best friend
[14:02] Do both of you like Aunt Fabiha?
[14:06] very much!
yes
[14:08] hmm... 
[14:10] what do you like about Fabiha aunty?
[14:12] she plays with us
[14:14] she feeds us the food from her hands
[14:17] your mother also do that
[14:21] mom
[14:24] you only feed us on Sunday
[14:26] rest of the days you are busy in office
[14:33] mom, now tell me how does it look?
[14:36] and Hadi.. look at Hadi's. Is this some drawing? So bad
[14:41] huh!
[14:45] Enough now!
[14:46] no mom, please mom...
enough!
[14:49] Hareem
[14:50] pack this all
[14:54] come on now, go to sleep. Leave it
[16:04] honestly speaking, I would have made you my daughter-in-law. As I like you so much
[17:49] you are looking pretty
[17:53] just like that
[17:56] Hamza has come; he is waiting for you outside
[18:00] Hamza?
[18:04] and where is mom?
[18:06] she is also sitting with him, waiting
[18:13] I have to go with Hamza if I go outside
[18:19] Fabiha, if you don't want to go with him then go & clearly refuse
[18:25] what's there to be scared about?
[18:29] As it is, one needs to be a bit rebellious in order to make a few decisions in life
[18:35] its better to tell him off once, instead of making excuses on daily basis
[18:43] what are you thinking now? Go, tell him
[18:58] hey, you had asked me for this shirt at night
[19:01] you hardly have time for me, that's why I have pressed it myself
[19:06] Arham
[19:08] I'm so sorry for the last night
[19:12] there is no need to apologize, I understand
[19:15] Arham, Arham... please, I know why you are upset with me. I try to end my work at office
[19:21] but its a job, and eventually I get some work or the other
[19:23] please try to understand
[19:25] its your duty to manage it, the work as well as the house
[19:27] that's why I was saying that I shall leave the job
[19:30] why do you tell me about the job again & again? Are you doing any favor on me?
[19:33] No no, please there isn't any such thing. You are taking me wrong
[19:37] I am considering it right
[19:39] even your family isn't happy, since I got a promotion
[19:43] also your thinking got changed
[19:46] there isn't any such thing, in fact my mother was so happy to hear about your promotion
[19:50] I know she must have given you this suggestion of leaving the job as well
[19:52] Stop it please! Where are you taking this matter?
[19:55] I am just trying to know the truth
[19:57] The truth is that my family hasn't said anything. Whether to leave or continue the job will be my own choice.
[20:02] and you don't want to me to leave the job, so end of discussion
[20:05] the discussion is not ended. Not at all!
[20:08] I need to find out
[20:12] Arham
[20:21] why, what happened?
[20:23] Sanaya, just answer me about whatever I am asking
did you gave an insulin shot to mom last night or not?
[20:28] yes, I did
[20:29] stop it Sanaya, how much more you'll lie?
[20:32] every time you falsify my mother
[20:34] one carelessness after another, there is a limit of everything!
[20:37] Arham!
[20:38] Thank God that Fabiha came on the right time, else don't know what would have happened
[20:41] let me tell you one thing
[20:44] if anything happened to my mother
[20:46] then nobody will be as bad as me
[20:54] yes yes, everything is fine at home
[20:56] and then, I have you & mom along with your prayers. So what kind of a tension then?
[21:01] Fabiha, dear come quickly. Hamza is here to pick you
[21:07] shall we go, Fabiha?
[21:12] no
[21:16] what do you mean by no?
[21:19] I will go myself, mom
[21:22] Fabiha, let me drop you
[21:24] Hamza, sop worrying about me & worry about your job. Because you need it more
[21:31] Job? Why... have you lost your job?
[21:35] Yes, Mom, they have fired him from the job due to embezzlement and fined him 10 lakh rupees
[21:43] Embezzlement
[21:44] I can't believe that Hamza would have done any embezzlement
[21:50] mom, nothing will happen by your advocacy
[21:52] he doesn't have a job, yet there are many expenses & responsibilities
[21:56] and then in order to drop me he needs to spend on the petrol too
[21:59] I cannot become a burden on him anymore, therefore I will go myself
[22:02] Bye!
[22:05] Fabiha
Fabiha wait
[22:15] Fabiha wait...
Fabiha
[22:17] Fabiha wait...
Fabiha, listen to me
[22:56] Greetings!*
[23:24] Fabiha
[23:26] yes maam
[23:27] please check on the kids lunch today, as I will get a bit late
[23:30] and do leave a bit late, until Hadi doesn't comes back from his Karate class
[23:33] he takes a shower after coming back from his class, I have kept his clothes
[23:36] rest you can see
[23:54] here you go, dear
[23:55] drink some water
[24:00] did you talk to Mr. Jamal?
[24:03] what did he said about the money?
[24:08] for now, we don't have any other option than selling this house
[24:14] dear, its such an old house built on 700 sq feet
[24:18] in what amount it will get sold?
[24:20] and then you'll pay them 10 lac rupees, what will we be left with?
[24:25] I have to get you married in the future, as well as Hania
[24:29] dear, we need to take the decisions wisely not emotionally
[24:33] mom, I am trying my best that this house shall not get sold
[24:39] but if we cannot find any other way out then
[24:42] we have to take this step
[24:47] there is one solution
[24:51] what is the solution, mom?
[24:53] The house where Fabiha works, they are quite a rich family
[24:57] if you will talk to them
[24:59] then they'll give you & then we'll return them on monthly basis
[25:03] what are you saying, mom? What's wrong with you?
[25:06] how can I take money from Fabiha?
[25:09] my self-respect doesn't allow me to ask for the money from my to-be wife
[25:14] there isn't any harm in it though
[25:17] dear, a life is spent in the same manner by living together
[25:20] mom, you must be thinking this way
[25:22] but why Fabiha will marry such a person, who is living on her earning?
[25:29] she is my responsibility, I am not her responsibility!
[25:32] dear, even you had given many sacrifices for Fabiha
[25:36] and the relations becomes strong by giving sacrifices
[25:39] at least try talking to her
[25:47] listen to me & talk to her
[27:06] aunty, I've brought your tea 
[27:11] aunty
[27:14] aunty, get up. Its quite late now
[27:20] aunty, why your hand is...
you are so cold
[27:25] aunty
[27:27] what happened, aunty?
[27:30] tell me
[27:32] aunty, open your mouth
[27:35] aunty
[27:36] say something
[27:39] aunty you... 
oh!
[27:41] aunty is really not well
[27:54] hello!
[27:55] Sir Arham, aunty is very sick. What shall I do?
[28:01] what happened to mom?
[28:03] she is not giving any response, she is not opening her mouth or eyes
[28:07] she is not talking, what shall I do?
[28:10] I think her sugar got low. Give her an insulin shot along with a bread slice
[28:13] I am coming
[28:16] insulin?
Okay
[28:35] aunty, I have given you an insulin shot. Soon, you will be fine
[28:42] aunty
[28:44] try to drink some water, here
[28:47] aunty
[28:48] you will be completely fine if you will drink water
[28:52] yes, okay
[28:57] Did you have dinner last night?
[29:00] hmm... 
[29:01] Did you have dinner last night?
[29:03] I don't know
[29:05] Did you take your insulin shot?
[29:06] No
[29:08] No, I did not
[29:10] let me bring something for you to eat. You will get better after eating it, Ok?
[29:16] let me bring toast for you
[29:21] Greetings!
[29:22] your mother is not well, she is resting
[29:27] mom! What happened, why are you lying like this?
[29:30] Hadia...
[29:32] I think they forgot to give her an insulin shot last night and dinner as well. Just now I have given her an insulin shot
[29:37] its sister Sanaya's responsibility to give her an insulin shot at night
[29:44] I am bringing something for you to eat right away. Ok?
[30:02] yes Hadia?
[30:03] brother, where are you?
[30:05] I am going home, as mom..
do you know about mom's condition?
[30:10] Your wife was given only one responsibility: to give insulin shots to Mom at night, and she isn't even doing that
[30:15] its not like that Hadia
[30:18] it cannot happen that Sanaya had missed her night insulin
[30:21] really! So am I lying? Have you seen mom's condition?
[30:25] you might have complete trust on your wife, but I don't!
[30:30] that poor Fabiha is way better than her, at least she care about our mother
[30:34] I must say, whatever amount you pay her increase it & give her the responsibility of night's insulin as well
[30:40] at least our mother will stay alive
[30:42] tell me, it will become our desire to see our mother alive
[30:46] Hadia, I am just going home. I will talk to you later
[30:49] quickly go, And I won't tolerate any single carelessness in my mom's matter
[30:59] ok dear, its enough
[31:01] I am fine now
[31:03] now you may go & look after your other work, Ok?
[31:06] absolutely not! You are most important right now
[31:10] we can do the other work later
[31:14] how are you feeling now?
[31:15] thank God dear, I am fine now
[31:19] until she is here
[31:21] until then nothing will happen to me
[31:24] its just that you have to be thankful to her for your entire life
[31:29] today, your mother is alive because of her
[31:32] otherwise...
[31:35] Sanaya hadn't left any chance to kill me
[31:40] Mom, didn't Sanaya give you an insulin shot at night?
[31:46] She might have not given me dinner as well
[31:52] Maybe she had forgotten to give her an insulin shot due to her office tension
[32:06] I don't understand, how will Hamza return such a hefty amount
[32:12] Mom, he has to return the money if he has stolen them
[32:17] Farheen
[32:19] I can't believe that Hamza can do any such thing
[32:23] oh mom! he won't tell you before doing it
[32:26] They might have gotten some proof against him; that's why they fired him from such a long-term job
[32:31] remember one thing
[32:33] A naive person is one who never got any chance
[32:38] how can Hamza do this? He is such a pious guy
[32:43] Even I used to consider Haris so pious, the way you think about Hamza
[32:47] But don't get deceived like me
[32:50] Fabiha's life is at stake and ten lacs is not a small amount
[32:56] No
[32:58] Hamza cannot deceive
[33:02] by the way mom, these peas are very sweet
[33:05] don't eat uncooked, else it will give you a stomachache
[33:08] don't worry sir, I have sent the quotation along with the map
[33:11] Okay, thank you!
[33:12] excuse me, sir
[33:14] yes yes, sure
[33:20] yes Arham?
[33:21] Sanaya, did you gave an insulin shot to mom last night?
[33:24] why, what happened?
[33:25] Sanaya, just answer me about whatever I am asking
did you gave an insulin shot to mom last night or not?
[33:30] yes, I did
[33:32] stop it Sanaya, how much more you'll lie?
[33:35] every time you falsify my mother
[33:37] one carelessness after another, there is a limit of everything!
[33:40] Arham!
[33:40] Thank God that Fabiha came on the right time, else don't know what would have happened
[33:43] let me tell you one thing
[33:46] if anything happened to my mother
[33:49] then nobody will be as bad as me
[33:52] don't you believe my words?
[33:54] you've lost this trust yourself
[33:56] and my mother is also right
[33:57] a woman who doesn't have time to give me, how will she take care of my mother!
[34:02] Arham...
[34:23] yes sir
[34:24] everything is ok?
[34:26] yes sir, everything is fine
[34:29] So sir, I was telling you that I have sent the quotation as well as the map
[34:34] as soon as I will get any reply from their side, I will let you know
[34:36] Ok
[34:37] mom, you had scared me
[34:40] I thought you are really very sick
[34:43] oh God!
[34:45] mom, there is no use of your dramas
[34:48] it will be beneficial Hadia, for sure
[34:52] let me see until when Ms. Sanaya will feel proud of her luck
[34:57] and this time, I've decided
[34:59] I will ensure to remove her from Arham's life
[35:03] its not so easy, mom
[35:05] brother Arham is completely in his wife's control
[35:08] and no matter what you do, you can snatch a husband from a wife but...
[35:12] you cannot snatch a father from their children
[35:14] brother Arham will always stay as a shared person
[35:17] and now, how can you think that any girl would like to enter in the life of a shared person?
[35:22] By the way, I shouldn't be saying this but...
[35:26] If you want to use any girl to distance Brother Arham from his wife
[35:31] and get him married, then that girl should have some caliber.
[35:37] I've seen Fabiha
[35:39]  She is just good-looking; she doesn't have any other qualities
[35:43] Hadia, you are talking about marriage, but I haven't thought about any such thing.
[35:48] what do you mean?
[35:49] I mean, we just need to set up a trap
[35:54] the way we use to catch fish, so now...
[35:57] the actual motive is to remove Sanaya from Arham's life, nothing else
[36:02] I see...
[36:05] wow mom! You are so far-sighted
[36:09] I swear, I haven't thought about so far though
[36:14] Okay, tell me, even if Fabiha agreed by any means, then how will you bring her close to Brother Arham?
[36:20] we just need to provoke a man's nature, he melts down like an ice
[36:26] And what about the time when it comes to separating them?
[36:30] we'll see that later
[36:33] you may see that mom
[36:35] What if your conspiracy turns against you and we get into trouble?
[36:38] right now the only possible solution of our problems is Fabiha
[36:44] I am waiting for that time
[36:47] when Arham & Fabiha will come closer
[36:53] Fabiha
[36:57] Fabiha, come in dear. Come on
[37:02] okay then, bye!
[37:04] please come dear, sit down
[37:18] Have you heard my discussion with Hadia?
[37:23] No, I haven't heard anything
[37:28] ok, look here
[37:32] now tell me
[37:35] you haven't heard anything?
[37:39] its not possible
[37:41] why?
[37:44] why its not possible? Everything is possible, if you want. Nothing is impossible
[37:52] and why do you want this to happen?
[38:01] A mother, whose son lives a suffocating life in front of her on a daily basis
[38:05] and in order to make his wife & children happy
[38:11] he has forgotten to smile
[38:15] if his mother...
[38:18] wants to see him smiling, & bring back his happiness then what's wrong in it?
[38:25] tell me!
[38:27] is second marriage a sin?
[38:35] and what problem do you have?
[38:37] everything is here, whatever you want from life
[38:41] we have a house, cars, wealth..
[38:46] you have my support
[38:52] you are in search of a destination
[38:56] And my son is in search of happiness
[39:01] the destination is here, the happiness is here
[39:06] its just...
[39:10] we need to make the right decision on the right time
[39:18] Understand?
[39:23] and what about Arham
[39:26] a man makes a decision upon a woman's intention
[39:33] and what Arham wants
[39:35] nobody knows that better than me
[39:38] I am here
[39:41] you just have to take action
