[02:32] take your medicines, mom
[02:39] The mothers who are relieved from their children's side
[02:44] The medicines effect only those
[02:48] if you don't have the relieve from your children side
[02:52] then these medicines aren't effective at all
[02:55] mom, a mother's prayer is the guarantee of her children peace
[03:00] keep praying, & see if God wills everything will be better
[03:05] I pray to God, may God give some sense to Sanaya
[03:13] we cannot end the relations being so emotional
[03:20] how shall I explain her?
[03:22] I am a mother, & being a mother I never want her family to get ruined
[03:28] mom, Sanaya is not ruining her family but brother Arham is
[03:34] and mom, when he doesn't want Sanaya to live in his house then how can Sanaya live there?
[03:43] mom, not only Sanaya but no woman will tolerate it. Not even me
[03:51] I am having severe headache
[03:54] ok mom, don't take tension. Just keep praying, everything will be fine
[03:59] you should be relieved that Sanaya is with you right now
[04:04] whatever her decision is, we should support her mom
[04:08] and if you are being tensed that I will taunt her being her sister-in-law, then its nothing like that
[04:16] you are the most important person for me right now, & your health
[04:21] and what about these worries mom...
[04:24] everything will be fine with time, if God wills
[04:29] If the mothers-in-law don't conspire after marrying off their sons
[04:34] then every house will have a daughter-in-law like you my dear
[04:37] true mom
[04:39] You have never made me feel like you are my mother-in-law.
[04:42] then why shall I treat you like a daughter-in-law
[04:45] sit here
[05:23] earlier, I was thinking that you are worried because of Hadi
[05:30] but now I am realizing that you met Sanaya, that's why you are upset
[05:37] its not like that, Fabiha
[05:39] then what's the matter, Arham? You are not with me, even though you are with me
[05:48] what is my fault in all this?
[05:53] why are you doing injustice with me, Arham?
[05:55] your love, your companionship & your time. Everything is my right
[05:59] and you are taking away my right from me
[06:02] its not like that, Fabiha. I am just worried about the kids
[06:06] and what about the upcoming baby, don't you care about him?
[06:09] Fabiha, everything I did, I did for our upcoming baby
[06:15] I am nurturing our relation, I am taking care of you
[06:18] I not only want your companionship, Arham. I want to see you happy with me
[06:25] and I can't see that happiness on your face
[06:33] whatever Sanaya did with me, still I kept tolerating her in this house for your sake
[06:41] whether she lives in this house or not, but she'll always stay between us
[06:46] she is not between us
[06:52] she has finished everything with her own hands
[06:54] she has finished but you are still confused
[07:02] and if you'll keep confused in the same manner, then our relation will always stay weak
[07:09] And the day this fragile relationship breaks, only then will you be free from this matter
[07:18] I haven't made you alone, Arham but you are making me lonely
[07:23] you are taking me wrong
[07:25] you are forcing me to think this way
[07:28] ok sorry
[07:33] you are so emotional just like me
[07:36] you take everything to your heart, please...
[07:38] obviously
[07:40] ok, I am sorry
[07:44] I got lost in my life's issues, and couldn't give you time. So sorry
[07:53] today on wards, my life's 12 hours are yours
[07:56] promise?
[07:58] yes
[08:00] Okay, I forgave you
[08:08] by the way, I was thinking to invite my mother to my house today
[08:12] yes, why not?
[08:25] how was your exam?
[08:26] very nice & how was yours?
[08:28] mine was really good but I know yours didn't go well
[08:32] mine was also good & sister, please come with me
[08:37] you shall come with us Hadi, we'll enjoy a lot
[08:40] and mom had said, that she'll take us to the northern areas once our exams will be over
[08:47] to show the snowfall
[08:48] No, I will go with dad
[08:59] mom!
[09:04] mom... 
[09:06] yes my dear
[09:09] how is my son?
[09:13] Hareem, you go & sit in the car. I am coming
[09:19] how was your paper?
[09:21] very nice
[09:24] don't you miss your mom?
[09:25] even you are not missing me
[09:28] who said that mom doesn't miss you?
Mom misses you so much at all times
[09:33] Fabiha aunty had said
[09:38] ok mom wants you to come to your granny's house with her
[09:42] No, uncle is there
[09:46] uncle gets angry
[09:49] no my dear, uncle is very nice
[09:56] we don't say like that
[09:58] Fabiha aunty told me that you don't want to live with us
[10:04] no my dear
[10:05] Dad hasn't come to pick me up yet
[10:09] so come with me, we'll go to your granny's house
[10:12] but dad was saying that he'll come to pick me
[10:15] But Dad still hasn't come, and your mom can't leave you alone like this
[10:19] Everyone will leave, so my son will be afraid. Come with me
[10:22] won't you scold me?
[10:25] never my dear
[10:28] I will not scold my son at all
[10:30] Okay, lets go
[10:31] I will call dad, he will pick you from your granny's house. OK?
[10:35] Okay?
lets go! Let me hold this. Which ice cream my son would like to eat?
[10:40] yes?
Strawberry!
[10:42] Okay
[10:45] and which chocolate we shall buy for Hareem?
[10:47] um... Blueberry
[11:14] hello Fabiha! yes tell me
[11:16] hello, sister! where are you?
[11:19] I am at the mart with Hamza
[11:21] Okay, wait a minute & listen to me
[11:23] ok listen, I will talk to you later
[12:04] please call Hadi & Hareem
[12:08] Sir, madam took Hadi & Hareem with her
[12:13] when?
[12:14] just a while ago
[12:20] Okay
[12:49] did you show the home work to aunty?
Somya
[12:51] she liked it?
Somya
[12:53] yes mom
[12:54] Did Sanaya come back after picking up Hareem?
[12:57] Yes, Mom, Sanaya just went upstairs. She'll bring the kids down within ten minutes after they freshen up
[13:02] Hadi also came today
[13:04] really! its such a good thing
[13:06] ok listen, do one thing. He loves noodles, but spicy ones. Kindly make some
[13:12] Hadi
[13:14] Hadi!
[13:15] Arham, what happened? Where is Hadi?
Where is Hadi?
[13:18] I am asking where is Haid?
[13:20] Sanaya took the kids upstairs
[13:22] Hadi
[13:25] dad is here
[13:29] shall we go home?
[13:32] dad, mom said to me that I will call your dad here
[13:39] Why did you bring Hadi home from school?
[13:41] so what else I could have done?
[13:42] I should have left my son alone on the road?
[13:45] and I don't need your permission to bring Hadi
[13:47] Sanaya, you have to seek my permission!
[13:54] When I said Hadi would stay with me, that's it! He's coming with me
[13:59] lets go dear
[14:00] No
[14:02] you cannot snatch the children from a mother
[14:05] you are doing wrong with the kids, don't do this drama
[14:08] when its decided, then I will take Hadi & soon I will take Hareem as well
[14:13] I didn't ask you for anything, I am asking for Hadi Arham
[14:19] Sanaya, the kids will live with me so they will!
[14:24] No, you cannot take them. The kids will live with me, I cannot live without Hadi & Hareem
[14:34] Hadi is my son, and nobody can take better care of him than me. He is getting spoiled
[14:38] he is getting spoiled with you Sanaya, not with me!
[14:41] I am her mother, how can I think bad for him?
[14:43] and I am his father!
[14:45] do you think that I want bad for him?
[14:47] you are emotional, you always make wrong decisions emotionally
[14:50] You did injustice to me, and now you're doing the same with the kids. Are you trying to assert your power over me?
[14:55] Sanaya, you can think whatever you want to. He is my son & he will go with me
[14:59] No Hadi will not go anywhere, Hadi & Hareem will stay with me. I cannot live without them, you have everything
[15:04] a wife, an up coming baby. What will you get by taking away my peace from me?
[15:07] leave Hadi's hand!
[15:08] I won't leave
[15:10] Sanaya, don't insist & don't compel me. I will create a drama here!
[15:15] Fine! take him
[15:17] If you insist on this, then it will happen that way. I will seek custody of Hadi through the court
[15:23] and I will show you by taking it
[15:24] really!
[15:26] you don't need to go to the court then, let me end it right here by pronouncing only 3 words!
[15:33] are you scaring me? Are you threatening me?
[15:36] and do you think that I will be afraid of your threats?
[15:38] fine Arham, lets end this game of love right away
[15:43] lets bury this love by three words, divorce me right away
[15:48] Sanaya, come back to senses!
please mom, be quiet!
[15:51] I shall also see that how much he hates me & how low he can stoop. Divorce me!
[15:56] come back to your senses!
you really want to take a divorce?
[15:59] yes, I do. Divorce me!
[16:00] I, in my complete senses...
Arham! Arham.. 
[16:03] mom!
[17:07] hello mom!
[17:09] how are you?
[17:15] Since you have forgiven me, I feel so relieved now
[17:19] I am so happy that I can't tell you
[17:22] Fabiha, at least you are in peace
[17:27] but maybe your mother will get peace in her grave
[17:30] mom, what are you saying?
[17:35] ok leave these things, I have call to discuss an important matter with you
[17:39] yes tell me, what is it?
[17:41] I was actually thinking if you could do dinner at our house tonight?
[17:45] at your house or at your husband's first wife's house?
[17:49] mom...
[17:51] she is not here, and she is not my husband's first wife
[17:58] This is my house! When you come and see it, you'll keep looking at it
[18:06] I have ousted Sanaya from this house; now I'm the only one left to erase her from Arham's heart
[18:12] Fabiha, what's wrong with you? Since when you've started to ruin others family?
[18:18] oh mom...
[18:20] A life is spent with money
[18:26] The truth is, I didn't marry Arham just for money
[18:35] I truly like him, I love him from my heart. I cannot live without him
[18:41] a man never forgets his first wife, remember that
[18:47] also she is his children mother too
[18:50] Mom, the day is not far when I will also bring the happiness of a baby to Arham
[18:55] Fabiha, I don't feel like I'm talking to the same Fabiha who was my daughter
[19:03] Okay, whatever lecture you want to give me, you can come and give it to me here. Okay?
[19:06] you are coming here, & I am getting the dinner ready
[19:10] I will send the location to Sister Farheen, and I will also send the driver. So don't worry
[19:15] okay?
[19:16] okay, we'll see. Bye!
[20:02] Farheen, come sit in the car
[20:05] No Hamza, I will go myself why are you bothering yourself for me?
[20:09] Why are you insisting now? Your anger has also subsided
[20:14] come, please sit. What is the problem now in sitting with me?
[20:19] do you want me to sit with you?
[20:22] Farheen, I don't understand the depth of your words
[20:26] don't change the path the day you'll understand it
[20:29] Ok fine, I won't change. Now please sit
[20:45] by the way shall I ask something?
[20:48] I know what you want to ask.
You want to ask about Fabiha, right?
[20:52] How can you understand what's in my heart? Fabiha never used to understand anything; I had to explain everything to her
[20:59] When we establish a heartfelt connection with someone, words are not necessary to understand each other
[21:06] means?
[21:07] Nothing! As far as Fabiha is concerned, I couldn't talk to her yesterday
[21:12] I was busy making the report, so she talked to mom, but yes...
[21:16] I only know that she is a bit unwell
[21:22] shall we go now?
[21:24] yes, lets go
[22:01] your dialed number is not answering
[22:17] your dialed number is not answering
[23:34] mom
[23:43] its time to take her 
[23:49] No no.. please no brother
[23:54] mom...
brother
[23:56] Tell Mom that I will do whatever she asks me to do
[24:00] I will go back to my house, I will listen to her. I won't hurt her, ask her to wake up
[24:05] Sanaya
[24:06] wake up, mom...
please don't cry
[24:20] tell mom to wake up, I will listen to whatever she'll say to me
[24:24] she cannot leave me like this
[24:27] how will I live without my mother?
[25:00] Sanaya, please control yourself
[25:01] move away!
[25:06] You have made this woman's daughter helpless
[25:17] Today, you want to do a favor for me and my mother by shouldering the same woman's dead body?
[25:28] Even if there is a lack of shoulders in this world, I will do it myself
[25:38] I won't take your favor!
[25:43] Sanaya please
[25:46] brother, please... you cannot take mom
[25:49] you cannot take my mother, no brother
[27:00] wow mom! This house is so big
[27:04] your daughter has become a millionaire
[27:06] now don't talk too much in front of Arham, Ok?
keep your mouth shut
[27:10] Mom, I've always seen such big houses from the outside,
[27:13]  but it has always been my heart's desire to see them from the inside
[27:16] come, lets go inside...
dear... 
[27:18] We cannot light our makeshift shelter on fire just because we see someone's palace
[27:29] mom
[27:31] I can't believe that how big this house is
[27:33] and look at our house
[27:35] ok enough
[27:38] Fabiha must be inside, shall I check?
[27:42] hey, where are you going?
Farheen
[27:46] at least listen to me
[27:49] Fabiha
[27:51] Fabiha
[27:55] Fabiha...
[28:01] how are you?
[28:02] absolutely fine, how about you?
[28:03] I am absolutely fine
[28:04] Fabiha, your house is so big that you can do a lot of functions here
[28:09] where is mom?
[28:10] she is outside
[28:22] greetings mom!
[28:24] greetings! Stay blessed & happy
[28:26] give it to me
[28:27] Jabbar
[28:31] take it inside
[28:35] I am feeling so happy to see you in my house, mom
[28:40] the house is really good
[28:42] Not only is this house good, but Arham is also very good. He takes very good care of me
[28:46] by the way, where is Arham?
[28:47] He has gone out for some office work; he will be back in a while
[28:51] Fabiha, your house is so big. Don't you feel scared being alone?
[28:56] Why be scared? It's my own house, and Arham is here with me now... 
[29:00] and now a baby is about to come as well, so we are decorating his room upstairs
[29:04] All praise to God, a person should have a fate like yours
[29:10] love, care, big house, cars... you have got everything
[29:21] and here I am, neither I got love nor fate
[29:30] sister, why do you think this way?
[29:36] Whoever does wrong has to face its consequences
[29:39] and whatever brother Haris did, for sure he will have to face its consequences
[29:46] and you will also get the star of your fate
[29:56] Greetings!
[29:59] stay blessed
[30:00] please come, lets go inside
[30:02] No, I am going upstairs
[30:19] Fabiha, what happened? Arham seems angry. I hope he didn't mind our visit
[30:24] No no, actually he is tired nothing else. Please come inside
[31:16] Sanaya
[31:18] I am bringing food for you
[31:20] come, eat something first
[31:23] I am not hungry sister, take it away
[31:35] lets go Sanaya
[31:37] The men are back from the burial ritual
[31:44] Junaid was also saying that the funral food is first fed to the daughter & daughter-in-law of the house
[31:53] please eat, so that we can serve it to the rest of the guests as well
[32:00] everything got snatched away, sister
[32:07] husband, kids... mother
[32:16] I will never forgive Arham & Fabiha
[32:19] leave everything on God
[32:21] He is the better planner, ok?
[32:27] people say it right
[32:33] The grief of a daughter takes the life of her parents
[32:41] don't say such things, Sanaya
[32:47] mom wasn't feeling well since morning
[32:53] She was just worried about your decision, nothing else
[33:02] I took my mom's life
[33:09] I tolerated everything, sister
[33:14] Arham's second marriage, my distance from my children... everything
[33:19] I kept tolerating everything quietly upon my mom's orders
[33:23] I wanted to become a good child
[33:25] Tell me, what could I have done? When Arham ousted me from my house, where should I have gone, sister?
[33:30] daughters doesn't have any other place than her parents house
[33:39] everyone...
[33:42] everyone will call be a bad person now
[33:45] brother will find me a sinner, what will he think about me?
[33:50] nobody will consider you as a sinner
[33:53] don't you know your brother?
[33:56] don't think this way Sanaya, what's wrong?
[34:02] A maika (parents house) exists because of the parents, sister
[34:05] if they are not there then..
[34:11] I know maika (parents house) exists because of the parents
[34:17] But aren't your brother and sister-in-law still alive?
[34:25] When your mom had never treated me as a daughter-in-law then...
[34:29] why shall I consider you as a sister-in-law?
[34:31] you are my sister
[34:49] come, show some courage
[34:51] will mom like that you'll stay hungry?
[34:58] mom won't be happy like this, Sanaya
[35:01] come on, lets go
[35:04] come on, good girl. Show some courage & come with me
[35:09] Will Mom like it if you haven't had your lunch?
[35:12] come, lets go
[35:15] shall I bring the food here?
[35:47] Are you threatening me?
[35:48] and do you think that I will be afraid of your threats?
fine Arham!
[35:52]  lets end this game of love right away
[35:56] lets bury this love by three words
[36:10] divorce me right away
[36:11] Sanaya, come back to senses!
please mom, be quiet!
[36:14] I shall also see that how much he hates me & how low he can stoop. Divorce me!
[36:19] ,come back to your senses!
you really want to take a divorce?
[36:22] yes, I do. Divorce me!
[36:23] I, in my complete senses...
Arham! Arham..
[36:26] mom!
[36:50] You have made this woman's daughter helpless
[37:00] Today, you want to do a favor for me and my mother by shouldering the same woman's dead body?
[37:26] Even if there is a lack of shoulders in this world, I will do it myself
[37:33] I won't take your favor!
[38:51] mom gave her life
[38:56] she wanted to save me from getting the divorce
[39:01] My love has left me out of nowhere, brother
[39:10] our mother died, Sanaya
[39:20] our griefs took away her life
[39:30] parents await their children's happiness in their old age
[39:41] But my fate took a toll on her in her old age
[39:54] she couldn't tolerate it
[40:03] that's why I never wanted to bother her
[40:15] how will we spend our life without her?
[40:24] she never did anything bad for anyone
[40:32] nor she wanted anything bad for anyone
[40:36] then why my mom was treated so badly, brother?
