[01:05] Greetings mom.
[01:08] Mom, get up.
[01:10] I have brought tea for you.
[01:12] Please get up quickly. First I have to inject insulin then you can take tea.
[01:16] Don't do it now. Come after half an hour.
[01:20] It would be better to inject now.
[01:25] I don't want to take tea now. Go, don't you have any other thing to do?
[01:29] Mom, please let me inject insulin.
[01:30] I have to make breakfast for children and I also have to go to office. I will get late.
[01:42] What the hell? She has to go to office that's why she wants everyone to act upon her advises.
[02:29] Good morning sir.
[02:47] Right sir, as soon as client's flight from Dubai is confirmed, I will line up the meeting.
[02:50] Don't worry sir, we will get this project. God willing.
[02:58] Sanaya. Sanaya
[03:00] OK sir, I will call you back.
[03:02] I am coming.
[03:06] I am coming.
[03:09] Sanaya
[03:11] Sanaya
[03:15] Sanaya
[03:18] Sanaya
Yes.
[03:22] What's the matter? Why are you shouting?
[03:24] Look at this, the button of my shirt is loose. Please press any other shirt.
Why do you do this?
[03:28] There is no need to press other shirt, let me fix the button.
[03:35] How is Hareem feeling now?
[03:39] She is feeling good. She had no fever in the morning.
[03:41] She is sleeping now so I didn't check again.
Thank God otherwise I would be thinking about her all day long.
[03:47] You know, I also don't want to go.
[03:49] But there is a very important important meeting otherwise I wouldn't have gone by leaving my daughter.
Well that's their granny's house.
[03:55] She has been taking care of them and by the way your sister-in-law is also there so don't worry.
[03:59] Yes but sister-in-law also have her own children and on top of that our children as well.
Yes but we don't have any other option
[04:05] Mom's health is not good and she can't take care of children.
I know. I know.
[04:10] It's fixed.
[04:12] Come downstairs quickly, breakfast is ready. OK?
[04:16] And where are my socks?
[04:18] Your socks are there, you know about that.
[04:21] Listen
[04:24] I love you.
I hate you.
[04:27] I know that you lie.
[04:45] It's not in the bag and not there.
[04:54] That may be in there.
[05:03] Not here as well.
[05:08] I gave that to mom. Let me check the closet.
[05:32] Mom puts everything here.
[05:38] It's my mistake. I put things at one place but search those at other place.
[05:45] It's too late but Hamza didn't come. I will be late.
[05:50] Get ready quickly.
Just wait for a second my dear.
[05:54] Tell me what are you doing?
Fighting.
Fighting.
[05:59] But fighting is not a good thing to do. Just look up.
[06:04] Just look up my dear. Yeah.
[06:07] We won't do fighting. We are good children so we will get ready and go to school. Right?
[06:15] Kiss mama.
[06:16] My dear child.
[06:18] Hareem, get up. Hurry up.
[06:20] Come on get up my child. Aren't you in a mood to go to school?
[06:24] Hareem, what's the matter my child
[06:26] She has fever.
I am in so much pain.
[06:30] I am so much pain.
[06:33] Take a bit.
[06:36] What happened to my dear daughter? Why have you got such a high fever.
[06:38] I am in so much pain.
[06:40] You are feeling pain. Mom will give you medicine and my dear princess will be alright.
[06:48] Such a high fever.
[06:50] Why have you got this fever? Come to me my dear daughter.
[06:56] Mom.
[07:02] Mom.
[07:08] Mom
[07:14] Greetings.
Greetings.
[07:18] What are you doing here?
[07:20] I am making tea.
[07:22] I will make a cup of tea then I will take tea after injecting insulin then I will have a good day.
[07:27] Didn't Sanaya give you tea?
[07:30] What else Sanaya will do?
[07:33] Will she take care of her children, you, her office or this house?
[07:38] Let her set free from her mother-in-law's responsibility. Just leave if she couldn't give me tea.
But why, it's her responsibility.
[07:44] You should have asked her, she would make tea for you.
[07:48] You listen to me, it's enough for me.
[07:52] Just leave it, you won't do anything. Come with me.
[07:57] Ayan.
Sit here, let me ask her.
[08:00] It's only about a cup of tea. Don't do that. There will be an argument for no reason early morning.
[08:05] Sanaya
[08:07] Sanaya
[08:09] Mom will give medicine to her princess and you will be absolutely fine.
[08:13] Don't worry my dear.
[08:15] How is Hareem feeling now?
[08:17] Did her fever go down? I have been praying for her all night long.
She is feeling better.
[08:21] She is better. Right?
[08:23] Sanaya
[08:26] Mom is coming. OK
[08:28] Just get relax. I am coming. OK? You will be fine.
Hadi sit with her.
[08:35] I am coming. Take care of her.
[08:39] Hareem what happened to you?
[08:40] I have told her so many times to fold clothes, birds make these dirty.
[08:45] But she doesn't listen to me.
[08:50] Fabiha. Fabiha, are you ready?
[08:55] Fabiha, Fabiha, Fabiha. She only cares about her.
[08:58] She doesn't even think about me.
[08:59] I will keep waiting for my marriage in my mom's house. I will never get dowry nor get married.
[09:06] Stop murmuring.
[09:07] Make breakfast quickly.
[09:09] Yes, I am doing that.
[09:11] What else can I do except to feed all of you.
[09:17] Let me take that sister.
[09:19] Yes, hold it.
[09:20] Otherwise mom will be worried for entire day that her earning daughter went to office without eating.
[09:24] And I am sitting here like a burden.
There is nothing like that sister.
[09:28] And you don't have to worry, I will talk to mom about brother Haris.
[09:31] Fabiha, this matter is being discussed for the last five years, now the decision will be made, I am telling you. Go take your breakfast.
[09:43] Yes.
Sanaya you didn't give tea to mom. How can you forget to give her tea?
[09:48] I went to her Arham.
[09:50] But mom said that she wants to sleep then what would I do?
[09:53] What?
[09:55] When did you come to my room my child? I didn't know about that.
[09:59] I came to your room mom but you asked me to come after half an hour.
[10:03] A cup of tea was put near my bad but I thought that it was put there since last night so..
I am surprised that I didn't know about that.
[10:13] Believe me mom, I came to your room. Maybe you have forgotten.
[10:18] Yes maybe your are right.
[10:21] Anyways, sorry my child.
Mom, why are you apologizing?
[10:25] Mom, you don't have to apologize. Arham, trust me, I went to her room.
Sanaya, not necessarily mom would have forgotten.
[10:31] You can also forget because you get so busy.
[10:34] But how, I remembered that.
It's enough. There is no need to argue.
[10:38] Go and bring her insulin, I will inject that. Then give her tea. We are getting late for office as well.
[10:47] Mom.
[10:48] I put some cash in your closet last night. I was so worried while searching that in the morning.
[10:53] I have taken that from your closet.
[10:56] I don't know what happened to your memory. I will bring almonds for you so that your memory will be recovered.
[11:00] Mom, leave those almonds. I talked to Haris.
[11:04] Her mother will come here at 4 PM and this time you will have to accept her condition, you won't refuse at all.
[11:10] But she has been refusing for the last five years.
[11:13] She keep mentioning her wishes, sometimes she asks for a motorbike and sometimes for gold. How can we fulfill her demands.
[11:19] Why?
[11:20] The jewelry of grandma which was inherited to us but you sold that and sent money to uncle.
[11:26] But now you are reluctant to ask for reward of that good deed for the sake of your daughters.
[11:30] When selfishness overcomes the blood relations
[11:34] Then there are only bodies to be buried.
[11:36] You have broken your relation with him, but not me.
[11:38] I will talk to uncle myself.
Do whatever you want.
[11:41] When someone is blindfolded then he can't understand anything. And in that situation we feel that the person who is advising us is bad.
[11:47] Mom
[11:48] I am observing that your thoughts have been changed ever since Haris has left this neighborhood.
[11:52] You don't give any value to my in-laws.
[11:55] We only give value to those who want to make relationship instead of bargaining.
[11:59] And that Haris, whom you love so much.
[12:03] He hasn't left anything in fooling you.
[12:06] Mom, please.
[12:08] Maybe this time they are really coming to fix the marriage.
[12:11] The marriage which is at stake even before fixing, you know the final result of that. Right?
[12:16] You told me the final result of my proposal.
[12:18] But tell me one thing.
[12:20] What if Fabiaha's in-laws will put same condition then will you also make delay in getting her married timely.
[12:26] Hamza is not like that.
[12:27] And if will feel a bit that he is greedy then I will end relationship with him.
Only time will tell.
[12:51] Hey brother Raheem, greetings.
Greetings, how are you?
[12:56] I am fine.
[12:57] So you are here on your morning duty.
[12:59] I am doing my duty in your area.
Tell me if you need my help.
[13:06] Fabiha.
[13:09] I think Hamza has arrived. You should go. She is out of her mind.
[13:17] Bye.
Bye.
[13:22] Mom, please agree with me.
[13:24] Don't spoil my mind and let me finish my breakfast.
[13:27] You always cries about your marriage.
[13:31] I am coming Hamza
[13:36] You take so long to come, I have been waiting for you for so long.
[13:38] I will lose my job because of you one day.
I also get late because of you.
[13:43] Sometime your bike is out of order and sometime you don't have any petrol.
[13:46] No Fabiha, it doesn't happen everyday.
[13:48] And if a person can't wait for five minutes then how will he spend his life with me?
[13:52] Madam
[13:54] Only those make claims and promises in love whose love is fake.
[13:58] True love doesn't depend on any claim or promise.
Are you done?
[14:04] Shall we?
Yes. You are delaying now.
[14:15] You were making so many big claims.
Here you go.
[14:21] Let's go.
Yes.
[14:27] Did you call Sanaya?
Yes I called her.
[14:31] Greetings mom.
Greetings.
[14:36] Whom did you call?
[14:39] Sanaya called me, she told me that Sanaya has a very high fever.
[14:43] So she won't go to school today and she will drop her here today.
[14:47] Has Inaya gone to school?
[14:49] Yes, with a great difficulty.
[14:51] As soon as she knew that Sanaya is bringing Hareem here then she didn't want to go to school at all.
[14:56] Yes, they are very good friends.
Yes because they have been living together since childhood.
[15:02] They play together, go to functions together and they are in same school so what else they can do.
[15:08] It's very strange.
[15:10] Sanaya's mother-in-law couldn't become a good grandmother.
[15:14] It is rightly said that lucky ones can manage such blessings.
[15:17] And for a good luck one should get a mother like you.
[15:22] Really? Take this butter and put as much as you can. Even knife is fallen.
[15:27] Mom you always ask me to put butter on bread.
[15:30] Your bike is so old.
Oh, so that's the point.
[15:33] Let's see, how I ride.
[15:41] Wow Hamza, you flew me and bring me here. Look we have reached there.
OK, make fun of me.
[15:47] It doesn't happen everyday Fabiha.
"It doesn't happen everyday Fabiha".
[15:51] Get off, let me check the problem.
[15:53] I think my bike is bothering me everyday just like you.
[15:57] Whether you may lose your job or not but I will definitely lose mine.
[16:00] I want you to lose your job. Hold your bag.
[16:04] If I was not needy then I wouldn't be doing this job and you know this very well.
[16:11] You spend so much on this bike, why don't you buy a car on installments?
[16:15] How long will you keep waiting for your promotion.
[16:18] Sit.
[16:21] Put this bag here.
[16:24] Arham, do you really think that I made that mistake.
[16:27] Has anything like that happened before today?
[16:29] Maybe you would have forgotten.
[16:31] You could have end that argument by saying few words.
[16:35] I know that you have so many responsibilities and you fulfill your responsibilities in a very good manner.
[16:40] And I like this thing about you that you are passionate but after all you are a human being.
[16:44] And human make mistakes and admitting mistakes is not a big deal.
[16:49] I am sorry. I will be careful next time.
[16:51] Mom needs insulin timely.
[16:56] Where are vouchers of Hadi and Hareem?
[17:00] I put those in your wallet and also transferred the amount. Don't forget to pay today, it's last date today.
[17:06] I will come back early after attending my meeting and then
[17:10] I will take my dear daughter to doctor. OK?
[17:14] I will also try to come early.
[17:17] Mom.
Yes.
[17:19] Take a day off from office today.
[17:22] I am not feeling well.
[17:25] My darling, my princess, I will come back early. I promise. OK?
[17:31] Till then, your granny will take care of you.
[17:37] You will be alright.
[17:43] We have reached granny's house.
[17:47] We are there.
[17:50] Come on my child.
[17:56] Take care.
[18:00] Shabana
[18:03] Shabana
[18:06] Yes madam.
[18:08] Why didn't Fabiha come as yet?
[18:10] I don't know madam.
[18:12] If we give some importance to these poor people they forget their real worth.
[18:21] She has come.
[18:22] Hmm, go and see, I think princess has arrived
[18:31] Give it to me and take care of food.
Right.
[18:36] Look what is this?
[18:45] Open your mouth.
[18:46] I don't want to eat it.
My dear, if you won't eat then how will you take medicine.
[18:53] And your fever won't come down without medicine.
Yes, she is right. Eat it.
[18:59] Granny please call mom and ask her to come. I don't want to eat.
[19:03] I am here with you my darling.
[19:08] We will call mom. What are you feeling, tell me. Drink milk.
Come on good girl.
[19:18] That's like a good girl. One more sip.
[19:22] One more.
No.
[19:24] Aunt please, I don't want to drink.
[19:26] Tell me what are you feeling?
[19:29] She has a very high fever.
[19:31] My head is spinning.
Bring me cold water with cloth strips. I am taking her to my room.
[19:38] OK.
Come with me my dear.
[19:41] Be careful.
[19:51] Hurry up, madam is very angry.
[19:54] My daughter.
Hareem.
[19:58] What is happening to her.
Call Sanaya immediately.
[20:04] Nothing happened, she will be alright. Doctors are treating her.
[20:06] Yes but I dropped Hareem at your home so what are we doing here in hospital.
Brother Arham actually
[20:12] Hareem go a very high fever and then her body started to shake suddenly.
[20:17] How did that happen
[20:20] She fainted.
[20:27] Greetings madam, I am sorry. Actually.
What is your reporting time?
[20:32] 9 AM.
[20:34] Oh really. I think you don't know about time.
[20:38] Madam, actually I got late because bike was out of order.
Oh I see.
[20:43] You make new excuse everyday. Sometime your bike goes out of order and sometime your mother fall ill.
[20:48] Do you want to continue this job or not?
[20:50] Even though you know that mom needs medicine on time and her dress should be changed as well.
[20:56] Despite that you are so careless.
[20:58] Let me file a complaint against you in management office.
[21:00] No madam, this won't happen again. I will take care of time in future. If they will know about it then they will fire me.
[21:06] Please forgive me.
[21:08] Oh really? Those who care that much about their job then they come on time as well.
[21:14] Please give me last warning. I won't do that again. I am sorry.
[21:18] Shabana
[21:20] Bring coffee for me.
[21:31] Meeting is ready. Ask Hamza to meet me.
OK Sanaya.
[21:35] Good morning madam.
Good morning.
[21:37] Thank you.
[21:39] Good morning madam.
Good morning.
[22:17] Hi
Greetings mom.
Greetings.
[22:21] How is Hareem feeling now?
She is sleeping.
[22:24] Did she eat something?
[22:25] Soniya her best to feed her but she didn't eat anything.
[22:31] And she managed to give her half glass of milk with great difficulty.
[22:40] OK, I have taken appointment from doctor. I will come as soon as my meeting is over.
[22:44] OK my child.
[22:45] You don't have to worry. I am here with my dear dolly.
[22:51] I am satisfied that you and sister-in-law are with her.
[22:55] OK mom, I will talk to you later. I have to attend meeting.
OK bye.
[23:04] Good morning madam.
Good morning.
[23:07] Boss has called for a meeting.
OK I am coming.
[23:11] Listen, take my laptop and patch it with projector. I am coming.
[23:25] Anything else?
No, thank you.
[23:38] It's good that you called me. I was missing you so much.
[23:42] Tell me, how is my grand daughter?
[23:46] And how is Sameer, my dear son-in-law?
We all are fine, how about you?
[23:52] Nothing will happen to me, I am made up of stones.
[23:57] Why are you saying so? Has sister-in-law said something to you?
[24:00] Just leave it and tell me that when will you come to Pakistan?
I called you to tell about that.
[24:06] Our flight is booked for day after tomorrow.
[24:07] Our children have vacations so Sameer said that it's better to visit your mom than visit Dubai.
[24:13] That's great, welcome.
[24:18] I will tell Arham so that he inform his wife as well.
[24:23] By the way, have you look at yourself?
[24:26] You have become so week. Don't you take insulin on time?
[24:29] No one has time for me.
[24:33] She goes to office in the morning and then comes back in evening after spending few hours at her mother's house.
[24:39] She will take care of anyone else if she will get some spare time from her job.
[24:43] I shared Arham with her with great difficulty but she snatched her.
[24:46] And they want me to take care of their children.
[24:49] But I refused straight away.
[24:51] I don't have that much energy.
[24:54] I am getting old.
[24:55] I did such things in my young age but I can't do now.
[24:59] But why will you take care of children.
[25:02] It's the responsibility of mother.
[25:05] And why did you allow her to do job?
[25:08] Brother earns well. If she is so keen to earn money then she can do some online work. There are so many options.
[25:15] There is no need to go out of home.
[25:17] But she doesn't want to stay at home.
[25:20] She has turned her wishes into necessities and controls her husband.
[25:24] But why did brother become so careless?
[25:26] He used to take great care of you.
[25:28] Not everyone is obedient like your husband.
[25:34] 80 percent men are like this here.
[25:37] One of them is found in our home.
[25:39] But I have a tight grip on Arham.
[25:44] Otherwise he would go out of my hands. I don't know what magic Sanaya has done to him that he thinks her words as final words.
[25:51] But why?
[25:53] You are head of this family so you should make decisions in this house.
[25:56] Don't worry, I will talk to brother when I come.
[26:04] Aunt it's time for your medicine.
[26:07] Let's take medicine. 
[26:10] I don't want to take medicine.
[26:13] Why aren't you taking it? Please take it.
Get lost.
[26:16] Take it away. I don't want to eat it.
[26:19] You are so nice and you listen to everyone.
[26:22] Let's do one thing, first you take medicine then we will go out.
You lie.
[26:27] It's my firm promise that I will take out. Right?
But you will have to take medicine first. Come on.
[26:40] Very good.
Let's go now.
[26:44] Let me put this glass back then we will go.
No, we will go now.
[26:48] OK
[26:50] Let's go.
[26:55] Did his fever go down?
[26:58] Her fever is not coming down.
[27:01] What kind of fever it is?
I think she has effected from someone's bad sight.
[27:06] Let me recite something.
[27:19] Hareem.
[27:22] Oh, Hareem.
[27:24] Hareem.
[27:25] What happened my daughter?
Hareem.
[27:30] Oh
[27:32] Call Sanaya immediately.
[27:37] Oh God.
Hareem.
[27:39] My dear.
[27:40] Hareem my dear.
[27:42] Oh my God.
[27:44] Oh God.
[27:52] Sanaya is not receiving my call.
[27:54] Oh God.
[27:57] Let me call brother Arham.
Call him.
[27:59] Take deep breath.
[28:02] Take deep breath.
[28:08] What's up sister?
Brother Arham.
[28:10] Hi
[28:12] Hi
[28:21] What's up sister?
Brother Arham, Hareem's condition is not good.
[29:11] Mom, Junaid has arrived, I am taking her to hospital
[30:27] Well done, your presentation was so good.
Thank you sir.
I liked your plan so much.
[30:32] The idea of theme park is like a cherry on the cake.
[30:35] You will see that we will get so many clients after seeing that.
Thank you sir.
[30:45] Oh my God, 35 missed calls from Arham.
[30:49] Mom called me as well.
Is everything OK?
[30:53] Sir, my daughter was not feeling well, I think there is some emergency.
Don't panic, hopefully everything will be fine.
[31:01] Hi Arham
[31:03] What?
[31:06] In which hospital?
[31:08] OK, I am coming.
[31:11] Sir, my daughter is not feeling well and she is in hospital. I will have to go.
Go immediately. Don't worry about work, we will take care of that, OK?
[31:17] Thank you so much sir.
Welcome.
[31:33] Oh God.
[31:35] Nothing has happened. She will be alright.
[31:38] How will I face Sanaya?
[31:41] She drops her on my responsibility.
It's not your fault. Why are you worried. Don't think that way.
[31:48] But what about Arham? He is my son-in-law.
[31:50] What will you tell him Junaid?
[31:59] My child.
What happened to Hareem?
[32:03] Nothing has happened? She will be alright. Doctors are treating her.
[32:05] Yes but I dropped Hareem at your home so what are we doing here in hospital?
Brother Arham actually
[32:11] Hareem had a very high favor and then her body started to shake suddenly and then..
Then what sister?
[32:19] She fainted.
[32:32] Where is Hareem? What happened to Hareem? Where is she?
[32:37] Is my daughter fine? Tell me.
[32:41] Sanaya
[32:42] Come here.
What happened to her? Where is she?
[32:44] I want to talk to doctor. Brother, where is Hareem?
[32:46] Don't worry, we are here with you. Please relax.
[32:51] Sit here.
Sister tell me what happened to her?
[32:54] Nothing has happened to Hareem. She is absolutely fine. Sit here.
[32:57] How can I sit, why aren't you telling me that what happened to her?
She has got a very high fever.
[33:03] Where is she? I want to talk to doctor. Where is she?
[33:06] Where is she?
Sanaya just sit here and pray for her. Everything will be alright.
[33:11] She will be alright. Sit here.
[33:15] Arham
[33:20] Where are her parents?
Yes.
[33:22] Children get fits due to high fever normally.
[33:27] And she got high fever because she didn't get medicine on time.
[33:31] So she got these fits because of that.
[33:36] But there is nothing to worry about. She is totally fine.
[33:39] But we will keep her under observation and make sure that she may not get fits again.
[33:44] But you will have to be very careful for her in future.
Thank you doctor.
[33:48] Can I see my daughter?
[33:51] We are shifting her to room then you will see her.
[33:54] Thank God.
[34:02] We had to come yesterday to fix marriage date.
[34:06] But Haris has told me today that he has lost his job.
[34:11] It's obvious that you are bride's family so it is necessary to tell you.
[34:15] Otherwise you would think something else.
He has lost his job.
[34:19] But he joined this job last month.
[34:23] Aunt, you call that a job. There was no opportunity and no future growth.
[34:31] God bless you.
Haris won't do such kind of job.
[34:35] And there is some caliber aunt.
So what do you think then?
[34:41] What else can we think? You won't marry your daughter with a guy who has no job.
[34:47] And to be honest, there is nothing left in Pakistan now.
[34:51] We have planned that Haris will go abroad.
[34:55] But it's very difficult to go abroad in current scenario.
[34:58] Yes you are absolutely right.
[35:02] We have no relative outside Pakistan
[35:05] But
[35:07] But your real brother is settled in Muscat.
[35:10] You should ask him to call Haris there.
[35:14] But he is my brother on paper.
[35:18] We just know about his well being on festivals. We don't have any connection with him.
[35:25] I am sorry, I can't call him.
[35:32] By the way, don't mind sister that people do so much to marry their daughter. They give house, car and so many things in dowry.
[35:46] But you only have to make a call by putting your ego aside.
[35:50] So do that. And Haris won't live alone abroad.
Yes.
[35:56] Your rather our daughter will live in luxuries there so think about it.
[36:24] Didn't you dad come?
Your dad didn't come as well.
[36:28] How will I go home? I am starving.
[36:46] Eat this.
[36:48] My mom has forbidden me to eat someone else' food.
[36:52] Look my mom has arrived. I am going.
[37:26] Wait a minute
[37:29] Hadi my child
[37:30] No one has come to take you as yet?
[37:32] No.
Not yet
[37:34] Whole school is empty but no one has come to take him.
[37:39] Mom.
[37:41] This time aunt hasn't put any such condition that we can't fulfill that.
[37:44] At least you should call uncle once.
[37:47] I know my brother very well.
[37:49] He will never agree for this..
[37:51] But how can you say that without even talking to him?
[37:55] And just imagine that if uncle agrees and he calls Haris abroad
[38:00] Then burden from your shoulders will lessen and I will go to my house.
[38:05] I am afraid because of this Farheen.
[38:08] I think if we won't fulfil the demands of your in-laws then they will create a drama here.
[38:18] When your daughter will get effected by rejection of proposal then the drama will be created.
[38:25] Then what will you tell people that why did five years long relation ended.
[38:30] What will I tell?
[38:31] I will tell about demands of your in-laws.
Really?
[38:36] Then people will say
[38:37] That you couldn't fulfill a single demand of your daughter's in-laws for the sake of your daughter.
[38:42] Don't talk that much
[38:44] I told you that I won't call your uncle because he won't agree for this.
[38:49] But why mom. At least call him once.
[38:53] I told you that I won't call him. Take a side.
[38:57] OK, don't call him.
[38:59] You neither like me nor my happiness.
[39:04] Make tea.
[39:12] Hi.
Hi.
[39:13] Greetings sir, I am Hadi's class teacher. Hadi is sitting all alone in school. Why haven't you come to take him as yet?
[39:24] Is Hadi still in school?
