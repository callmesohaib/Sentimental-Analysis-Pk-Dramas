[00:54] Arham, do you know? Today, I've spent such a good time with the kids after so long
[01:02] I saw that
[01:04] you had become a kid with the kids
[01:08] honestly speaking, today I felt as if I have lived my entire life in a single day
[01:13] I did so much of work, but I don't feel tired
[01:19] today for the first time I felt as if I have fulfilled the responsibility of a mother
[01:24] No, its not like that. You do that daily
[01:28] No Arham
[01:30] Every day, while going to the office in tension, it feels as if...
[01:35] I am just fulfilling my duty not responsibility
[01:39] but today, the way I had spent time with the kids without any worries
[01:43] I felt so good, I had enjoyed a lot
[01:46] it didn't feel as if I had any burden of some responsibilities on my shoulders
[01:50] in that case, you should be thankful to Fabiha that she took a day off
[01:54] and you got a chance to spend time with the kids. You had fun
[01:58] but I want to spend time with the kids in the same manner on a daily basis
[02:04] and Arham, its only possible if I quit from my job
[02:08] you also got a promotion now
[02:11] your salary will also increase accordingly
[02:14] So, I think now I should leave my job
[02:18] I didn't get it
[02:20] what's not to understand in this, Arham?
[02:24] I was doing the job, in order to help you
[02:28] kids fee, house related expenses. We can manage it all together
[02:33] but now, you can afford all this alone
[02:36] so what's the need for me to do so much of hard work?
[02:38] I will stay at home, spend time with the kids, take care of your mother
[02:42] and at night, I will wait for you after getting ready before your arrival
[02:55] Sanaya look
[02:57] if you will quit the job then it won't affect me personally but..
[03:04] try to understand
[03:07] When you get a promotion, then obviously your lifestyle changes. The expenses increase
[03:13] what do you think? Will the kids fee stay the same? Static? No!
[03:18] it will increase with time, electricity bills & grocery... everything will gradually increase
[03:23] the inflation will increase, it will never reduce
[03:28] I agree when you get promoted, then you feel really good in the few initial months
[03:33] Things look much better, but right now, our Hadi has to become an engineer
[03:39] we have a daughter, & she has to become a doctor
[03:43] I won't be able to do it alone
[03:46] I need your support
[03:49] So, if ever required, I will do the job again. But for now, I think I should quit my job
[03:57] at least, you should have discussed it with me before taking the decision
[04:02] Its not a decision, Arham
[04:05] I've expressed my desire
[04:12] Okay, if you have decided then what can I say? I will support you
[04:19] your choice
[04:22] let me finish my work
[05:24] is all this written in my fate as well?
[05:27] Can Hamza keep me happy?
[05:29] but what does he have to keep me happy?
Sister was right
[05:34] I have to live with Hamza in a two bedroom house
[05:37] as if he will take me to the Taj Mahal
[05:40] even if I got married, then how the situation of this house will change?
[05:44] Hamza, whose job cannot be trusted. He is unable to afford his own expenses
[05:48] how will he support my house?
[06:05] in order to change my situation, I have to refuse from this marriage
[06:09] I cannot loose hope so soon
[06:11] I have to take a step myself in order to uplift my fate
[06:15] my life is not to be caged within the four walls
[06:18] I want to see this house & all the members of this family to shine bright like a moon
[06:23] and for that I need to fight with this world & from my fate
[06:27] I cannot let anyone come in between my intentions
[06:31] then no matter if its Hamza
[06:59] hello!
[07:00] yes Fabiha, this is Arham speaking
[07:03] I was a bit worried for you, so I thought of calling you
[07:07] how is your sister?
[07:09] we have handled her with a lot of difficultly
[07:11] I can understand
[07:14] he left her in bad times
[07:18] even you must be thinking that in what kind of a life I am stuck
[07:22] Fabiha, life is the name of trials
[07:25] if you think that you worries are too big, then try to ask someone else about their worries
[07:32] after that, you will find your worries very small
[07:35] you are right
[07:37] its like that
[07:39] I am not liking anything while seeing my sister in this condition, not even my happiness
[07:45] good & bad times are already written in our fate
[07:49] we cannot fight with them before time
[07:52] therefore, we are helpless in front of our fate
[07:55] we cannot do anything
[07:57] one needs to make its own fate, Arham sir
[08:00] otherwise, a person is unable to handle those happiness which are already written in his/her fate
[08:05] and we only live once
[08:10] now it depends on us that in what manner we want to spend it
[08:16] well, your thinking is good. Its quite late night
[08:19] I am hanging up, take care
[08:22] Bye!
[08:24] Bye!
[08:43] sister, you haven't slept as of yet?
[08:50] I had tried a lot
[08:55] but... when I close my eyes
[08:59] then only... 
[09:02] I can see the same scene
[09:10] sister, please stop it
[09:12] when it didn't affected him, then why do you want to keep yourself in this torment?
[09:21] I... 
[09:23] I took a stand for such a person
[09:28] who never loved me
[09:33] nor he ever did anything for me
[09:40] but Fabiha
[09:44] you can do a lot
[09:49] you have time
[09:52] you are young & beautiful
[10:00] you can choose a person for yourself who.. 
[10:04] who will keep you happy
[10:07] otherwise, what about men!
[10:11] he gets free from all the responsibilities by just uttering three words of divorce
[10:19] the way Haris did with me
[10:26] I don't want that.. 
[10:29] you shall experience the same that I had experience
[10:34] therefore, take every decision of your life with a lot of thinking
[10:40] because the decision you will make
[10:43] it will make the path of your upcoming life
[10:53] leave Hamza
[10:57] sister, what are you saying?
[11:00] I am saying the right thing
[11:03] I know you don't love Hamza
[11:06] and one's stomach cannot be filled with love
[11:10] we live only once
[11:12] and if there is no happiness in life, then every moment of life reminds us of death
[11:19] therefore, set yourself free from this forceful relation
[11:43] I think, we need to postpone the wedding
[11:46] its not appropriate to do such a haste in wedding after what happened with Farheen
[11:52] how much more we need to postpone the wedding, Hamza?
[11:56] every time, the wedding gets postponed due to some excuse or so
[12:00] sometimes, its Fabihas issue or sister Shaheen gets sick
[12:03] and now, Farheen's issue has arise
[12:06] what can we do, mom?
[12:07] if we will do the marriage forcefully then it will be called selfishness & I am not selfish
[12:12] we have to take care of their emotions
[12:16] so brother, the wedding is not tomorrow. Almost a month is left for the wedding
[12:20] during this time, sister Farheen's grief will lessen a bit and their emotions will change too
[12:25] a month is not enough to forget anyone's unfaithful nature, Hania
[12:30] when sister Shaheen doesn't have any problem, then what problem do you have?
[12:35] She will manage
[12:37] yes! If Fabiha have said anything then its a different matter
[12:42] nobody had said anything to me
[12:45] its my own decision
[12:51] how come anybody haven't said anything?
[12:52] its clearly evident that sister Fabiha had got another reason to refuse from this marriage
[12:58] I am amazed that why brother is unable to understand this
[13:02] don't know what blindfold he is wearing
[13:09] oh my Lord, you are very great & merciful
[13:13] remove all the worries of my family with this rising sun
[13:18] you have command on everything
[13:20] bless my daughter with good fate
[13:23] remove the worries of my family, my Lord
[13:35] mom
[13:38] are you upset with me?
[13:40] No dear
[13:41] I am not upset with you
[13:46] don't you feel angry?
[13:49] I have endured such a big loss, by not listening to you
[13:53] I used to make you understand, in order to save you from this torment
[13:57] but maybe, this was written in your fate
[14:03] what shall I do now?
[14:06] I can't find peace
[14:09] no dear
[14:11] you have to be patient
[14:15] there is an ease after every difficulty
[14:20] mom
[14:22] try talking to uncle
[14:25] maybe he knows something, he might have met Haris
[14:30] no dear
[14:32] its useless to talk to your uncle
[14:35] our spectacle will be made in the entire world
[14:37] you know how your aunty is
[14:40] She will auction our honor in the entire world
[14:43] its better for us to stay quiet right now
[14:47] our honor is already auctioned
[14:50] maybe, my heart finds a little peace by talking to uncle
[14:57] if you think that your heart will find peace in this way
[15:02] then talk to him
[15:44] you came early today?
[15:46] yes, Since I got late yesterday so I thought to come early today
[15:50] I've made the kids & aunty's breakfast. Also I have checked her sugar too
[15:55] also Arham sir's coffee is almost done
[15:59] do let me know if you have any other work
[16:02] I am really sorry. Arham told me about your sister, I felt so bad
[16:06] how is she now?
[16:11] when our life is dependent on only one person & he refuses to continue the relation then
[16:16] it takes time to get back on the track, maam Sanaya
[16:20] absolutely correct! It takes time
[16:22] now see, my mother-in-law wanted me to leave the job since very long time
[16:25] she wanted me to stay at home & take care of the kids
[16:27] but finally, now its possible
[16:32] Arham got a promotion, now I can leave the job without any hesitation
[16:36] everything gets fine with time
[16:40] are you quitting your job?
[16:43] yes, I will stay at home & take care of the kids. This way mom will also be happy
[16:48] what will happen to my job if she quits her job?
[16:52] and what is sir Arham's perception about it?
[16:57] Arham wants me to continue the job
[17:02] but he should be happy with your decision
[17:05] as you are keeping his family on priority & thinking about his mother
[17:12] by the way, my mother says "if a man gets the taste of a woman's earning then it never fades away"
[17:21] serve the coffee to Arham, I am getting late for office. Ok?
[17:48] I've talked to Mr. Junaid about you
[17:51] soon he will do an arrangement
[17:53] don't you worry
[17:55] after giving so many years to the company, they don't trust our honesty?
[18:00] what's the use of working in a company where they don't value our time or emotions
[18:06] Hamza, did you talk to Sanaya maam?
[18:09] what's the use of talking to her?
[18:12] after all, she is an employee of this company. She is a part of this company
[18:15] and nobody puts their job in danger for others
[18:20] Okay Hamza don't take tension, there might be God's betterment in it
[18:29] these are a few things, let me return them
[18:40] maam, these are a few things which I got from the company
[18:44] check it once, what if there is something missing in it
[18:47] otherwise, maybe I will be blamed for it as well
[18:56] I know Hamza you didn't steal anything, I know you
[19:04] but the allegations on you were proved correct in the audit
[19:11] I am really sorry
[19:15] I couldn't change the decision of board of directors
[19:24] I tried a lot so that you didn't have to pay back the amount, but it couldn't happen
[19:32] therefore... 
[19:35] you have to submit 2 lacs within 2 months, otherwise
[19:40] the company can file a case on you
[19:51] I know
[19:58] Sorry Hamza
[20:06] best of luck for your future
[21:01] you are so pretty
well-educated
[21:05] you can get best of the best guys
[21:10] now look at Sanaya, she is an ordinary looking girl but she is living a luxurious life after marrying Arham
[21:17] so why can't you live in luxuries?
[21:23] how do you find Arham?
[22:46] Coffee
[22:49] thanks!
[22:59] The coffee prepared by Sanaya tastes amazing
[23:02] actually, I have made this coffee
[23:06] really?
[23:09] but it tastes exactly like Sanaya's coffee
[23:12] I learnt it from her
[23:14] but maybe now she has to make it everyday
[23:19] what do you mean, are you going somewhere?
[23:23] maybe
[23:25] Maam Sanaya was telling me that she is leaving her job
[23:32] but I don't want this
[23:34] I tried to explain her, but don't know why she is unable to understand
[23:45] I think, she should care about your wish
[23:52] even you are thinking about her betterment
[23:56] Obviously, you won't be that selfish to think about yourself only
[24:03] earlier, she used to do the job to make both the ends meet
[24:06] now if life is giving her a chance, so she should make her career too
[24:09] she should be happy about it
[24:17] but, this is your personal matter. What can I say?
[24:22] but I have a request
[24:26] I will be needing sometime to return the loan
[24:31] I cannot return it immediately
[24:36] don't worry, you are not going anywhere
[24:38] also your job is as it is
[24:48] the coffee is good
[25:03] here is your tea, and your soup
[25:07] thank you!
[25:08] have you forgotten mom's medicines prescription?
[25:11] oh! I forgot that. Let me bring it right away
[25:15] I remember one thing
[25:17] even I forgot to tell you guys something
[25:20] What?
[25:20] Sanaya had called to inform that Arham got a promotion & now he got a manager's position
[25:29] Great! but I didn't get any call from Sanaya
[25:33] why will she call us?
[25:35] She must be thinking, what if we cast an evil eye on her success
[25:41] it cannot happen! Sanaya had told me that she had called you both
[25:46] but you didn't receive
[25:49] no mom, I didn't got any call from Sanaya or from anyone
[25:52] neither I got any call, mom
[25:54] maybe, she had said it in order to make you happy
[25:57] anyways, I am going to the kitchen. Do let me know if you need anything
[26:03] Junaid, listen to me
[26:05] Do call Arham & congratulate him
[26:08] don't know how he feels, what if he minds
[26:11] I will call him, don't worry
[26:13] yes
[26:48] hello! greetings uncle! this is Farheen speaking
[26:54] hello!
[26:55] hello?
[27:05] shall I try calling Haris once?
[27:17] my God will take the revenge of the oppression you did with me, Haris
[27:53] Hania
[27:55] quickly bring me a cup of tea, I am having severe headache
[27:58] Greetings mom, how are you?
[27:59] greetings!
[28:01] How come you came so early today from your office?
[28:05] what shall I tell you, mom
[28:08] you seem worried, is everything fine?
[28:12] what happened?
the matter is worrisome
[28:14] tell me something! you are beating about the bush
[28:18] they have fired me from my job
[28:20] What!
[28:22] You got fired from the job?
[28:24] but why?
[28:27] how can they fire you from the job so easily? And you've been working since so long
[28:31] they have put the allegation of stealing on me
[28:34] they think that I stole the money from the company,
[28:36] Furthermore, the most worrisome thing is that I have to return that amount to them within 2 months
[28:41] and how much is the amount?
[28:46] 10 lac rupees
[28:49] and if I won't be able to return them, then they will file a case of embezzlement against me
[28:57] Hamza
[28:59] you've lost your job, also the amount is quite a lot. How we will return it?
[29:04] something will be arranged, don't worry
[29:06] how can I not worry? You have lost your job
[29:10] its such a hefty amount, how will you return it?
[29:15] what will we do?
[29:17] but nothing will happen by worrying
[29:20] a person needs to do something or the other
[29:24] and I will do
[29:26] I will fix everything
[29:29] don't you worry
[29:35] Does Sister Fabiha know about this matter?
[29:52] ok tell me something
[29:55] Where will you two go for your honeymoon after marriage?
[30:00] do you have any plan to go to Murree or Nathiagali or will you go out of country?
[30:06] Sanaya had gone to Paris with Arham
[30:09] where will you go?
[30:12] desires are like dreams, aunty
which are never fulfilled
[30:17] they are standing in front of us like a mirror, as soon as you open your eyes
[30:21] It's more than enough for me to visit my parents' house the day after my marriage
[30:25] come here
[30:27] why your desires won't be fulfilled?
[30:31] now look at Sanaya
[30:34] Arham fulfills all her undue wishes as well
[30:37] So, you will also get your needs fulfilled by your husband, why not?
[30:42] We can shift the responsibility to the person who is capable of handling it
[30:46] what does Hamza do?
[30:48] Does he have a job or does he run his own business?
[30:52] He works in maam Sanaya's office in accounts department
[30:57] Oh I see...
[31:01] so he is an accountant
[31:03] hmm... his salary must be almost 40 to 50 thousand only
[31:07] but nowadays, its difficult to survive in this salary
[31:11] right?
[31:15] It may be nearing completion, or it might have already finished by now
[31:18] oho! its such an oppression with you Fabiha
[31:23] How can a person who doesn't earn well keep you happy? 
Why is your mother marrying you to him?
[31:34] its my mother's decision, aunty
[31:37] Okay
[31:39] its not necessary that all the decisions of our elders are correct
[31:43] I don't think its right, yet she is your real mother
[31:47] what quality do you lack?
[31:50] you are so pretty
well-educated
[31:53] you can get best of the best guys
[31:59] now look at Sanaya, she is an ordinary looking girl but she is living a luxurious life after marrying Arham
[32:05] so why can't you live in luxuries?
[32:11] how do you find Arham?
[32:15] what!
[32:17] tell me, how do you find Arham?
[32:23] he is good
[32:25] just good?
[32:29] my son is so graceful & handsome
[32:34] and look at Sanaya
[32:36] there is no match
[32:38] honestly speaking, I would have made you my daughter-in-law. As I like you so much
[32:55] do you know
[32:58] many times we need to leave the compulsions of relations behind in order to move ahead in your lives
[33:11] every time, emotional decisions aren't correct
[33:15] I must say, find someone for yourself
[33:19] look around yourself
[33:21] you might find someone better than Hamza, who gives you all the happiness that you deserve
[33:37] Anyways, send Arham to me
[33:40] tell him, your mother is calling you
[33:42] Okay
[34:00] how do you find Arham?
[34:36] Arham sir
[34:42] Arham sir
[35:04] Fabiha
[35:07] Sir, Aunty sent me to call you. I was looking for you, but the door locked behind me
[35:13] now its not opening, please have a look
[35:16] Relax! this door gets locked like this. Let me open it right away
[35:22] this door gets locked just like this
[35:25] check for the keys in that drawer
[36:08] Fabiha
[36:10] Fabiha
[36:12] Fabiha
[36:21] Fabiha
[36:43] Arham sir, there are no keys here
[36:46] Fabiha
[36:48] Relax, Sanaya has come. She will open the door
[36:51] If anyone sees us together like this, they might get the wrong idea
[36:57] and then she is your wife
[36:58] Fabiha, Sanaya & I love each other. We trust each other
[37:01] So relax, don't worry!
[37:03] She trusts you, not me
[37:06] and misunderstandings do happen in this relation of love
[37:09] and I don't want your family to be destroyed along with my character
[37:14] please, try to understand
[37:16] Arham
[37:19] yes Sanaya, the door got locked. Kindly try to open it from outside
[37:25] Ok wait, I have the keys let me open the door
[37:30] where is Fabiha?
[37:32] I am asking you Arham, where is Fabiha?
[37:36] she must be inside mom's room, where else she could be?
[37:39] No, she is not inside mom's room. Nor inside the kitchen
[37:47] Anyways, Mr. Akram has canceled my resignation
[37:52] he was saying that I am in a 2 years contract
[37:54] I can't leave the job until I finish heading the project
[37:59] its a good thing, even I want you to continue your job & make your career
[38:11] shall I ask you something?
[38:16] yes, go ahead
[38:21] haven't you become habitual of my job?
[38:25] Sanaya, what childish thing are you saying? Who said this to you?
[38:32] Just like that... I had a feeling in my heart, so I asked you
[38:37] anyways...
[38:38] let me freshen up, then we'll drink tea
