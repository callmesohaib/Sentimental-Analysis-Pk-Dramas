[00:13] Say what is in your heart.
[00:17] Maybe that will help in reducing distances.
[00:28] What will you say?
[00:33] Me?
[00:35] Yes it's you Fabeeha.
[00:39] Haniya control yourself.
[00:46] Brother
[00:47] Mom
[01:32] Haniya
[01:34] Stop crying.
[01:36] Why this happened brother?
Stop it my dear.
[01:41] You are mom's brave child.
[01:44] Don't cry like this. Stop.
[01:47] Control yourself.
[01:54] Funeral will be held after Zuhr prayer.
[02:58] Hamza
[03:02] You are badly injured.
[03:05] Do I apply ointment?
[03:08] That ointment won't help Farheen. Leave me alone.
[03:12] Just leave.
[03:15] Let me apply ointment then I will leave.
[03:17] As I told you
[03:20] I don't need anything.
[03:23] I don't need anyone's condolence.
[03:26] When life didn't show any mercy on me then you don't need to do that as well. Leave.
[03:32] Hamza I can understand.
[03:34] But being a human it's my duty to apply ointment on your wounds.
[03:38] Don't argue.
As I told you, just go.
[03:42] Just leave.
[03:46] Just leave.
[03:48] Just leave, please.
[04:45] Sympathy doesn't require any relation.
[04:49] It's alright that you have changed but you have just killed the humanity.
[04:55] Now what have I done?
What had to happen has happened. Now these arguments are useless.
[05:02] Police has badly beaten Hamza.
[05:04] He has bruises all over his body, I went there to apply ointment but he didn't listen to me.
[05:09] You should try, maybe he allow you to do so.
[05:13] I know him, he won't listen to anyone.
[05:19] Fabeeha, fresh air is necessary to breathe.
[05:22] He has lost his mother along with you.
[05:25] Now your companionship can bring him back to life.
[05:28] Only you can control him at the moment.
[05:33] Rest is up to you.
[06:09] I admit that I am weak but I am not selfish.
[06:12] I can't ruin other woman's house.
[07:11] Where is first aid box?
[07:48] Do my pain and sorrows make any difference to you?
[07:57] What do you think?
[08:02] It does, that's why you are sitting with me.
[08:10] Have you eaten meal?
[08:14] My mom used to feed me, now she is gone so I am dependent on others.
[08:22] Hamza I am very sorry about aunt's demise.
[08:27] But the truth is that no one can stay with us for ever.
[08:36] But you will stay with me for ever Fabeeha. Right?
[08:44] Will you?
[08:48] Won't you leave me?
[08:53] Don't think that much, we will see when the right time will come.
[09:07] Fabeeha
[09:11] Why do I feel that you are not leaving my room but you are leaving my life.
[09:19] Hamza we will talk about it later.
[09:22] Fabeeha
[09:26] You have done favor by arranging my bail.
[09:35] But it's impossible to leave my life.
[10:37] What are you thinking by sitting here alone?
[10:41] You haven't slept yet?
[10:44] As you know that I can't sleep without you.
[10:50] And if you will have to live and sleep without me then?
That day will never come.
[11:04] You said it today
[11:07] Next time don't even think about it that I can live without you.
[11:15] Arham
[11:17] I also trust even on your breath.
[11:21] That they won't betray me.
[11:26] I can't say anything about my breath but why do you trust me that much?
[11:32] Yes
[11:35] And this trust makes a relation very strong.
[11:42] And I am sure
[11:45] That you won't give my right to anyone else.
[11:51] I love you.
[11:57] I love you.
[12:08] I love you too.
[12:40] Haniya drink water.
[12:45] Pray for aunt's eternal peace.
[12:53] If brother had come a bit earlier then my mom would have been alive.
[12:58] She left us because she was missing his son.
[13:08] Control yourself. Drink water.
[13:17] Haniya you haven't eaten since yesterday. Eat something.
[13:21] I don't need your fake sympathy.
[13:23] My brother can be blind folded in your love but not me.
[13:26] Go away.
What happened my child?
[13:29] Haniya this is not the right time for such discussion. Eat something
[13:32] Before I forget everything and misbehave with you, just go away.
[13:37] What happened? What are you talking about?
[13:39] If possible, then ask for forgiveness of your sins in front of God.
[13:44] What have I done that you are saying this.
[13:47] You have killed my mother.
[13:52] She didn't die, she was killed.
[13:55] My mother's funeral is over.
[13:57] Now you have fulfilled formality. Now just get lost.
[14:00] Just leave before I forget everything.
Haniya
[14:03] Just leave.
[14:05] What are you doing? Everyone is watching us.
Just go away.
[14:09] Get lost from here. You are presence is not required here.
Haniya
[14:12] Leave me.
What happened.
[14:15] What happened Haniya? What are you doing?
Why can't you see her wrong doings?
[14:18] She has ruined our house.
[14:21] No Haniya, control yourself. It's not her fault. What has she done?
[14:24] Tell her that she don't come here ever again.
Haniya, keep quiet.
[14:29] No Fabeeha. Stop, you can't go like this.
[14:33] Let me go Hamza. I am leaving.
No Fabeeha
[14:35] You can't go like this.
I can't bear any more humiliation. Leave me.
[14:39] Fabeeha please listen to me.
Fabeeha
[15:04] I am very sorry.
[15:08] How did that happen so suddenly?
[15:11] As long as I know, she was perfectly alright.
[15:15] That was her bad luck.
[15:17] The accusation of theft on her son took her life.
[15:24] I am so sorry Hamza that I couldn't do anything for you.
[15:28] It's not your fault mam.
[15:31] It was my bad luck.
[15:33] You came here for condolence, it's enough to prove my innocence.
[15:43] But you have to show courage at the moment.
[15:46] You have to take care of responsibilities of this house and your sister and Fabeeha is also your responsibility.
[15:56] Mam, I have a request.
[16:01] Yes go ahead.
[16:04] If you can talk on my behalf to give me some respite so much so that I can sell my house to repay my debt.
[16:17] Don't worry, I will talk to them.
[16:24] Shall we go Sanaya?
Yes.
[16:28] I am waiting for you in car.
[16:29] OK
[16:34] Take care of yourself.
[16:49] Farheen, give him something to eat. He hasn't eaten anything since last night.
[16:57] OK mom.
[17:18] Now what would you say? Did you see your daughter's worth in her in-laws' house and you force me to take care of Hamza.
[17:24] She has pushed me out of her house. What will she do after marriage?
[17:28] You have been humiliated because of your mistakes.
[17:31] My mistake? What have I done wrong?
[17:34] I am facing consequences of that debt till now and I don't know how long will I face that.
[17:39] You should admit your mistake.
[17:41] But why?
[17:42] If sir Arham hadn't given me that amount then your daughter couldn't save her dignity and honor.
[17:47] If we shouldn't forget our bad times in the same way we shouldn't forget someone's favor.
[17:52] At least you should think about me.
[17:55] Please acknowledge my sacrifices, I beg in front of you
[17:58] If you won't support me then how can I become strong. I will be humiliated if you won't do that.
[18:06] And what Haniya has done to me today
[18:10] That is unbearable.
[18:12] So, don't have any hopes from me.
[18:31] How dare you? Get out of my house.
[18:36] Get out of my house, right now, right away.
[18:40] Sanaya
[18:44] Sanaya
[18:45] Didn't you listen? Get out of my house.
[18:48] Get out.
[18:56] Mom, let me inject insulin first then I will bring dinner for you.
[19:01] Why?
[19:02] Won't you serve dinner on dining table? Arham will also eat.
[19:06] Or
[19:09] You don't like me to spend some time with Arham
[19:14] Arham doesn't want to eat and children are at mom's house so I am not serving dinner at dining table.
[19:19] Hmm, Arham doesn't eat without children.
[19:24] You would know if you were a good wife.
[19:28] But you just want everyone to be a puppet.
[19:38] You can think whatever you want. I can't do anything.
[19:44] Whatever I am doing, I am doing that as my duty.
[19:48] It's very difficult for me to live my life according to your thoughts.
[19:54] And tell me about my thoughts.
[19:58] Do you know, what do I think?
[20:01] From the very first day, I was against your job.
[20:07] But you didn't listen to me and you did what you wanted to do.
[20:12] OK do that.
[20:14] I don't care.
[20:16] But that will make difference to you.
[20:20] Whether you will quit job or continue, you will regret.
[20:28] You will regret and then you will admit one day that my mother-in-law was absolutely right.
[20:41] Let me bring dinner for you.
[21:07] You will regret.
[21:22] Did you see, how Haniya was misbehaving with me?
[21:26] That's why no one attended aunt's funeral today.
[21:29] I think no one likes them because of that.
[21:32] Stop it Fabeeha
[21:34] At least spare the deceased one.
But why?
[21:37] Didn't you see, how was she taunting me as if I have killed her mother.
And that is the truth.
[21:42] You can lie to anyone but you can't lie to me.
[21:46] Haniya was right that if Hamza was released on time then aunt would have been alive today but no
[21:52] You went with Arham instead of making arrangement for Hamza's release.
[21:56] Hamza doesn't know that you didn't make arrangement for his bail.
I don't care if Hamza knows about that.
[22:02] But Hamza will take some time to understand this. At the moment he is expecting good from you but you are doing wrong to him.
[22:10] Why are you sympathetic towards him. You were the one who was advising me.
[22:15] Because it's time to condole not to show selfishness.
[22:19] I really feel pity for Hamza and I am surprised that why aren't you feeling that being a human.
[22:27] If you share his sorrow by forgetting your happiness for a while then your happiness won't go away.
[24:39] Eat meal.
[24:43] I am not feeling hungry. You eat.
[24:46] Waiting for someone kills a person.
[24:50] And I don't have anyone except you now.
[24:55] I know that whom are you waiting for. Don't do that.
[25:00] You shouldn't have talked to Fabeeha like that Haniya.
[25:05] She deserves that.
Haniya.
[25:08] You don't know how many times I called her but she didn't receive a single call.
[25:13] If she had received my call then my mother would have been alive today.
[25:18] I am sitting in front of you because of her.
[25:22] No, you are not here because of her. You are here because of sister Farheen.
[25:28] If she hadn't called her boss then you wouldn't be here.
[25:36] But if you think that I am wrong then I will apologize.
[25:43] Eat meal.
[25:49] You eat it, I am not feeling hungry.
[25:52] You know that me and mom didn't eat until you eat with us so how can I eat now.
[25:58] Come on
[26:00] As I said, eat.
[26:03] Brother, eat it.
[26:11] OK, don't be angry and eat meal.
[26:14] Please
[26:41] Why did you wear this shirt? I was pressing this one for you.
I was getting late for office that's why I wore this one.
[26:47] But you don't like this color.
[26:51] Our liking changes with the passage of time.
[26:53] It's not necessary that I stick to same thing all the time.
[26:59] What's the matter Arham? I have been noticing you since last few days that your behavior has been changed.
[27:05] You neither eat well, nor you talk to me and sometime you don't even sleep.
[27:11] Sanaya don't focus on me.
[27:14] Otherwise you will be entangled in such misconceptions.
[27:25] What happened to him.
[27:58] Here is your coffee.
[28:03] Have you injected mom's insulin.
[28:07] Yes I injected that. She told me that she is not feeling well so she wants to take some rest.
[28:14] Did you check her fever?
Yes I did. She doesn't have any fever.
[28:18] OK Arham, I am leaving, I am getting late. Don't forget to pick children from school. Bye.
[28:37] Oh God, Jabbar, open the door quickly.
[29:39] You didn't respond to my message last night.
Which message?
[29:47] That will you support me or not?
[29:51] Why should I support you?
[29:54] What can you do for me?
[29:58] Whatever you will ask me to do.
[30:02] As you will ask me to do.
[30:04] Whatever I want.
[30:10] Tell me, what do you want?
[30:19] Oh no Sanaya, what did you do.
[30:32] I want to marry you.
Have you thought that what will people say?
[30:38] I don't care about that. If you want then I can marry you.
[30:44] If you want to hide that then we will do that but I need your consent.
[30:53] I can't live without you.
[31:24] How dare you?
[31:27] Get out of my house.
[31:29] Get out of my house. Right now, right away.
[31:33] Sanaya
[31:37] Sanaya
[31:38] Didn't you listen?
[31:40] Get out of my house.
Get out.
[31:43] Sanaya listen to me.
[31:45] Get out of here.
Sanaya.
[31:47] Sanaya listen to me.
Get out of here.
[31:50] Get out of my house.
Sanaya leave her.
[31:53] Get out of here.
Sanaya listen to me once.
[32:18] Get lost.
[32:19] Get out of my house.
Sanaya don't create scene.
[32:23] Get lost.
[32:29] Sanaya.
Not a single word.
[32:45] Damn
[34:19] If you want to hide that then we will do that but I need your consent.
[34:52] As you know that I can't sleep without you.
[34:56] And if you will have to live and sleep without me then?
That will never happen.
[36:02] Sanaya open the door. Sanaya listen to me.
[36:08] Sanaya give me a chance to explain.
[36:11] Sanaya open the door.
[36:18] This is not right. You will have to listen to me.
[36:23] Sanaya please.
[36:25] Arham I don't want to talk to you.
[36:28] Fabeeha
[36:30] Fabeeha
[36:31] Who is making noise. Come here.
[36:36] Fabeeha
[36:58] Sanaya
[36:59] Give me a chance and listen to me once. Please.
[37:06] Sanaya
[37:09] Sanaya
[37:12] Sanaya, where are you going?
[37:16] Arham
[37:20] Arham
[37:23] Arham, what is going on? Why are you banging door?
[37:30] Arham
[37:42] Your whole plan is wiped out Fabeeha and Arham was just watching quietly without saying a single word in my favor.
[37:52] His wife pushed me out of the house but Arham didn't even call me and ask me about my feelings.
[37:58] He must be appeasing his wife.
[38:00] But what will I do now?
[38:04] It was not that easy to create distances between Sanaya and Arham as you thought of.
[38:25] Sanaya please give me one chance. Don't do this. Don't leave house please.
[38:29] Sanaya I have made a mistake, I admit that. Give me a chance and listen to me. Sanaya.
[38:36] Sanaya give me a chance to explain. Please Sanaya.
[38:41] I won't live here anymore.
[38:42] Sanaya listen to me once.
Arham
[38:47] Will anyone tell me that what is going on here. I am calling you continuously.
[38:51] But no one listened. What is going on?
[38:54] Where is she going?
[38:56] Sanaya
[39:00] I am asking something.
[39:04] Tell me Sanaya, what is going on?
[39:07] It would be better if you will ask your son.
[39:09] I am asking you so tell me.
[39:12] Don't tell her, it's our personal matter.
No it's not.
[39:17] Your mother should know about that.
[39:22] You want to listen. Right?
[39:26] So listen
[39:28] I can't stay in this house for a single second.
[39:34] Because your son has decided to give my place to someone else.
[39:43] That's it.
[39:46] Not anymore.
[39:49] Sanaya. Sanaya.
