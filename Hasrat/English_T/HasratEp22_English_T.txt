[00:13] If you don't want to go with him then refuse.
[00:18] What is there to be afraid of?
[00:22] Besides, some decisions in life..
[00:25] one has to fight.
[00:28] Better than providing excuses everyday, why not get it over with?
[00:32] Am I lying? Have you not seen the state of mother.
[00:35] You might have faith in your wife, but I do not.
[00:40] Fabiha is far much better than her, she at least cares about our mother.
[00:44] I think you should double her money and ask her to stay the night, so that she may insert insulin.
[01:13] Will you have coffee?
[01:16] Thank you.
[01:19] How did you know that I wanted to have a cup of coffee?
[01:23] I was making for one myself and decided to make another for you.
[01:27] How did you know that I liked coffee?
[01:30] You don't know this, but my horoscope is the same as your wife.
[01:37] How did you know that?
[01:39] I found a picture on the lounge. It has a date on it. I'm sure you must have gifted it to her.
[01:47] Thank you.
[01:50] I should be the one thanking you. One needs a partner to have coffee with and you've fulfilled that for  me.
[02:05] It's time for you to go.
[02:08] I'll go home a little late today. After inserting auntie with insulin.
[02:12] Miss Shenaya stays busy and she'll be late today. We can't risk it.
[02:18] Late?
[02:20] Did she not tell you?
I'm sure she told me, it must have slipped my mind.
[02:26] I overheard her talking on the phone. She has dinner at 8.
[02:30] That's why I assumed that she might be late.
[02:34] Don't worry. I'll take care of the insulin duties at night.
[02:50] Father! Father, look at this. My friend gave me this.
[02:56] Very nice...
Happy friendship day auntie Fabiha...
[03:02] Happy friendship day! Is this for me?
Yes.
[03:07] From now on you're my best friend.
[03:11] You are my best friend as well.
[03:15] And mine too.
[03:18] The kids have gotten quite attached to you.
[03:22] Kids go where they find love.
[03:29] "I love you"
I love you too Hadi!
[03:32] Show me what you friend gave you.
My friend gave you this...
[03:36] Wow... this is beautiful... the color are so well done.
[03:42] Very nice.
[04:07] Fabiha...
[04:09] Fabiha...
Yes...
[04:13] What are you thinking about?
Nothing...
[04:18] There is something... tell me, I won't tell anyone.
[04:29] Look at me. Tell me.
[04:33] What's the reason that you seem worried to me?
[04:43] If I tell you something, promise me that you won't tell anyone else.
Why would I? I'm your sister..
[04:51] I can keep that a secret.
[04:54] Auntie said something very weird to me today.
[05:00] What's that?
[05:03] She told me that I should include myself in Arhum's life.
[05:07] Are you saying that mother is paralyzed because of me?
Yes!
[05:10] If you had given my mother her insulin on time, she would be walking today!
[05:17] You should have thought before alleging me with something so big.
Admit that you've made a mistake!
[05:23] What?
[05:25] Did she really say that to you?
[05:32] I can't believe it..
I didn't either.
[05:39] But... why does she want that?
[05:44] She thinks that miss Shenaya can't give her the happiness that I can.
[05:49] You always lie to hide you mistakes... admit your mistake!
Mother...
[06:04] Yes my dear... what's the matter?
[06:08] What happened?
Are you two fighting?
[06:14] No... not at all...
[06:17] Like how you scolded when you do something wrong..
[06:22] just like that father was scolding me.
[06:25] Nothing else... let's go to your room.
Tell me, what did you two eat for dinner?
[06:38] She is right.
[06:46] If a man has money..
[06:50] then it doesn't matter if he's old, or has a second marriage.
[06:54] He would keep you happy as well. He has a home, a car and a good bank balance...
[07:00] Not only will he fulfill your desires, but your dreams as well.
[07:05] But sister...
But what...
[07:09] Look, life doesn't knock often at one's door.
[07:14] Don't let this doubt ruin your life.
[07:19] Don't let this ruin someone's life.
Don't you think that marrying a married man, spoils a women's reputation?
[07:30] I have a question... when Islam allows men to marry four times at a single time...
[07:36] then why do people taunt only the women?
[07:40] That she married a married man.
[07:45] Why is a woman's reputation scrutinized? Why is she kept out of the loop?
[07:51] Why isn't she given the same stature as the first wife.
[07:58] Even though a man is following the teachings of Islam when he's marrying a second woman.
[08:05] And a woman does a lawful thing by marrying.
Look Fabiha...
[08:09] There is no reason for you to go this deep.
[08:13] Just tell me... do you want to do this?
[08:19] Do you want to marry Arhum?
[08:24] I want to marry him and secure all of our futures.
[08:29] And Hamza?
[08:34] What about him?
[08:37] I've tried using my behavior to push him away, but what can I do if he still comes after me?
[08:43] Do you think he'll leave you so easily?
[08:49] I don't want to talk about Hamza for now.
[08:54] Alright.
[08:56] That means that you've decided.
Hamza has no job or status...
[09:02] He'll have to sell his house to repay the loan.
[09:08] Better than living on the streets with him, it would be better if I live in Arhum's palace.
[09:17] You're right... every person has the right to think about their future.
[09:24] It's good that you're thinking about your future.
Look at me...
[09:30] What did I get being loyal to Haris. My life has been ruined.
[09:36] These are not the times for being loyal. One has to be selfish.
[09:43] It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks...
[09:47] That person won't pay for your bills or your ration.
[09:52] People talk and then they leave...
[09:57] People like us fear what people might say and close doors that are better for us.
[10:02] Do you remember my childhood friend Tamanna? Samreen told me that she married a married man.
[10:09] What doesn't she have now? She has a house, bank balance and a huge car...
[10:15] Samreen told me that she goes on a trip every two months. London... US... or Turkey.
[10:22] Fabiha, there is nothing wrong if you have to endure a first wife and her kids to get all these luxuries.
[10:30] Islam give equal stature to both wives...
[10:34] There is nothing wrong with having a lawful relationship.
[10:43] Why are you getting worried?
[10:46] You can think about it later. It's getting late, go to sleep.
[11:35] Arhum.
[11:38] Arhum!
[11:41] Come inside.
[12:03] Yes mother.
[12:06] Come here... sit here.
[12:20] Are you worried?
[12:24] No, I just couldn't sleep.
[12:27] Why?
[12:29] What's the matter? Tell me...
[12:36] You're in this state because of me.
[12:40] I don't like that.
[12:43] Who told you that I'm in this state because of you? Why you taking blame of your wife's actions?
[12:56] Look...
[12:58] There are so many women...
[13:00] They manage their work and home lives so well.
[13:07] What can I say if Shenaya can't do that?
[13:11] Look at Fabiha.
[13:14] She takes care of me all day here and then she goes home to take care of her family.
[13:22] She's even younger than Shenaya.
[13:27] It's all about how she was raised..
[13:30] Her mother raised her well.
[13:35] She is tolerating everything her mother is doing to her.
[13:40] On her say so she's willing to marry.
[13:46] Shall I ask you something?
[13:51] Fabiha so quickly made a place in your heart...
[13:55] Shenaya couldn't do that in all these years.
[13:59] Why is that?
[14:07] She never tried.
[14:11] It is easy to build a relationship with one's husband.
[14:17] But it's hard to accept the relationships around him.
[14:27] Look...
[14:31] how Fabiha takes care of me all day.
[14:36] Sometimes I feel as though she's my daughter-in-law, and not Shenaya.
[14:43] If it were up to me, I would not let her go...
[15:30] What are you doing?
[15:34] I'm trying to cheer you up.
You are wasting your time.
[15:37] I will not cheer up.
[15:39] Cheer up...
[15:42] Leave it...
I won't.
[15:46] Let go of my shirt.
I won't, until you cheer up.
[15:50] Shenaya...
[15:59] Cheer up, otherwise you'll look like a fool in front of the kids...
[16:04] Wear this shirt instead.
Are you two fighting?
[16:07] Like the wrestling we watch...
[16:11] No... who told you this?
We know everything.
[16:15] You are upset with mother.
[16:19] It's nothing like that. I can never be upset with your mother.
[16:24] Then wear this shirt that mother is giving you.
[16:28] I will wear it right now.
[16:34] Thank you... because of you two mother agreed.
[16:39] Let's go...
[16:48] Why aren't you ready yet?
[16:51] Where are you going, getting ready so early in the morning?
[16:56] The kids have their results today. Miss Shenaya is busy, so I'll have to go in her place.
[17:03] Whilst taking care of his mother, have you become a nanny for the kids?
[17:07] When they increased your responsibilities, then why not your salary?
One day won't make a difference.
[17:13] Yes... it does.
[17:15] I don't understand why you're working yourself for other people's kids. 
[17:28] Where are you going so early in the morning?
[17:31] Mother... I asked Samreen to find me a job. She's gotten me into an interview, and that's where I'm going.
[17:37] There is no respectable job for someone who has just passed matriculation.
[17:41] Go and take care of the kitchen. Forget about this.
[17:45] Why mother? Why am I responsible for the respect of our home? I can't work inside the kitchen any longer.
[17:52] I've decided that I will find a job, build my life and establish myself.
[17:59] Like Fabiha, I want to have job.
[18:03] I wait for one daughter the entire day.
[18:08] Is that enough for me? Don't test me further... please go.
[18:14] What's the matter mother? You never had a problem with Fabiha's job, then why me?
[18:20] If I had worked a job like Fabiha since the beginning, then I too would be confident.
[18:25] You are confident right now. That sharp tongue that you have...
[18:31] You know how to use it well.
Mother I've told you... I'll work a job.
[18:38] Working women have a particular approach to life and a desire to move forward.
[18:44] and if I had thought of that before, Haris might not have left me.
[18:49] So I've decided, I'll work a job...
[18:53] Farewell.
[19:02] You have freed yourself from my responsibility a long time ago
[19:05] Go and have fun.
[19:09] Mother, she's leaving for an important meeting.
What did I say?
[19:13] Everyone has their priorities.
[19:16] For some people family is more important, and for some their future.
[19:21] It's all about making the right decision at the right time.
[20:06] Fabiha... listen to me...
[20:10] He stands there like an idiot.
[20:18] What's with you? Do you think it's funny?
Yes we do, what will you do about it?
[20:24] Do you want me to show how funny it is?
[21:34] Hadi...
[21:44] Bye...
[21:55] Open the door.
[21:57] I'm leaving Arhum...
Let me know once you've reached.
[22:56] Fabiha...
[22:58] Are you crying?
[23:00] No... I was chopping onions.
[23:04] You can lie... but not your tears.
If you didn't like something that Shenaya said then for that...
[23:12] It's nothing like that... you have it wrong...
[23:15] What is the matter, tell me? Is it something personal?
[23:23] Did you talk to mother?
[23:28] If I tell you, will it fix it?
[23:33] It might not, but it might life a burden.
[23:41] When one has an ill fate, then all burden become very cheap.
[23:47] How long can you stay strong when you have burden on top of you?
[23:51] But I'll have to.
[23:54] A lot of people are counting on me...
[23:59] I'm the son of my house.
[24:28] Did you talk to Arhum?
[24:29] I called him so many times, but he isn't picking up. I was thinking of visiting him.
[24:34] What will that do? Will he listen to you? He will never listen.
[24:41] It's a matter of my daughter, we can't just leave him like this.
[24:45] I was thinking of taking Arhum out for dinner somewhere.
[24:51] Let's do that.
I think you should let them be.
[25:01] It's not only about Arhum, Shenaya's happiness is linked to him.
[25:07] I don't want Shenaya to listen to anything because of us.
[25:12] I was thinking of going with you tomorrow to invite Arhum and his mother.
[25:19] You can try, but he will not come.
For the time being we have to do something.
[25:25] Take me to his home... 
[25:28] tomorrow.
[25:37] May I come in sir?
Yes.
[25:39] The client from Islamabad liked the project you sent over. Congratulations!
[25:45] They want to have a meeting as well.
Really sir... that's great!
[25:50] This project is very important for us. You have put in a lot of effort.
[25:54] I expect you to lock this deal.
If God is willing.
[25:59] One more thing... you have a meeting with the client tonight. I have confirmed your tickets.
[26:05] Sufiya and Zain are going with you as well. You have to go.
[26:11] Go home and start packing.
[26:15] Sure sir.
Thank you.
[27:17] Hello.
[27:19] Arhum...
What is it?
[27:23] I wanted to tell you that auntie's medicine are finished. Be sure to get them on your way back.
[27:29] Alright I will.
[27:34] Nothing.
[28:19] Yes Shenaya?
There is a problem..
[28:23] I have to go to an urgent meeting in Islamabad tonight and stay there for two days. It's a huge client!
[28:30] Alright, don't worry. Go there...
[28:34] But... Arhum, how can I leave the kids alone?
[28:40] I don't understand.
Don't worry..
[28:43] I'll take care of the kids... do you work.
[28:51] Arhum, are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure... relax and go.
[28:57] Thank you Arhum.
[28:59] Okay...
Bye, take care.
[29:02] Thank you.
[29:11] Fabiha, will you pass me the make up pouch? Thank you.
[29:15] You have to wake up on time, eat on time and sleep on time. Don't bother your father.
[29:19] Have you prepared my dress?
[29:23] I'm so sorry?
What will I wear now?
[29:26] I forgot.
[29:28] Fabiha... will you do me a favor? Could you wash Hadi's sport dress?
[29:35] Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. It's important for you to go.
[29:39] Thank you so much.
Mother...
[29:42] Why are you going? How will we live alone?
[29:46] You're not alone, father is with you.
But you're not
[29:51] I'll be back soon.
When will you be back?
[29:57] On Sunday.
[29:59] Promise?
Promise.
[30:02] Mother, can't we come with you?
[30:05] How can you go? You have to go to school and attend classes.
[30:10] If you don't go to school, then your marks will be deducted from your final exams.
[30:15] Take away the kids Fabiha.
Come on kids... let your mom pack.
[30:22] Fabiha, close the door on your way out.
[31:04] What?
[31:06] I've pressed your clothes for work tomorrow. The socks are in the drier, the shoes are in their place.
[31:16] At dinner, I've made your favorite food. Shami Kebab.
Thank you.
[31:22] I've inserted mother with insulin.
[31:25] The night dress is ready as well. You have to take care of the kids as well.
[31:31] You're the one who takes best care of them. But I'll be able to manage.
[31:36] When are you coming back?
Sunday...
[31:42] That means that I'll have to stay awake till Sunday.
[31:45] Why would you? You have the kids...
[31:48] You have to be with the kids. You know they feel afraid alone.
[31:56] Don't worry... I'll manage everything. Now go.
[32:01] Miss me.
[32:05] Why?
When you leave, there will be someone else in your place..
[32:09] I'll kill her.
[32:14] You know that no one can take your place.
[32:19] Meet mother before you leave... you're running late for your flight.
[32:24] Whilst playing sister Farheen hurt her foot and she started crying...
[32:29] Mother heard her...
You pushed her right?
[32:33] I didn't.
[32:36] I can see that... keep this to the side.
[32:49] Mother... I'm going to Islamabad.
[32:54] Yes go... who can stop you.
[33:00] Don't worry about here, Arhum will take care of the kids and the home.
[33:07] Go... and you've been free from my responsibility a long time ago. Go and have fun.
[33:15] Mother, she's going because of an important meeting.
What did I say?
[33:19] Everyone has their priorities. To some people family is the most important thing...
[33:24] for other it's their future.
[33:27] It's all about making the right decision at the right time.
[33:32] Right?
[33:39] Alright mother, we'll get going.
[33:42] Farewell. May God protect you.
[33:53] Call Fabiha... where is she? Why isn't she here yet?
[33:58] Find out where she is... what's the matter mother?
[34:01] Why are you always worried about her?
[34:06] You don't care about my job or anything else... you're always concerned about Fabiha.
[34:11] I've gotten a job... I'm not dependent on anyone else.
[34:16] May God have mercy. She takes two buses to come back home.
[34:20] I'm so worried until she comes home.
[34:25] Then make her stay home. Why do you allow her to leave?
[34:29] She runs the entire house. The one who I didn't allow to leave..
[34:33] it's not like she cared about our respect.
[34:36] In the end all your anger strikes down on me.
[34:41] Call her... I don't have the credit, otherwise I would have.
[34:49] Where's my phone?
[34:51] Ask her.
[35:31] Mother, she's not picking up and why are you pacing... your blood pressure will rise.
[35:39] It's late, she should be home by now.
[35:43] Even if she does, it's not like she'll tell you the truth. I know she'll make excuses.
[35:49] That there was traffic... auntie got sick, or something with the kids.
[35:53] But she will not tell you the truth.
[35:56] What do you mean?
[35:59] I had forgotten that Fabiha always tells the truth.
[36:03] I'm the only liar her. She's the master of her fate.
[36:09] And I don't have that luck.
What I says goes around here.
[36:14] She works from 9 in the morning till 6 in the evening.
[36:19] It's late, she should be home by now. Fabiha knows this.
[36:24] Mother... I think that it's important for you to remind her.
[36:33] This freedom isn't good. You won't be able to do anything...
[36:38] if something bad happens.
[36:52] Where were you?
I was washing the kids' clothes.
[36:56] Why? Why were you washing it? The maid comes home for that.
[37:01] Miss Shenaya asked me, so I couldn't refuse.
[37:06] She pays me, hence I'm bound to do some work.
[37:10] She's the owner of this house.
[37:14] I've noticed that Arhum doesn't ignore anything she says.
[37:21] That's the pride I have to break.
[37:26] Forget that, did you have something for me?
[37:28] Yes, open my closet and keep this.
[37:32] Why? I just made you change.
[37:36] Open up... there is a red box, right next to the clothes, bring it.
[37:50] Yes, that one... give it to me.
[37:55] Sit down.
[38:03] These are my favorite earrings.
[38:08] Arhum's father bought it for me. I've worn it a lot of times, but not anymore I'm afraid.
[38:15] I want  to give you this.
[38:17] No auntie, I can't take it. Miss Shenaya will be angry if she finds out
[38:22] Here you go... I'm happy to give it to you. No one deserves an opinion.
[38:28] No need to worry.
[38:33] These are ordinary.
[38:36] But my desires and dreams are much bigger.
[38:40] Only Arhum can fulfill those.
