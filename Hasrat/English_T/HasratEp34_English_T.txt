[00:13] I have made my decision brother.
And what is your decision?
[00:25] I want divorce from Arham.
[00:29] Please forgive me.
[00:35] Please.
[00:39] I don't need this.
[01:15] The mother who loved you so much and took very good care of you and she borne so much for you.
[01:32] She fulfilled each and every desire of yours.
[01:36] You misbehaved that much with her.
[01:43] Just because of that cheap and lowly girl.
[01:50] Who has just included in your life.
[01:58] A mother is called very lucky who has a son.
[02:08] But my mother was so lucky
[02:13] That she kept begging in front of you for your time
[02:20] But you didn't have any time for her.
[02:38] So she left 
[02:44] But remember one thing
[02:50] That karma is part of life.
[02:59] Whatever you are doing
[03:02] You will have to face all of this one day.
[03:09] And you will have to bear that.
[03:14] You will have to face everything.
[04:09] Hadiya nothing will happen. Trust me.
[04:25] I don't know how aunt must be feeling now. Arham is not receiving my calls.
[04:36] Muskan, come here my child.
[04:41] What's the matter?
You are a bad person.
[04:46] My mom never shouts like you.
[04:52] Will you also scold me just like you scolded that uncle?
[04:56] No my dear, why would I scold you? I will never scold you, I promise.
[05:00] Uncle was misbehaving with me that's why I scolded him.
[05:04] If I hadn't scolded him then he would have scared me, you and all of us. Didn't you see that he ran away.
[05:09] Now, he will never come again.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's my promise.
[05:13] Kiss me.
You don't have to be afraid. OK?
[06:04] You have made that decision Sanaya but how will you live with the support of this decision?
[06:15] Will you keep crying like this throughout your life?
Mom, I have no regret on my decision.
[06:23] This is just a temporary pain.
[06:28] But it is much better than that torment which I would have to face by staying with Arham.
But this society is very cruel.
[06:39] It's not easy for a lone woman to live in this society.
[06:46] But you are taking it lightly.
[06:50] When your children will grow up and you will find a proposal for Hareem then everyone will ask about her father.
[07:04] Then how will you respond to those questions and how will you satisfy everyone?
[07:11] Then what will you do?
[07:17] That your husband was disloyal to you.
[07:23] Or Hareem's father was not a good person that's why you couldn't live with him.
[07:31] Husband is the biggest protector for a woman.
[07:41] It's not easy to live without a man.
[07:49] An unmarried girl can live somehow but this society makes life a living hell for a divorced woman.
Mom, please stop it.
[08:00] Divorce is not a sin, it's my right and I want to use that.
[08:11] Just like Arham has used his right in the same way I want to use my right.
[08:19] So what's wrong with it?
[08:25] If I can't have equal rights as my husband has but I can raise my voice for my right.
[08:31] And as far as Hareem's marriage is concerned then I am only taking my right back from Arham. I am not snatching Arham's right of being my children' father.
[08:39] He is father of my children and he will always be there father. I won't let my children' childhood destroy because of this conflict mom.
[08:51] Let's assume that if I compromise today then what is the guarantee that if Arham will have kids from his second wife then my children won't feel any inferiority.
[09:08] Mom, I don't want to take any risk.
[09:15] And I won't become a burden on you and brother.
[09:22] But your support will save me from shattering.
[09:57] Doctor.
What is your relation with patient?
I am her son and she is her daughter.
[10:04] I am so sad. I am sorry. She couldn't survive because of severe heart attack.
[10:18] She is no more.
[10:50] What have you done brother?
Hadiya.
What have you done? You want this to happen. Right?
[11:00] You want this to happen. You set yourself free from your responsibility. You killed your mother.
[11:08] Hadiya.
What have you done?
[11:12] You snatched my mother from me.
[11:17] You snatched my mother.
[11:46] Be patient.
[11:51] Mom.
Don't cry.
[12:16] Hi
[12:58] Who is calling you?
Arham
[13:02] Talk to him.
[13:04] I don't want to talk to him.
[13:19] Talk to Arham.
[13:29] As I told you that I don't want to talk to Arham.
[13:32] Sanaya, talk to him.
[13:36] Sanaya
[13:54] You should talk to Arham.
[13:58] I don't want to talk to him and I don't want to maintain any relation with him as well.
[14:05] Mom.
What happened?
Brother Arham called me.
[14:16] Aunt has passed away.
[14:38] We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.
[14:40] What did Arham tell you?
He didn't tell anything.
[14:48] But we will have to go there.
Yes sure.
[14:56] What happened Sanaya?
[14:58] I will ask Junaid to bring car.
[15:08] Have courage my child.
How did it happen so suddenly?
[15:19] How did it happen
[15:26] I don't understand.
Be brave my child.
[15:31] She was bed ridden.
[15:35] What should I do mom? Should I go there?
Yes, we should go there.
[15:41] We must go there.
[15:45] And she is Arham's mother anyway.
[16:11] Mom, are you going somewhere?
Yes.
[16:15] Where are you going at the moment?
To Hamza's house.
[16:20] Don't you think that you shouldn't go there after what Fabiha did to Hamza?
[16:26] Farheen
[16:28] Parent's always repay for the sins of their children.
[16:37] That's why I am going to Hamza's house to apologize.
[16:42] That will lessen my burden a bit.
[16:45] But what Hamza said anything out of anger then? I don't think that you should go there so please.
[16:54] Whatever Fabiha has done to Hamza, after that if he will curse me then I will listen quietly.
[17:11] What can I say? As you wish.
[17:16] Fabiha embarrassed me in front of Hamza.
[17:27] So
[17:28] Parents have to face such humiliation.
[17:36] OK then but how will you go alone. Let me go with you.
No, I will go alone.
[19:20] My mother died because of your daughter.
[19:29] Are you apologizing for that?
[19:35] Or are you apologizing that she married to a married man by leaving me alone?
[19:44] What?
[20:45] Mom left us sister.
[20:49] Control yourself Hadiya.
[20:59] How can I do that?
[21:10] Look at her daughter-in-law, she is attending funeral like a guest.
[21:16] Don't you know that her daughter-in-law has left this house long ago.
[21:25] Mrs Shamim told me about that.
What?
[21:29] But why? She was so nice.
[21:36] When Arham imposed other woman on her head then she had no other option left.
[21:44] She is Arham's second wife. They hired her as a care taker earlier.
[21:50] Now she is taking care of her husband.
Leave it sister.
[21:54] The woman who work in offices face such situation. When they search for peace outside then their own house disturbs.
[22:02] That's why sister Riffat was against her daughter-in-law's job.
You are right.
[22:17] Let me meet Arham.
[23:05] Control yourself Arham.
[23:10] You have to take care of everyone.
Mom has left us.
[23:32] If you will become weak then who will take care of Hadiya?
[23:42] Mom has left us.
[23:51] And you are leaving me as well.
[24:07] Everyone is leaving me.
[24:25] Perhaps I deserve this.
[24:37] That I can't stop anyone.
[25:43] Mom must be feeling pain by seeing you in this condition.
[25:48] Control yourself.
[27:00] Aunt it's time.
[27:28] Brother
[27:34] Brother where are you taking her?
Hadiya control yourself.
[27:38] Mom
[27:42] Recite Kalma.
Mom.
[27:47] Brother.
Recite Kalma
[28:07] All of this has happened because of this witch.
[28:08] Get lost from here. Why have you come to our house?
[28:13] Why have you come to our house? You have destroyed happiness of our house.
[28:16] Hadiya, control yourself.
My mother died because of you. Get lost from here.
[28:24] Don't you understand, get lost from here.
[28:43] Brother
[29:01] Why are you here?
[29:08] Just leave.
[29:16] Every relation between us has been ended.
Actually
[29:23] I am not here to take anything.
[29:29] I know
[29:32] It's very difficult to gather scattered things.
[29:40] I am here to apologize.
[29:48] You want me to forgive you.
[29:55] But for what you want me to forgive you? Tell me.
[30:06] My mother died because of your daughter.
[30:14] Apology for that.
[30:20] Or she married to a married man by leaving me alone, are you apologizing for that?
[30:28] What?
[30:31] What did you say? Say that again.
[30:38] Your daughter got married.
[30:49] She has settled in her life by ruining my life.
[30:58] And you want me to forgive you.
[31:12] If you are here for this hope then OK, I am not that lowly that I can't forgive anyone.
[31:24] If you will get satisfaction from my words then I forgive you.
[31:35] But I will never forgive your daughter.
[31:58] Mom
[32:03] Dad sleeps here and younger mom sleeps there while I sleep here.
[32:16] Mom you are here now then younger mom will sleep in guest room.
[32:23] Mom
[32:26] What happened mom?
[32:28] Nothing my dear. Let's go, aunt hasn't eaten since morning. Let's give her something to eat.
[32:55] Eat something Hadiya.
[33:01] I don't want to eat.
[33:15] Mom won't come back if you will keep yourself hungry.
[33:26] But you can come back. Right?
[33:52] All doors are closed.
[34:01] I have no one here who loves me.
[34:06] Sister
[34:11] Don't you think that you have left everything very easily?
[34:28] A woman has the biggest strength to save her relation is her children.
[34:40] And you have that strength.
[34:49] If you leave your place then that won't remain empty.
[34:58] No one says that man is disloyal.
[35:05] Everyone thinks that woman is guilty.
[35:12] When woman doesn't pay attention towards her husband then husband doesn't spare any time to pay his attention towards other women.
[35:26] It's your fault as well sister.
[35:32] You couldn't maintain balance between your job and husband.
[35:41] We associate man's nature with woman's mistake and we forgive his every mistake. And even then we spoil them.
[35:57] No matter how hard working a woman is but she is held responsible for all mistakes.
[36:08] What do you think that only your life is ruined.
[36:16] No
[36:18] Think about your children. Think about Hareem.
[36:27] You don't want to come back here and Hareem doesn't want to leave this house.
[36:37] And she is living with a woman whose lover comes here so often.
[36:46] This is making a very negative impact on her mind.
[36:53] Sister please think about her. Who can protect Hareem except you and brother.
[37:05] If you won't think about her then who will think?
[37:19] Please sister.
[37:24] Don't make any decision for yourself, do that for your children.
[37:33] Hareem needs you.
[38:17] What are you saying mom? Fabiha got married.
[38:23] Yes
[38:25] Hamza has told you about that?
I can't believe it.
[38:34] I am thinking about Hamza.
[38:39] He always supported Fabiha.
[38:43] He stood with her in every difficulty and every sorrow.
[38:49] But Fabiha betrayed him.
[38:55] He has fallen down so he must be injured badly.
[39:00] I am afraid that what Fabiha has done she will have to face it's consequences.
[39:11] Because the path chosen by Fabiha is not that easy.
[39:19] A shared man can only make any one of his wives happy.
[39:25] Fabiha can't live happily.
[39:29] Honestly speaking, I feel pity for Hamza. He must be feeling very lonely at the moment.
[39:37] I can't do anything for him except to pray for him.
[39:46] I don't have anything left for him.
[39:56] Don't take tension, your health will deteriorate.
