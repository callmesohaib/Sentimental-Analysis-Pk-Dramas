[00:13] I made the mistake mom.
[00:15] But I will correct my mistake at any cost.
[00:19] It's useless to say anything to you because it's my fault as I have ruined my own house.
[00:25] My children and wife are not with me.
[00:28] I am living like a stranger in my own house.
[00:31] Only because of you.
[00:33] Remember one thing Fabiha, that I won't let my children grow under your supervision.
[00:40] I don't want this baby know about his mother's reality.
[00:43] Don't say this Arham.
Arham, where are you going? Listen to me.
[01:13] Mam, don't worry, everything will be fine and nothing will happen to Arham.
[01:18] Control yourself please. Sit here.
[01:38] Where is Arham? How is he right now? How did that happen?
All of this has happened because of you. What did you get by doing this Fabiha?
[01:48] No one is cruel Sanaya.
[01:50] A person is compelled to be cruel because of bad time.
You can't hide your mistakes by accusing time.
[01:58] If anything happened to Arham then I will never forgive you Fabiha.
[02:36] I know that you hate and you are right in doing so.
[02:43] But I want to ask a question from you.
[02:48] We hate that person who wrongs us but why don't we curse that time which made a person bad?
[03:01] Why don't we blame time which forces us to do wrong things.
[03:07] Time is not bad Fabiha, the intention of a person is bad and your intention was bad.
[03:19] My intention was not bad Sanaya.
[03:23] So many people misguided me.
[03:30] And first of all, aunt Riffat gave me hope.
[03:37] And after that I couldn't think about anything else.
[03:43] And then her behavior became bad with me.
[03:49] I realized that she was only using me to keep Arham away from you.
Stop it please, I don't trust you at all.
[03:59] And don't use a dead person just to prove yourself innocent.
[04:06] I am not asking you to believe me.
[04:10] I am telling you about what happened to me.
[04:17] We don't feel sad when our dreams are broken because perhaps we believe that dream will end as soon as we wake up.
[04:27] But if someone try to break hopes after raising those hopes in our heart then how long can a person remain good.
[04:36] I tried my best to get you out of Arham's heart and his life but I couldn't do that.
[04:46] Yes he was alongside me but he was not mine.
[04:53] And it's not love by talking to someone in a sweet tone.
[04:59] Love is that reality which remains in our heart even if we are alone.
[05:06] And I always found Arham alone even though he was with me.
[05:10] I kept getting jealous
[05:13] But I couldn't take your place.
[05:17] He didn't do bad to you only.
[05:26] So how can I be happy after breaking so many hearts.
[05:35] You are also guilty of being cruel to another person.
[05:44] This baby.
[05:51] Now it's his turn to get suffered because of your mistakes.
[06:51] Fabiha, I am afraid that your health will deteriorate. You are sitting here since last night. Let's go home.
[07:00] Mom, I won't leave until Arham regains his consciousness.
But you also need to take rest.
[07:07] Come on, let's go.
[07:08] Hamza will drop us.
Mom, as I said, I won't go anywhere.
[07:20] Who is patient Arham's wife?
[07:25] Patient has regained his consciousness and now he is out of danger.
[07:33] He is insisting to meet Sanaya. Go and meet him.
[07:43] Let me see dad first then I will take you there. OK. Sit here.
[08:28] Happy birthday.
[08:39] Don't worry, I won't die so soon.
[08:43] God forbid.
Nothing will happen to you.
[08:50] You will be alright.
[09:34] You will be fully recovered dad.
[09:37] When I get sick, you spent time with me and I get complete recovery..
[09:43] So you will be fully recovered as well.
[09:46] Dad, when you will recover completely then we will play wrestling.
[09:53] Yes my son.
[09:55] Sure.
[09:58] Mom
[10:00] Take doctor's permission about taking dad to home.
[10:03] We will take very good care of dad at home.
[10:07] Don't bother dad and don't talk too much. Stay with dad, I m going to meet with doctor. I'll be right back.
[10:19] Come here, come to me.
[10:37] How is Arham feeling now?
[10:41] He is feeling better, it will take some time to get recovered.
This will also pass.
[10:49] But I will praise your fate.
[10:53] Time remained at your side even though it betrayed you but it was against me.
[11:01] I want to give something to you.
[11:07] What is this?
Some relations are only made as a formality.
[11:12] Which raise hopes in our hearts.
[11:18] And today I am ending that hope.
[11:23] Please forgive me, if you can.
[11:29] Won't you meet with Arham?
[11:34] No, I have lost all my rights today.
[11:42] I will be satisfied that I showed some dignity by saving someone else' relation.
[12:00] Fabiha
[12:10] You can meet with Arham, if you want.
[12:39] Why have you come here?
[12:41] No my child, don't say that.
[12:45] Go out.
[12:48] Eat something from canteen. Hadi you go as well.
[12:57] How are you?
Still alive.
[13:05] But you don't have to worry about me.
Obviously.
[13:11] The whole world must be considering me culprit after what I did.
[13:17] But no one would understand that how compelled I was.
[13:22] But everyone only remember one thing that I was wrong.
[13:26] No matter what you do, you can't prove yourself a good person after getting married second time.
[13:33] Man is always a betrayer and a women is always characterless. Woman also faces taunts.
[13:40] And this is a custom of this society.
[13:48] But I realized this after a long time.
[13:53] First I tried my best that Sanaya may stay with you but then I wanted her to leave you.
[14:00] And maybe I was wrong.
[14:04] And I am apologizing for that.
[14:08] I shouldn't have come between you and Sanaya. That was the biggest mistake of my life.
[14:14] I thought bad for a woman despite being a woman myself.
[14:20] I didn't know that man can astray that easily.
[14:23] And he changes.
[14:27] But now I have understood everything.
[14:33] I am setting you free from my relation.
[14:39] Take care of yourself.
[14:42] And please forgive me, if you can.
[15:10] Fabiha, where did you go?
[15:15] I called you so many times but you didn't respond.
[15:20] At least you should have informed me before leaving. You amazed me.
[15:26] Where were you?
[15:32] Fabiha, where did you go?
I went to hospital mom.
[15:36] Hospital?
[15:38] Is everything alright? Is Arham alright?
[15:41] He is fine, don't worry.
[15:45] But why did you go there without informing me?
[15:54] I have made the decision about my life.
[15:58] Decision? Which decision?
[16:03] I have set Arham and Sanaya free.
[16:13] I am sending separation notice.
[16:29] I have buried all my desires.
[16:54] Sanaya, the distance between you and me at the moment.
[17:03] I won't bear that.
[17:09] I have a request.
[17:14] Don't punish my children for my sins.
[17:19] Don't keep their father away from them.
[17:21] You are not feeling well. Get up, let me take you to doctor.
[17:28] Fabiha
[17:29] Fabiha. Fabiha.
[17:31] Fabiha. Mom.
[17:38] Yeah. Good.
[17:44] Hadi will lose.
[17:48] Stop playing, I have brought soup for dad.
Bring it here, we all will have that together.
[17:54] Yes mom, let's have that together.
[17:59] No not at all, we will go to dining table for that.
[18:03] Go and wash your hands.
Right.
[18:17] Sanaya have you really forgiven me?
[18:22] This is not the right time to discuss this matter.
[18:29] Sanaya, my heart will be burdened until you won't forgive me.
[18:34] This wound won't heal.
[18:38] To apologize is not difficult. It's difficult to spend time.
[18:46] I have spent my life with you and now I can spend my life with you as well.
[18:52] But I can't live with this guilt that when Arham needed Sanaya then Sanaya was not there to support him.
[19:00] Then there would be no difference between Arham and Sanaya.
[19:05] I am sorry Sanaya.
[19:08] I have made the mistakes.
[19:14] I wish that you wouldn't need to apologize.
[19:20] Mom, mom, Hadi has dropped soap in toilet.
[19:27] Check them.
[19:33] Have it.
[21:50] Arham, what are you doing? You haven't slept yet?
I want to go out.
[21:57] OK, let me take you there.
No, I will go.
[22:01] Let me take you. Come with me.
[22:19] Be careful.
[22:23] It's OK.
I will bring your medicine.
[23:05] Be careful.
[23:34] Sit here. Please.
[23:46] What kind of person are you?
[23:53] Sometime, I feel as if I couldn't know you completely even after so many years of our married life.
[24:00] You should have left me there to die.
[24:05] You are doing this, taking care of me and giving me medicine.
[24:15] It's obvious because I want you to get recovered quickly.
[24:24] Sanaya, if you are doing this for the sake of humanity then leave it and don't do this
[24:40] Whatever I have done and the mistake I have made.
[24:45] Now I also feel that I should get punishment.
[24:55] Sanaya, I had a proud feeling that I am a man and I manage all household expenses.
[25:06] And you are just a woman and mother of my children.
[25:16] But now I admit that I was wrong.
[25:24] I am nothing without you Sanaya.
[25:29] I realize this all the time.
[25:36] Sanaya I apologized again and again and I again and again said that I have made the mistake so forgive me.
[25:49] I tried to fix everything but you are right.
[26:02] Because if you would have made this mistake then perhaps I wouldn't forgive you as well.
[26:11] I won't say that distances were created between us due to the events took place between you and mom. I won't say that you didn't give me time.
[26:29] You neglected me. No. Nothing. It is my mistake.
[26:39] Maybe I was weak.
[26:49] I
[26:53] No man admits this thing but
[26:59] He is weak.
[27:03] Sanaya the distance created between you and me now
[27:12] I won't tolerate with that anymore.
[27:18] I have a request.
[27:23] Don't punish my children for my sins.
[27:28] Don't take their father away from them.
[27:35] I immensely love my children.
[27:41] And as far as our relation is concerned then
[27:50] I have nothing left except my time for you. And all my time is for you.
[27:59] I will wait no matter you may take a year, two years, ten years or may be your whole life but
[28:11] Whenever you may feel that your old Arham is back then come back to me.
[29:03] Mom, we are here to share a good news with you.
[29:06] You are going to be a granny.
Wow that's great. Thank God a million times.
[29:12] You have blessed us with so many happiness. Thank you Lord.
[29:17] Is Hania alright?
Yes, she is very happy.
[29:21] Mom, where is Fabiha, let me share this good news with her.
She is in her room. Meet her.
[29:30] Is Hania happy in her house?
Yes she is very happy.
[29:34] They take very good care of her.
Thank God. It's good that she is happy. May God keep her happy.
[29:42] Did you take Farheen to doctor?
[29:43] Yes, we consulted with doctor, she said that nothing to worry about. We have to take care of her.
[29:49] May God bless her.
Let me bring something to eat.
[30:01] Fabiha.
Sister, when did you come?
[30:06] I have just arrived. Tell me how is your health now?
[30:12] I am feeling nervous as if something is wrong.
[30:16] It happens in this condition.
[30:22] You are saying this as if you also know about it.
[30:25] Well, if I don't even know then I will know about it now.
Really? I am really happy to hear that.
[30:36] Fabiha
[30:38] I am really embarrassed for what happened during last few days.
[30:43] Those were very useless misconceptions. Please forgive me, if you can.
[30:48] You don't have to apologize sister.
[30:52] And I know that neither you did anything wrong nor you did say anything wrong.
[30:58] And if I loved anyone unconditionally in this world then they are you and mom and I never mind your words.
[31:05] You are such lovely sister of mine.
[31:08] I should apologize to Hamza.
[31:13] What happened Fabiha? Aren't you feeling well?
[31:16] Let me take you to doctor. Come on get up.
[31:21] Fabiha
[31:22] Fabiha. Fabiha
[31:24] Fabiha. Mom.
[31:25] Fabiha get up.
[31:27] What happened?
Mom, Fabiha is unconscious.
[31:30] Fabiha get up.
Call ambulance.
[31:35] Call ambulance.
[31:39] Dad, please play with us.
No, you play.
[31:43] Dad can't play.
Dad please.
[31:46] Hadi, dad can't play. Take dad there and let him sit.
[31:51] Good. Very good.
[31:53] Be careful.
[32:00] Go and play. I will sit here.
[32:02] Let's play mom.
[32:03] Dad will become a referee and will supervise our game. OK ready.
[32:09] Yeah.
Good catch Hareem
[32:47] Mom, don't worry, nothing will happen. Just pray to God, everything will be alright.
[32:59] Who is with that patient?
We are with her.
She has been blessed with a daughter.
[33:04] But it's a premature delivery so we have put her in incubator and she is getting treatment.
[33:12] Right. And what about my daughter?
[33:17] I am really sorry, we couldn't save her life.
[33:24] She is no more.
[33:52] What did she say?
[34:03] Farheen, what did she say?
[34:07] Fabiha
[34:10] Fabiha has passed away.
[34:16] This is not possible.
[34:19] She can't go like this.
Mom, she can't go.
[34:25] But what was she saying?
How is it possible mom? Maybe there is some misunderstanding.
[34:34] Fabiha
[34:36] You never got happy in your life.
[36:37] What happened Sanaya?
[36:41] Hamza called me.
[36:46] What did he say?
[36:50] Fabiha has blessed with a daughter.
[36:57] Thank God.
[37:00] But Arham
[37:04] But what?
[37:08] Fabiha passed away during delivery procedure.
[37:28] Mom, please eat something, you haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
[37:33] Take it back, I don't want to eat.
[37:36] Mom, don't do this, please eat.
Farheen
[37:41] Bring my Fabiha back.
[37:44] Bring my daughter back.
[37:48] She died while fighting with time and circumstances.
[37:54] That time should also get punishment for misguiding her.
[38:03] But who will give that punishment.
[38:06] Who will give punishment?
[38:10] Fabiha.
Control yourself.
[38:15] Fabiha will never come back, she has gone very far away. But mom
[38:21] I am sure that she is in peace now.
[38:26] O God, what should I do?
[38:41] You?
[38:44] I want to meet aunt.
Yes, please come in.
[38:55] Sit here.
[39:10] I am really sorry that Fabiha has passed away.
[39:14] What will a mother do to condolences when her life is ruined.
[39:23] Yes I know that you are suffering more than anyone else.
[39:32] But that girl is suffering even more than you, who has lost her mother.
[39:43] And I won't be able to live with this guilt that she may also lose her father.
[39:55] So
[40:02] I want to seek your permission for taking that girl with me.
[40:11] I know that only you have the right to take care of this girl at the moment.
[40:16] But this time is not right to think about ourselves.
[40:20] It's time to think about that innocent girl.
[40:24] She deserves her father's love and care.
[40:29] And I want that no one can deprive her from her right.
[41:11] Arham
[41:32] Won't you hold her?
Mom. Mom.
[41:37] Mom, whose baby is this?
She is your younger sister.
[41:42] No, she is so small so you can't hold her.
[41:46] We have to take very good care of her.
Mom, what is her name?
[41:52] Her name is Maryam.
[41:59] Wow, it's a very beautiful name.
[42:02] Maryam.
[42:03] Will she play with us?
Yes of course.
When she will grow up then I will play with her.
[42:09] Yes we will play with her.
[42:22] Your worth has increased even more after this act of yours. She is so lucky that she has got a mother like you.
