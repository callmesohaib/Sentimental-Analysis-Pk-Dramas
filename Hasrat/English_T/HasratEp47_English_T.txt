[02:36] hmm... I remember, tell me shall I talk to boss about your promotion?
[02:45] do you think boss will agree if you say so?
[02:49] yes yes, nowadays I am his favorite
[02:55] whatever you want to get done, just say it. It will be done
[03:00] I don't want anyone to do anything anymore, Hamza
[03:04] in fact, please end this story of pick & drop as well
[03:17] I will manage my commute to office myself
[03:21] it doesn't look good
[03:25] do one thing, stop the car here as the bus is about to come. I will go to the store myself
[03:29] but Farheen, what's wrong with you? What are you saying? I cannot drop you in the middle of our journey?
[03:34] Hamza please try to understand my point. Ok stop the car, let me explain you
[03:40] See... it doesn't look good
[03:45] What must the office people be thinking? So it's better for me to manage my commute myself
[03:51] Farheen, what's wrong with you? Who is putting such things into your mind. What are you saying?
[03:59] you are my responsibility, I cannot leave you in the middle of the way
[04:02] Hamza, please try to understand my point
[04:08] I won't be able to travel with you anymore

[06:36] Hadi's mood is a bit off today
[06:39] Hadi's mood is off? Let me fix it right away

[06:48] if your mom had scolded you, then I will also scold your mother
[06:54] I wanted to play with Fabiha aunty, but Granny Mom brought me here forcefully
[07:08] really! have you brought him forcefully?
[07:12] go & play in Anaya's room, as there are so many toys there
[07:16] Anaya fights with me
[07:18] really? Anaya fights with you
[07:25] what's wrong with Hadi? Is he being so cranky nowadays?
[07:28] you know
[07:30] his exams are round the corner, I was a bit strict so his mood got off
[07:38] its ok, don't take tension. Everything will be fine once the exams will be over. Ok?
[07:43] would you like to drink tea?
[07:44] mom, let me make some pop corns too. Hadi will also feel happy
[07:49] thank you so much, sister
[07:51] do fry some kebabs for my daughter, she loves them
[07:55] Oh... mom's daughter is here
[08:05] so sister Shaheen, how are you doing?
[08:07] I'm fine, Are you fine?
[08:09] yes
[08:10] do you remember Gul-e-Rana, our old neighbors?
[08:14] yes
[08:14] her daughter's marriage got fixed with Jahan Ara's son
[08:20] sister Shaheen, tell me... you've called me after such a long time
[08:25] Yes, I called you here because I had some important work
[08:30] yes yes, tell me
[08:33] by the way, I can't see Farheen anywhere. I wanted to drink some tea
[08:40] Farheen has started a job, so she is usually at work at this time
[08:46] honestly speaking, I am so worried about her
[08:52] until when I will sit here & take care of her
[09:00] tell me some good proposal for Farheen
[09:03] sister Shaheen, please don't mind
[09:10] but the entire neighborhood knows
[09:12] That your younger daughter has left you after humiliating you.
[09:21] and then Farheen's divorce
[09:23] now tell me, from where we'll get a good proposal?
[09:36] tell me truly
[09:38] if you say so, then we can get a widower
[09:47] I do have some proposals
[09:52] yesterday Shakir's sister had called & asked me to show the girl
[09:59] if you say so, then shall I talk to them?
[10:03] Yes, but what does the guy do?
[10:07] the guy owns a pan shop, he keeps children stuff in it
[10:14] And there are two unmarried sisters in the house, the other two are married
[10:20] He has two married brothers, so their wives and kids are also there
[10:27] and his father is has already died
[10:31] so its just a small house
[10:35] call it a zoo!
[10:39] tell me about some small family
[10:42] then let me tell you about Noreen
[10:46] Noreen's brother is there
[10:49] his wife died four months ago
[10:55] she died after leaving a daughter behind
[11:01] she also wants some girl for her brother
[11:03] only he & his sister lives in that house
[11:06] your daughter will live a luxurious life
[11:10] if you say so then shall I proceed with the matter?
[11:12] you may, but..
[11:16] don't tell about Fabiha
[11:19] hey, don't you worry
[11:23] have you asked Farheen?
[11:28] don't worry about that
[11:30] let me speak to Noreen right away
[12:14] Did Arham let you come?
[12:17] why will he stop me?
[12:22] responsibilities are over, rights are over
[12:32] I wish, I would do something for you Sanaya
[12:37] I just need your prayers mom
[12:43] And don't worry a lot about me. I have compromised
[12:56] everything happens in a compromise
[13:01] a house responsibility, kids... a husband's support
[13:10] but a husband's love & care is not there
[13:19] his emotions are not there
[13:21] this is a compromise
[13:28] since I got to know about Fabiha
[13:31] I have started feeling very upset
[13:36] when I have already explained my heart, then why are you taking so long to explain it to your heart?
[13:46] don't think too much, don't get worried a lot
[13:54] you get sick while thinking a lot about me, & then brother Junaid gets worried
[14:01] did Junaid said something to you?
[14:04] No mom, he haven't said anything
[14:10] but being a sister, I can understand her worries
[14:15] See, if he says anything to you then let me know. I will fix him right away
[14:22] No, he haven't said anything mom
[14:30] just don't think too much for me
[14:32] okay my dear, I love you!
[14:36] the truth is that.. 
[14:39] brother Junaid & I don't want to loose you
[15:42] Farheen
[15:44] yes tell me
[15:46] ok tell me, what have you mind?
[15:50] nothing
[15:53] then what happened, why are you ignoring me?
[15:56] when am I ignoring?
[15:58] Hamza, you know if I get late for ten minutes then several work gets pending on my head
[16:59] hello!
[17:01] who is this speaking?
[17:07] have you stopped recognizing my voice too?
[17:17] See, don't waste your time by calling here again & again
[17:24] I told you that you are dead for me, so that's it!
[17:29] If I have died, then why have you still hung my picture in your house?
[17:33] why my bag is still hanging inside the room?
[17:39] Why are you putting both of us in torment by keeping me away from you?
[17:43] I don't want to talk to you, disconnect the call
[17:47] but mom listen. Hello?
[19:00] hello!
[19:02] you've picked up the phone on the first bell today, all good?
[19:06] yes, because the phone was in my hand as I was talking to my mom
[19:09] So what did you guys talk about? Has her anger cooled a bit?
[19:12] absolutely not!
[19:17] I know her very well, she won't agree so easily
[19:21] leave these matters, stay ready today we'll go on a dinner
[19:26] is there anything special today?
[19:28] Every moment when we are together and no one is between us is special for us
[19:34] oh really!
[19:36] you can test it
[19:38] Okay, let me try
[19:41] be ready
[19:43] Okay, I'll see you
[19:45] Bye!
[19:47] bye!
[20:08] I am thinking to make Biryani (rice) & Spaghetti
[20:11] The kids will eat it as well, and you like it too
[20:14] Okay
[20:16] by the way, what's your plan for today?
[20:18] what do you mean?
[20:21] tomorrow is your Anniversary Sanaya, have you forgotten?
[20:32] When the relationship that used to bring happiness no longer exists, then what's the point of celebrating an anniversary?
[20:43] this is a chance to bring back brother Arham towards you
[20:50] When you've entered this battle, then hope to achieve victory.
[20:57] sister, Arham is not in a mood to listen to anything right now
[21:04] And the situation in the house is especially affecting Hadi
[21:12] I don't understand what to do
[21:14] Hadi is being expelled from the school
[21:18] yes, Junaid had told me
[21:24] Even Hadi's antics are becoming unbearable
[21:30] men never understands
[21:32] in order to hide their mistakes, they point of hundred mistakes of a woman
[21:47] By the way, the children for whom you made so many sacrifices..
[21:55] today their future is on the stake
[22:01] everything is happening because of Arham 
[22:07] He is a sinner to my children, just as he is to me
[22:22] anyways leave it, lets do the preparations
[22:29] fix your mood, everything will be fine
[22:42] will you help me in cutting the tomatoes?
[22:44] yes
[24:32] Farheen, come sit in the car. Let me drop you
[24:37] No its ok Hamza, I will go home by bus. You may go
[24:41] What is this childish attitude, Farheen? Don't be stubborn and get in the car. You got out of the car this morning as well
[24:46] Hamza, please
[24:50] don't create a drama on the road, I am telling you that I will go by bus
[24:55] Farheen please, listen..
my bus is here
[24:58] but Farheen, listen...
Farheen, wait
[25:40] Farheen haven't come as of yet
[25:44] greetings mom!
[25:45] Greetings! You took so long to come back today
[25:48] Yes, actually, I got a bus very late
[25:51] bus?
[25:52] but you had gone with Hamza, so why bus on your way back?
[25:57] Mom, today on wards I will manage my commute myself
[26:01] its good, this way we'll be saved from Hamza's favors on us
[26:09] Oh yes, Shamim visited today with a proposal
[26:17] its a good proposal, the guy is also good. Even the family isn't too big
[26:25] I have asked her to come tomorrow to see you
[26:29] do come early from your office
[26:32] God!
[26:34] what's wrong with you, how can you make such a big decision yourself?
[26:38] so, why I would have asked you?
[26:40] one day or the other, you have to get married
[26:43] Mom, I don't want to get married at all
[26:47] as it is, I know Shamim aunty
[26:49] The proposal she brought must be for a guy who is definitely a father of two kids
[26:53] really!
[26:54] As if you would get a proposal from a bachelor, furthermore, you are a divorced woman
[27:04] Whatever decision I have made, only that will be done
[27:11] See, I am your mother not an enemy
[27:14] even Hania will be married now
[27:18] Are you asking me to climb the gallows because of Hania?
[27:21] its not that matter!
[27:26] every girl makes her family after getting married
[27:29] also you won't be getting a proposal from some king or prince
[27:35] You've started to get old. Have you ever looked in the mirror?
[27:39] Mom, however I am, I am happy. You don't have to worry about me
[27:43] how can I not worry?
[27:45] Will I sit here for my entire life to take care of you?
[27:50] everyone has to leave this world one day or the other
[27:53] But we don't stop living because we are afraid of death
[27:59] Please, I beg you. Remove the thought of my marriage from your heart. I don't want to get married or anything
[28:08] Fine! You have always done everything as per your consent
[28:15] first, you had been crying for that Haris
[28:18] when he divorced you then you saw your mother
[28:25] now you'll only do as I will ask you to do, that's it!
[28:28] I won't agree with you, mom
[28:30] Whatever you are getting, think of it as a blessing
[28:37] Quietly get married and start your own family. Until when will you keep knocking on your mother's door?
[28:45] this society won't let you live in peace
[28:48] mom, don't you feel a little mercy on me?
[28:51] I am feeling mercy, that's why I am thinking good for you
[28:54] enough of your good thinking for me, now let me be
[29:02] we can spend our life without a man as well, I don't want to get married
[29:06] you have to get married, & that's my final decision!
[29:39] what if mom gets me married forcefully, then?
[29:45] I just saw some life
[29:48] how can I follow the path which is completely strange for me?
[29:54] I have to do something, Farheen
[29:56] but what shall I do?
[29:59] what shall I do if Hamza couldn't understand my feelings
[30:34] Arham, what are you doing?
[30:37] Nothing, just come with me quietly & no questions
[30:41] but Arham...
[30:41] hey trust me
[30:42] Arham, I can't see anything. Remove your hand, Arham!
[30:46] ok, remove your hand
[30:48] two, three... ta da...
[30:52] is this all for me?
[30:54] This is evident for my wife's happiness
[30:58] Happy Anniversary!
[30:59] Happy Anniversary, Arham
[31:01] thank you so much!
cut the cake
[31:06] oh!
[31:08] thank you so much, Arham
[31:11] I'm sorry, I forgot to get the flowers
[31:12] I will never forget you
[31:14] I will take the revenge on the day of judgement
[31:18] I am joking..
[31:20] our love doesn't need the support of flowers, Arham
[31:25] If you ever feel that the love between us is diminishing then...
[31:30] Freshen our love by giving just one flower
[31:33] not just one, I will bring the entire bouquet
[31:36] now eat the cake
[31:39] check your gift
[32:53] Hadi, what are you doing? how many times I've told you to write on the line
[32:58] but you aren't listening to me
[33:00] you never used to do this way, so what's the issue now?
[33:02] don't you want to do top this time?
[33:04] I want to
[33:05] alright then, remove this & write it again
[33:11] Hareem, what happened my dear? Why are you crying, what's the matter?
[33:17] Fabiha aunty has moved all the stuff from our room
[33:22] what?
[33:23] She also told me that, from today onwards, it's not our room anymore. I want my room
[33:28] my dear, nobody will take your room from you. Your mom is with you
[33:32] I will talk to Fabiha aunty once your dad is back home, Ok?
[33:34] don't cry...
please come with me
[33:35] Hareem, listen to me my dear. What's wrong? Don't cry a lot. Everything will be fine
[33:42] Fabiha aunty will take everything away from us, Mom!
[33:45] my dear, no body will take away anything from you. Trust me!
[33:49] mom is here, your mom will talk to your dad once he comes back home. Ok?
[33:55] you are your mother's brave daughter
[33:57] ok tell me, would you like to have an ice-cream?
[33:59] I don't want to eat an ice-cream
[34:01] Okay, if not ice cream then pop corn?
[34:04] I don't want to eat anything
[34:40] mom, did you call me?
[34:42] yes, sit
[34:44] I want to talk to you
[34:49] Tell me, who allowed you to become a wall between me & Sanaya?
[34:57] what's wrong with you? What as such I have done?
[34:59] The same way I am your mother, I am Sanaya's mother too
[35:03] and children grief is same
[35:08] But you left her alone in this situation
[35:14] you have proved to be so selfish!
[35:19] you had gone to her house, right?
[35:22] you said to her, not to share any of her house related matter with me
[35:29] mom I...
[35:30] Did you say it or not?
[35:33] listen to me, I...
[35:34] did you go or not?
yes or no?
[35:37] yes, I had gone
[35:39] And I had forbidden her to not share with you, so that you wouldn't fall sick
[35:44] just because of it
[35:46] she considers you as her father
[35:53] And you left her alone? You wanted to distance her from her blood relations?
[36:01] We should stand by her during such circumstances
[36:08] you haven't done good with her, she honors you!
[36:15] she respects you!
[36:18] She wants your betterment. She obeys each and every word of yours as the final verdict
[36:24] and what you did with her?
[36:29] Look into yourself and see what you did to my daughter. You left her completely alone.
[36:35] Mom, the same way she is dear to you, she is dear to me
[36:43] My intention was just that you should not fall sick, that's why I told her not to discuss her issues with you
[36:51] a person who is upset, he cries about it
[36:56] won't he discuss it with his mother?
[36:58] There is a beggar who goes door to door saying, 'This is my problem. I want this.'
[37:03] can't he discuss this with his mother & siblings?
[37:13] mom look...
[37:14] go away from here! I don't want to see your face. Go away!
[37:19] mom, listen to me
[37:21] go away!
[37:23] go!
[38:06] Whose permission did you take to take these pictures?
[38:18] from Arham's, whose else?
[38:22] did Arham asked you to remove these pictures?
[38:26] You may think that way, but if I don't like them, why would he like them?
[38:34] And when your presence is no longer in this house, what will we do with your pictures and memories here?
[38:42] eventually I have to throw them off
[38:44] so I thought of burying all the things
[38:51] Your pictures will be inside the store, and you will be sent to your parents' house
[38:55] Also, did you remove the children's stuff from their room at Arham's orders?
[38:59] So, has your dearest daughter complained to you?
[39:05] don't bring the children in between, Fabiha
[39:11] my children are already very disturbed, so don't test my patience
[39:26] When Arham has removed you from his heart, what will you do by staying in this house?
[39:33] Even if you want to, I still won't let you stay here
[39:37] I won't be afraid of your threats
[39:44] I have an equal right to this house, as much as you do
[39:50] And nobody can take my right away from me. Understand? Neither you nor Arham
