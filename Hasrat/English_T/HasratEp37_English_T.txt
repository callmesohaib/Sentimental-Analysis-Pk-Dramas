[01:11] Sanaya is right deciding that she is going back home. 
 Only God knows whether this is a right decision or wrong.
[01:19] But as a mother, I'll pray for her to be happy. But..
[01:26] Living with her husband's second wife will be difficult for her. 
 Mom, I think Sanaya won't be able to stay there for long.
[01:36] You keep talking nonsense. Think before you speak. 
 I'm right Junaid.
[01:42] That girl won't let her stay there for long.
[01:49] I thought she was only clever but her tongue.. God spare us.
[01:56] I realize this Soumya.
[02:00] Sanaya isn't a child. If she decided to go there, she must have thought things through.
[02:06] She must have strengthened herself to tackle things there. 
 I pray to God that whatever purpose she has gone back for..
[02:14] May God make her successful. 
 Amen..
[02:18] You're right.
[02:25] Here, this one. No.. Try this one.
[02:33] No. Not this one either. 
 Hadi, go to your room.
[02:37] You have to do your homework. 
 Mom please, let me play with Fabiha aunty.. 
[02:40] First we'll do our homework and then we'll play. Come on. Lets go. I'm coming.
[02:49] How many times have I told you to stay away from my kids?
[02:53] They're kids. They love me. They come to me themselves. 
 If you scold them once, they'll not come back.
[02:59] I cannot break their heart. 
 Of course. You join hearts with other people's husbands.
[03:06] Throw this out of your mind. You cannot throw me out of Arham's life.
[03:13] I didn't marry Arham to kick you out of his life. I've never wanted this.
[03:21] Can we forget everything and live together here? If you compromise. 
 Compromise?
[03:31] Not at all.
[03:36] What do you think? You'll destroy everything and I'll compromise quietly?
[03:45] Don't even think about it.
[03:52] I made this house with love and your greed destroyed it.
[04:01] Whether I get Arham or not but I won't let stay in Arham's life for long. I promise.
[04:08] I don't want to fight. 
 You started this fight but I'll end it.
[04:22] You came in this house without permission, but remember this is my house.
[04:33] Understand?
[04:44] Come!
[04:52] I want her to remember that this is my house. Go. Your husband is calling you.
[05:08] And let me remind you that this is not only your house. Its mine as well. You should remember that too.
[05:29] Come Fabiha.
[07:06] Here mom.. food is here.
[07:12] Mom.. 
 Yes?
[07:13] What happened? What are you thinking? 
 Nothing.
[07:18] There is something mom. Tell me. 
 I was thinking.
[07:23] I should find a girl and get Hamza married.
[07:29] What are you saying? 
 Why? Whats wrong in it?
[07:35] Whoever girl comes in his life will be proud of him.
[07:42] Fabiha has destroyed her life with her own hands.
[07:49] She never deserved Hamza.
[07:54] I don't think Hamza will be ready to get married at any cost.
[08:01] I'll make him agree and he'll never turn me down.
[08:11] Alright. Start eating now. 
 Okay. You too.
[08:54] I've just thrown you out of the room right now. Very soon you'll leave the house too.
[09:04] And then from Arham's life as well. And I won't do it. Sanaya will.
[09:15] You must have realized her power. 
 If I'm quiet, this doesn't mean I'm scared.
[09:23] I know how to claim my right very well. 
 What will you do alone, Fabiha?
[09:31] You only had Arham's support in this house and you'll lose him too. 
 I don't want to plot and plan, Hadia.
[09:40] But if I'm forced.. I'll throw you out first. Its best if you consider yourself a guest in this house.
[09:49] Guests come for a few days. Wives stay for a lifetime. Don't force me. 
 Fabiha!
[09:57] Its best if you leave. If the argument extends, you'll be the bad guys in your brother's eyes. 
 It won't be me. It'll be you and that too very soon.
[10:42] My dear, please take your soup. Your aunt made it for you with so much love. Hurry up.
[10:50] What happened Hadi? Why aren't you eating? Should I help you? 
 No dad. I'll do it myself.
[10:58] Then eat. 
 Good girl.
[11:04] How is it, Hareem?
[11:09] Come on dear. We'll eat in our room. 
 Why mom? Why can't we eat here?
[11:14] What happened Sanaya? Where are you going? 
 Either she or I will sit on this table. Come dear. 
[11:20] Let it be. I'll leave. You sit down.
[11:33] Hurry up and finish it. Very good.
[11:39] Come on Hadi..
[11:51] Start.. 
 Sanaya.. you did good. You reminded Fabiha of what she's worth.
[12:00] And another thing.. you don't have to be afraid of Arham or anybody else. I'm with you.
[13:20] Eat something. 
 I'm not hungry, Arham.
[13:26] I'm sorry on behalf of Sanaya. Give Sanaya some time. Everything is new for her. She'll take time to accept it.
[13:37] Everything will be alright. She'll be used to it. Everything will be okay. 
 She won't get used to anything, Arham.
[13:47] Fabiha, why don't you think that you took her place? How would she feel? You do know the feeling if someone takes your place.
[14:01] Life isn't easy. We make it easy by compromising, by being patient and by ignoring.
[14:16] And you'll have to make use of all these to make your life better.
[14:31] What happened? What are you thinking? 
 I understand but Sanaya mam is only listening to what Hadia is saying.
[14:41] What do you mean? 
 Arham, I heard Hadia saying that she'll help Sanaya mam to throw me out.
[14:52] No. It cannot be. 
 It is so. And you know very well how she did this with Sanaya.
[15:01] If Hadia goes back to Dubai, problems in the house will be solved. I know she's your sister but..
[15:11] You'll have to be firm for your house.
[15:28] Alright. I'll see to it. You eat.
[16:34] You cannot come inside or sleep here. 
[16:51] Sanaya, you're forgetting that its my room as well. 
 It might be but from today its only mine.
[16:59] You might be used to sharing your things with someone but I cannot share my things with anyone. 
[17:06] I'm not just anyone. I'm your husband. 
 You were. But now you're only my childrens' father.
[17:17] And I don't want you to feel that if we're together, everything will be alright.
[17:26] We're in the same house, Arham but not together.
[17:34] And I don't want to be the bad guy in front of the world. Its best if you leave.
[17:40] But Sanaya... 
 Please Arham. Are you leaving or should I?
[17:56] And shut the door before you leave and knock before you come in my room.
[19:27] Arham, why are you standing here?
[19:35] What happened?
[19:44] Arham? 
[20:19] Sanaya mam shouldn't have thrown you out of your room. This is an insult. How can she throw you? You got married and its not a sin.
[20:33] And how can the years of love change into hatred in one night?
[20:40] Fabiha, when your heart breaks, even a few days seem like centuries.
[20:52] I've broken Sanaya's heart and there can be no patch that can mend it.
[21:02] What do you think what love is?
[21:08] Love is just a word. Only a word.
[21:14] But in reality, love is all those moments that two people spend together.
[21:23] They see the good and bad in life together. And today, the same moments,
[21:32] have become hateful memories for Sanaya. We're living under the same roof but we aren't together.
[21:41] What more can be a bigger punishment? 
 Arham loves means realization, compromise, patience and ignorance. We need all these to keep a relationship alive.
[21:54] And only the person you cannot live without is important in love. If you convince yourself to live alone, you should understand it wasn't a compromise in love.
[22:08] It was a compromise with fate. 
 You want to say that Sanaya doesn't love me?
[22:17] Arham, there is love in relationship and then there is love in your soul.
[22:25] There are hundreds of women in this world who are tolerating another women for the sake of love and Sanaya mam is a part of this world.
[22:40] If she thinks this love is important, me being here shouldn't bother her.
[23:04] Good boy. Come down. Mom will come and give you breakfast. Be careful.
[23:15] Where is my phone?
[23:26] I'm here to get my clothes for office. 
 I've kept them in your room.
[23:32] If you feel you can ask your so-called wife to get your clothes so you won't have a problem.
[23:43] Excuse me. I'm getting late for work.
[24:04] Is my breakfast ready? 
 Of course. Go and sit on the table, I'll just bring it.
[24:23] Here is your sandwich. Finish it fast.
[24:35] Hadi? Mom will make a sandwich for you. 
 Mom, I eat the sandwich that Fabiha aunty makes.
[24:46] Mom told you.. I'll make one for you. Okay?
[25:05] You're wrong. Why are you venting out on Hadi?
[25:13] You're the child in this house. Not them. Am I speaking Persian? Don't you understand?
[25:20] How many times have I told you to stay away from my kids? You cannot attract them to you by doing things for them.
[25:32] You've snatched my husband. I'll not let you snatch my children. 
 I understand everything.
[25:40] But you're not understanding anything. You're proving yourself as a tyrant to Arham even when you're suffering.
[25:48] When you do all this, you're displaying yourself as the bad guy. You're driving away Arham. Do you know that?
[25:58] Oh well. I really wanted to live together. But since you're not in the mood, why should I be stupid and give you whats mine.
[26:07] You're happy staying away from Arham and I'm happy with him. 
 Stupid girls like you think the same.
[26:19] You think if you trim a piegon's feathers, he'll forget to fly.
[26:28] He'll stay in your cage for a few days but as soon as he gets a chance, he'll deceive you and fly away.
[26:41] A man is the same. As soon as he gets a chance, he'll go astray. Its his nature.
[26:55] And what is it for a man? He couldn't be mine. How can he be yours?
[27:04] But you should trim his feathers carefully.. Your pigeon might fly away too soon.
[27:17] Fabiha? Fabiha? Where is my tie?
[27:26] I'll come and give it to you myself. Come. 
[27:52] Mom, my sandwich? 
 I'm bringing it dear. Just a moment.
[28:07] Hadi? Hadi? What happened? Tell me why are you crying? 
 Hadi?
[28:16] Where is my son? Hadi? Where is my dear? I think my son is upset with me.
[28:28] Mom, what happened to Hadi? Is he upset? 
 He's very upset.
[28:36] I don't want to eat the sandwich you made. I want the one Fabiha aunty made. 
 My dear..
[28:42] Mom always made your sandwich... 
 I don't want it.
[28:45] Hadi.. stop. Eat it..
[28:50] Its okay dear. You pack your bag.
[29:12] Hamza? You here? So early?
[29:16] You should be at work. 
 Yes. I was passing by so I thought I'd pick you. You'll have to travel by bus otherwise.
[29:24] But I'm not even ready yet and I have to give breakfast to mom.
[29:29] So its alright. I'll wait for a while. You can get ready.
[29:34] Alright. Give me ten minutes. You sit inside. I'll go and get ready.
[31:23] Hamza? 
 Hello.
[31:26] Hello. How come you're here?
[31:30] I was passing by for work, I thought I'd pick Farheen up.
[31:35] She'll save the fare and she won't get bothered in the bus.
[31:42] Mom, I've set your breakfast. Hamza and I will leave for work now.
[31:50] Alright. Bye. 
 Bye dear.
[32:13] Have the kids gone to school? 
 They're in their room.
[32:16] When are you going back? 
 Why brother?
[32:21] Am I burden on you? 
 Its not that. I'm just asking.
[32:26] I don't want to have breakfast. I don't want to have breakfast. 
 Hadi, listen to me.  
[32:42] What happened Sanaya? 
 He's upset.
[33:26] I'm very upset. I'll not talk to anyone. Its enough.
[33:37] Dad, why are you so angry right now?
[33:44] First you tell me why are you angry? 
 Dad, Fabiha aunty made a sandwich for me but mom took it away.
[33:52] And she said I shouldn't eat it. Why is mom so angry? She isn't letting me play with Fabiha aunty?
[34:02] Actually.. your breakfast was late Hadi.. thats why.
[34:09] I'll ask fabiha aunty to make your breakfast on time. Then mom won't be angry. Now have breakfast. Your van will come. You have to go to school.
[34:18] Dad, you tell me, why were you angry? 
 Oh yes.. But you calmed down.
[34:25] Dad also calmed down. Now come and have breakfast. Good boy.
[34:31] Come on..
[34:46] What are you doing? 
 Oh I'm helping you. What else? Didn't you hear what your brother said?
[34:55] Right now I'm not going anywhere. 
 Hadia, you'll have to leave.
[35:03] Now it depends upon you how you'll leave. With respect or after an insult.
[35:11] This is my mother's house. 
 So she's gone? She won't come back. And what will you do waiting. Tell me.
[35:24] I told you to not take my silence as my weakness. I don't want your brother to drag you to the airport forcibly.
[35:34] So its best if you leave with respect. And yes..
[35:38] Pack everything once and for all. You don't know if you're coming back ever.
[35:45] So pack well? Alright?
[35:53] Here...
[36:36] Hello mom. 
 Hello. How are you dear?
[36:41] My happiness is upset with me mom. I don't know how I'll travel this journey.
[36:48] Sanaya.. you will travel and this journey will end.
[36:53] You just have to be courageous and patient to reach your destination. 
 Thats what I cannot see, mom.
[37:04] Dear, we don't anything get more than our fate and before time. And whatever you have..
[37:13] Try and find your happiness in that. You should try. 
 I try my best to forgive Arham.
[37:23] But whenever I think about forgiving Arham, my self respect makes me selfish, mom.
[37:31] I'm here only for my kids. My relationship with Arham is over since long. 
 Try and give your relationship another chance, dear.
[37:44] I'm your mother. I'll never think bad for you. A husband is the only protector of his wife.
[37:53] Otherwise, this selfish world will eat you away. Understand what I'm saying.
[38:02] I've asked the van driver to drop the kids to you. Call me as soon as they're home.
[38:13] I'll talk to you later. Bye..
