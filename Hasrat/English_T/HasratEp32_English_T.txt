[00:13] Your love and sympathy is all for show.
[00:18] What do you think...
[00:21] Did you think I didn't understand it?
[00:27] And auntie, I didn't do all of this.
[00:31] You did this.
He's here to take me away...
[00:36] Ask him.... Arhum you're lying, right?
Let him go...
[00:48] I married my sister to you with honor.
[00:51] I didn't sell her to you to do anything you want.
Get away uncle!
[00:57] He's my father, you cannot touch him!
[02:14] Mother...
[02:19] Will you leave us like father?
[02:23] No... no my dear. How can I leave you?
[02:28] No... I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.
[02:37] Your mother is not going anywhere.
[02:46] I'm right here with you. Don't be afraid.
[03:16] Being worried won't solve your problems Arhum.
[03:19] I don't care about my problems. I'm concerned about my daughter. She should be playing at her age...
[03:26] not going through what she is... this is not good for my kids.
[03:31] As a father, it's my duty to protect my kids.
[03:37] And I think that it's necessary for my kids to be here.
[03:49] If you want, can I talk to Sanaya?
[03:54] There is no point in you talking to her. She's furious...
[04:00] and I don't want her to make a drastic decision.
[04:05] I think that you should talk to Sanaya alone.
[04:08] Not in front of her family. That won't solve anything.
[04:14] That's not possible... where can I meet her? She doesn't pick up... there's no way.
[04:22] You can meet her at the office as well.
[04:25] I'm sure she'll be weary of her surroundings and talk to you.
[04:44] Shenaya... come and eat. You haven't eaten since morning.
[04:53] I'm no hungry...
[04:58] I have no intention to live.
[05:01] You'll have to eat to live.
[05:05] If not for yourself, then for your kids.
The life you see in me...
[05:12] is because of my kids.
[05:16] You're going through a bad period, it will pass.
[05:21] Sometimes bad periods end everything.
[05:27] Everything is over before it even began...
[05:33] I'm your mother my dear... I'm living because of you.
[05:39] If you lose hope then how will I live?
[05:43] I'm shattered mother.
[05:49] Arhum has taken away my right to live.
[05:54] Everything is over.
[05:56] My dear... don't worry...
[06:30] Did you talk to the estate agent about the house for rent?
[06:36] Alright, ready the agreement tomorrow. We'll finalize it tomorrow. I'll see you on my way home from work
[07:14] No.
[07:17] No...
[07:20] Fabiha... no... no...
[07:25] Hareem!
[07:53] Hareem!
[07:59] Hareem is not here.
[08:47] Mother.
[08:50] Come have breakfast, after that I'll give you your medicine.
Did Shenaya eat... when I went to her room, she was readying Hadi.
[08:57] She said that she would eat... I'm sure she hasn't.
[09:02] Mothers take care of everyone, but who takes care of mothers. How can a mother eat when her children haven't.
[09:07] Mother... Shenaya ate...
[09:11] I was hard for her, but she did. Now please have breakfast, so that I may give you medicine.
[09:17] Is that the truth?
[09:21] Yes mother, why would I lie to you?
[09:25] Now have breakfast, so that I may give you medicine.
Alright fine...
[09:30] Shenaya didn't eat anything last night as well. I don't know why she chooses to live in pain.
[09:37] Mother, she has to live with that pain for the rest of her life... the wounds that brother Arhum gave her won't heal so easily.
[09:47] You're right... a wound a man gives a woman, make her hollow inside.
[09:53] Then only a desire for love is left inside.
But when a woman decides...
[09:59] then she become very strong.
You're right.
[10:04] I just want her to salvage her life and not be ruined.
[10:11] I cannot face Shenaya's problems for her...
[10:17] Mother... but you can pray...
[10:22] Pray for her all the time, so that you may find peace and so does Shenaya...
[10:29] Let's have breakfast.
Come on.
[10:32] My God... let's go.
[11:01] Auntie get up I've brought you breakfast.
[11:04] I'll wash your face, then you can have breakfast.
[11:07] Alright?
[11:12] I don't want to eat.
[11:15] Go away.
[11:19] Why are you being stubborn? You'll get sick.
[11:24] Please don't take out your anger on the food.
[11:43] I'm keeping it here, be sure to have it.
[12:18] God please bless my daughter's fate.
[12:23] My Lord, protect my daughter and her children.
[12:27] Shelter her from the slightest pain. 
[12:32] Create softness in Arhum's heart. 
[12:40] You listen to all prayers... please listen to mine as well.
[12:47] I ask you for this... I dare not ask it of anyone.
[12:53] You know the matter of the heart. Please bless my daughter with happiness.
[13:01] Amen... Amen...
[13:05] Bless us.
[13:22] Let's hurry up...
[13:26] Mother... you've put the tie on backwards...
[13:30] Sorry my dear... sorry...
[13:34] Hareem... hurry up...
[13:37] Mother... sister Hareem is not here.
[13:42] With father.
[13:48] Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget. We're running late.
[13:54] Let's go... good boy...
[13:59] Let's go.
[14:03] Auntie Fabiha...
No auntie Fabiha... from now on you'll call me little mother...
[14:09] Little mother?
But my mother is at granny's house.
[14:13] That's is true... but she's your elder mother, whereas I'm your little mother.
[14:19] Little mother? But one can only have one mother.
[14:24] When you love someone so much...
[14:29] And when you like someone... you like me, right?
Yes.
[14:33] Then you take care of what they like and dislike. And I would like it if you call me little mother.
[14:40] Alright... then from now on I'll call you little mother...
Promise?
[14:45] Promise...
Then let's get ready, where are your shoes?
[14:52] Here's your water bottle and here's you school bag, lets' go.
[14:59] There are a few things missing in aisle number fourteen...
[15:05] Hamza...
[15:10] You didn't come into work for the past few days.
I wasn't feeling well.
[15:17] Mother was worried for you... she thinks of you like her son
[15:21] There is a difference between thinking and actually being. Ask her to be concerned about her daughter.
[15:29] What should she show concern for? She hasn't returned since that day.
[15:33] We don't where she is and how she's doing.
[15:37] We've asked friends and neighbors, but we learned nothing.
[15:42] I have said a prayer in Fabiha's name.
[15:46] Forget about this..
[15:49] I talked to my boss about you. Send your details into HR tomorrow, God willing things will work out.
[15:58] No... there is no need for that. I've sold the house.
[16:03] I don't need it anymore. I'll return the loan tomorrow. Thanks anyways.
[16:38] Who lives in your home?
My sister and mother.
[16:45] Wow... you're lucky that you have your sister, I have no one.
[16:50] Then make me your sister... a good friend.
[16:53] Really?
Yes.
[16:56] Here is your apple juice.
Muskan!
[17:00] Don't you dare take anything from her.
It's just apple juice...
[17:06] Why are you being angry at Muskan?
She's my daughter and I'll do as I please.
[17:12] There's no trusting you, you could add poison to this.
Why would I do that? Are you insane?
[17:20] Mother... auntie Fabiha made it in front of me.
[17:24] Silence! Can't you see we're talking. I don't want to see you near her!
[18:03] Hareem!
[18:06] Mother!
[18:10] My child... are you okay my dear?
Yes...
[18:22] Let's sit here...
[18:27] Show me... how are you?
[18:31] Show me...
What are you looking at?
[18:37] Did auntie Fabiha say something to you? Did she scold you or hit you?
[18:42] No... little mother is very good. She takes care of me.
[18:50] Little mother?
[18:54] Who told you this? Auntie Fabiha...
[18:57] She asked me to call her that from now on.
[19:00] She's my mother as well.
No
[19:04] I'm your only mother.
You are my elder mother.
[19:13] Does father know about this?
[19:15] Yes, father knows... and she lives with us as well.
[19:23] My dear child... don't share this with anyone
[19:29] Not with your friends or your teachers... promise?
Promise.
[19:35] Good girl.
[19:39] Mother...
[19:42] When will you return home?
[19:49] I don't know child...
[19:55] You're upset with me, right?
[19:58] No my dear... how can I be upset with my child?
[20:07] Is it because I went with father?
[20:15] I thought that Hadi was with you...
[20:20] That's why I decided to go with father, because he's alone.
[20:28] Don't you have a class to go to? You'll be late.
[20:32] I'll come back to meet you later...
[21:09] What did Hareem say to you?
[21:12] She told Hareem that she's her little mother and I'm her elder mother.
[21:16] I cannot leave my daughter with a step mother.
[21:20] She stole everything from me. My house... my husband.
[21:24] Before she steals my children from me...
[21:28] I have to bring Hareem back.
[21:37] If I see you near her again..
[21:40] What happened... why are you scolding her?
Make her understand mother...
[21:45] She's with Fabiha everyday. She'll turn my daughter against me.
[21:50] Enough... nothing like that will happen.
[21:53] Why won't it? She was giving her apple juice.
[21:58] What if she adds something to it?
My God you're becoming just as superstitious as your in-laws.
[22:04] Think whatever you want. She's my only child and I wont risk her.
[22:09] Alright fine, enough! Don't scare her...
[22:14] I'll scold your mother... go play with your sister.
[22:19] Enough... come sit here.
[22:22] What's the matter with you mother?
Tell me.
[22:25] What will we do with Fabiha? Have you planned anything?
[22:32] You'll leave in a few days, then what will happen to me?
[22:39] I've lost my daughter-in-law and my caretaker.
[22:43] That girl...
[22:46] who used to come here, bathe me and dress me up...
[22:58] Do you know what she told me?
[23:03] She told me that she doesn't care...
[23:07] if I have tea or not... she doesn't care that I take my insulin...
[23:13] or not...
[23:21] What will happen to me?
[23:27] What did I do?
[23:35] Mother.
[23:37] Fabiha is confident because she knows that sister Shenaya has no value in this house.
[23:44] If you and I work together to bring sister Shenaya back...
[23:49] only then we can defeat Fabiha...
[23:54] Besides...
[23:56] Sister Shenaya is mother to my brother's children
[24:01] She is strong that way.
[24:07] If she comes back.
[24:10] Only then will Fabiha know her actual worth.
[24:14] I'll enjoy watching Fabiha squirm.
[24:43] What's the matter Fabiha?
[24:46] What happened?
[24:51] Auntie didn't take her insulin. I also know that she won't have breakfast as well, please talk to her before you leave.
[24:58] I don't want her to get sick.
[25:02] Don't worry... my mother is a little strict. It will take her a little time.
[25:07] I know how she is Arhum.
[25:14] Her anger is justified, I'm not worried about her anger.
[25:18] I'm worried that she might harm herself because of her anger.
[25:24] I'll talk to her... she'll listen. Don't worry.
[25:30] Come home early today.
[25:33] Alright... I have a meeting, but I will try.
[25:37] Alright... Hareem's van guy said that he won't be picking her up on his way back. Please pick her up.
[25:43] Don't worry, I will.
Alright.
[26:22] Shenaya, didn't you go to work today?
[26:25] I'll go in late.
[26:28] If you're going to work late, then where are you coming from now?
[26:34] I went to school to meet Hareem.
And did you meet her?
[26:50] If you just met your daughter then why aren't you relieved? Why are you worried?
[27:00] Hareem's childhood is lost.
[27:03] She is hearing things that she shouldn't. Fabiha is saying thing that she ought not say to her.
[27:10] What did Hareem tell you?
She told her that she's her little mother and I'm her elder mother.
[27:18] I cannot leave my daughter with a step mother. She has taken everything away from me, my husband... my house...
[27:26] Before she takes my children from me, I'll have to bring Hareem back here.
[27:33] I know how hard this time is for a woman. A time where her husband chooses another woman over her.
[27:42] No woman likes to see her place being taken away by another woman.
[27:46] But... there are many women in the world who tolerate this...
[27:51] And they are tolerating.
What do you want me to do mother?
[27:55] Should I become like the rest?
[27:59] Should I tolerate my husband's cruelty out of fear of  my in-laws?
[28:07] Why? Because he's a man?
[28:12] He can do everything...
[28:16] Men will always remember their right of marrying for women as per Islam. But they always forget to provide the rights of women.
[28:23] When a woman can work to maintain his home...
[28:27] When she can cook... when she can take care of his kids...
[28:30] when she can take care of his parents... then why does a man forget her loyalty...
[28:34] and pursues marriage to different women. What more could I have done to gain Arhum's loyalty?
[28:44] My dear, women have always been the ones to sacrifice.
[28:50] She sacrifices for her husband... she sacrifices for her kids...
[28:55] All she does is sacrifice.
But I won't do that mother.
[29:02] I will raise a voice for my right. I will set an example for all women.
[29:10] I have fulfilled all my duties. I don't fear anyone. I just want my daughter back.
[29:18] What do you want to do? I just want my kids to be with my mother.
[29:25] First make a decision about your life. What do you want?
[29:30] That is more important.
Right now I want to stay alone with my children.
[29:37] Do you want the kids to be divided between their mother and father?
[29:43] If men think about this before marrying then most men would not marry for the second time.
[29:50] It takes two to dance.
[29:53] If men are wrong, then so are women. Both have an equal blame in it.
[29:58] For a man it is important for his woman to be loyal, which I was with Arhum.
[30:05] I didn't make a mistake in fulfilling my duties, if I had...
[30:13] I would have tolerated Arhum's disloyalty silently.
[30:19] I'm no wrong...
[30:22] That's why I have decided.
[30:24] What have you decided Shenaya?
[30:48] You still haven't had breakfast.
[30:53] Why?
[30:57] Hadia is making it for me. Don't worry.
[31:03] It's been so many days since you took your insulin.
[31:09] This cannot carry on.
[31:12] If you were so concerned about your mother.
[31:16] Then you should have listened to me on the first day.
[31:21] Fabiha used to take care of you before... she was the one who gave you insulin, then why are you reacting like this?
[31:30] When you are happy with someone who works for you, you praise them, not give them a share in the property.
[31:42] Everyone has their place...
[31:48] You should deal with them, keeping that in mind.
[31:53] You can be sympathetic with a beggar, or help him, but you won't bring him home.
[32:02] She shed a few tears and you were manipulated by her.
[32:08] I didn't think you were so were so foolish.
[32:11] I didn't expect you to be so foolish.
[32:26] What have you decided then? What's the solution for this?
[32:31] You might leave your wife, but you cannot stay away from your kids...
[32:35] I'm trying to convince Shenaya... and I will continue to do so until she agrees.
[32:43] She will only agree when you let her go
[32:48] Shenaya is upset... you are upset and you know that I don't have a choice.
[32:54] If you care about our happiness, then take her to her home.
[33:01] That won't happen.
[33:07] You know I won't do that.
[33:11] I am the one who should be punished...
[33:18] Stand by me please.
[33:25] Give Fabiha a chance.
[33:29] For  me.
[33:41] It is worrisome. Did you talk to her, or did she talk to you?
[33:48] No, did something happen?
[33:51] I'm so worried. She was about to make a decision.
[33:58] Don't worry... whatever she decides to do, she'll tell us...
[34:05] She has told me that she has decided.
[34:10] Alright fine... I'll talk to her... don't worry. I don't want you getting unwell.
[34:17] How can I not stress? She's my child, just like you are.
[34:22] She has children... why aren't they thinking about their children?
[34:27] Why are they punishing them?
[34:31] You know that one is helpless in front of their fate. I'll talk to her...
[34:39] And I'll try to stop her if she takes a bad decision. You trust me, right?
[34:44] My dear.... you're the only I can trust.
[34:48] Make your sister understand. Ask her to work on the matter...
[34:54] Ask her to reconsider.
Alright I'll say that to her.
[34:58] Don't worry please... don't stress..
[35:02] Alright? Did you take your medicine?
Yes I did... please talk to her.
[35:08] Alright... I will.
[35:24] Mother...
I'm dead to you and you're dead to me.
[35:28] Mother, don't say that. Listen to me... don't hang up.
[35:33] Don't try to call her again.
Mother, please listen to me.
[36:25] Junaid...
[36:28] What's the matter? You look worried... is everything okay?
[36:32] Everything is fine...
No.
[36:37] Your face doesn't say the same.
[36:41] I'm worried because of Shenaya.
[36:45] She's in a troubled situation.
[36:49] Yes she is...
[36:54] Mother is worried... she's asking me to ask Shenaya about her decision.
[37:00] Ask mother to no worry... I'll call Shenaya and talk to her.
[37:07] Do you think you should talk to her?
Yes, why not?
[37:11] I'll call her at night and ask her everything.
[37:17] Alright...
[37:19] Talk to her... tell me what she says.
[37:24] How was your day?
[37:27] It was fine...
[37:43] I trusted you.
[37:46] I trusted you with my kids and husband.
[37:52] But you didn't think once before betraying me. You betrayed my children, who you took care of!
[37:58] What would you have done it was me who had taken away your husband from you?
[38:07] I'm sure you would have been able to do nothing.
[38:13] I know that you must be happy ruining me.
[38:21] You will never have happiness as well.
I didn't want to ruin anyone.
[38:27] Could you find no one other than my husband?
It's easy to lead a lonely man astray.
[38:32] Your responsibilities left him alone.
And you took advantage of that.
[38:38] You didn't even think about taking a father away from his children.
[38:43] Don't you dare say the things that you saying to Hareem...
I might have tolerated you taking my husband...
[38:51] but for my kids I will never forgive you...
I don't want anything like that.
[38:57] Don't be proud of your luck, he's a man...
[39:01] he wasn't loyal to me... why would he be loyal to you?
Men are famous for their disloyalty..
[39:08] Forgive him... and come back home.
I will.
[39:14] But when you get out of our lives...
[39:18] Decide then...
It's not easy for a woman to sacrfice everything and then leave her husband.
[39:26] That's what I'm going through!
[39:31] You've hurt me...  and you will never be happy...
[39:39] Never.
