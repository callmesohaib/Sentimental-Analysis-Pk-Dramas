[03:03] I had expected that you'd be very angry as soon as you heard it.
[03:11] But I have to agree, you have a strong heart. You're still in this house.
[03:18] What did you tell my kids? 
 The truth. You'll be a step mom, soon.
[03:29] I was desperately waiting to give you this news.
[03:35] And I'll see how you get jealous of my importance in Arham's life.
[03:44] I can see that clearly right now.
[03:50] Do you know? Whenever I saw you with Arham and the kids, I would wish.. If only..
[03:57] I was in your place. And I didn't know when all my desires got fulfilled.
[04:11] What happened? Aren't you happy?
[04:16] To tell you the truth, this news is very shocking for me as well.
[04:22] I was just acting to be dizzy and I never thought that act would turn out to be so fruitful.
[04:32] People are right. Time waits for none.
[04:42] Today I have the chance to be proud about the family you had until yesterday. 
 
[04:48] You're absolutely right. Time waits for now.
[04:57] If its with you today, it will be with me tomorrow. But the way you're turning Arham against me.
[05:09] The day isn't far when you will lost this mask as well. 
 I haven't done anything yet.
[05:17] Such small wishes and such big pride?
[05:24] Don't do it.
[05:29] Do you know what it is? When you have someone to fulfill your desires, it gets fulfilled, whether big or small.
[05:42] And right now my biggest desire is to throw you out of Arham's life and this house.
[05:56] Are you challenging me? 
 Not at all.
[06:04] I'm warning you.
[06:11] Use as much oppression as you can handle in the future.
[06:17] Like a man belongs to none.. just like that..
[06:25] even time doesn't belong to anyone. 
 Don't say that Sanaya.
[06:30] If Arham scolded the kids, its because he's their father. What is my child's fault in it that you're cursing him?
[06:44] What? 
 Sanaya?
[06:46] Arham.. you'll not say anything to Sanaya's kid after today.
[06:55] I don't want to bring up my child amidst her curses.
[07:00] Sanaya I won't tolerate all this. You cannot curse my children.
[07:07] She's lying. 
 Does everybody? She's lying.. mom used to lie. Only you tell the truth?
[07:19] Stop it. Get tired. If I'm tolerating you in this house, its because of my kids.
[07:30] Please, remember this.
[07:43] Enough!
[07:47] And you.. leave all this and drink this juice. The doctor has told you not to..
[08:02] And I don't want to see you working around the house. And you're not following any of this nonsense.
[08:10] Fabiha, we'll go out for dinner. I don't want to eat at home.
[08:15] Can we go see mom, instead of dinner? I want to meet her.
[08:22] I'm sure.. she'll forgive me if she hears this news.
[08:30] Please..
[08:38] Alright. If you want this.
[08:43] Thank you. 
 You finish this juice please.
[10:56] You're coming after such a long time. 
 Yes. I'm busy with work but I thought I'd go check on Hamza since he's unwell.
[11:04] He's sick since morning and he doesn't want to go to the doctor. If you're here, tell him. He doesn't listen to me.
[11:13] Okay. I'll see.
[11:35] Farheen? You?
[11:48] Hamza.. didn't I tell you to go to the doctor. But you didn't listen to me or Haniya.
[11:55] What happened to the two of you? I'm not that sick.
[12:00] You're behaving as if I'd die if I don't see a doctor. 
 God forbid.
[12:08] If you don't speak good, don't say bad. 
 Alright. I'm sorry. Don't start like Fabiha.
[12:15] Alright. If you don't want to see the doctor, eat something so that you can take your medicines. 
 Alright.
[12:24] Alright. I'll leave now. I came to see you. 
 Wait..
[12:28] Why are you leaving like this? I'll drop you. 
 Whats wrong with you? You're unwell. I'll go myself.
[12:34] Whats wrong Farheen? I'm not so sick. I feel better. I'll drop you.
[12:39] Alright. Will you change? I'll wait with Hania. 
 Yes. You sit with Hania. I'll change and come.
[12:46] Alright. I'll wait in Hania's room.
[12:51] Listen, hurry up. Its late. Mom must be waiting.
[12:56] Alright. Sit with Hania. I'll change and come. 
 Alright.
[13:07] I only had one reason to hide Arham's second marriage from you.
[13:14] I was embarrassed.
[13:20] But when you found out, why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide? 
 Because you'd been hurt, Sanaya.
[13:28] When this has been written in my fate, why should I complain?
[13:33] The man who promised me to keep me happy all my life, now he has backtracked on his promise.
[13:43] I cannot complain to anyone. 
 Make yourself strong, Sanaya.
[13:50] Ever since that woman came into my life, she's made my and my kids' life hell.
[14:00] I don't understand what should I do? 
 You've never wanted bad for anyone. Nothing bad will happen to you Sanaya.
[14:11] This is just a temporary problem and this too shall pass soon.
[14:20] She had taken away Arham from me but now when she has a child..
[14:28] I will lose my kids' father as well.
[14:33] Hareem and Hadi idealize Arham.
[14:40] When they see their father pampering someone else,
[14:46] how will their minds be affected, I don't understand!
[14:52] I'm scared.. how will I handle everything alone. 
 Why are you thinking like this, Sanaya?
[15:00] I think you should give your relationship with Arham, some time.
[15:06] And trust me, nobody can take the place of the first wife.
[15:15] She has turned Arham against me so much that there is no place left.
[15:25] I'm fed up of her antics..
[15:31] Be strong Sanaya. I can understand that you're going through terrible times.
[15:40] But the only solution is to not let these problems burden you. Even if there is no light, the darkness won't last for long
[15:51] You should be strong.
[15:57] How can I be strong? I cannot be strong Shehla.. what can I do? 
 You'll have to tolerate everything. Not for Arham but for your children.
[16:31] I don't know how will my Fabiha be? Oh God..
[16:37] Wherever my daughter is, keep her happy. You're the Lord.. please have mercy and keep my daughter happy.
[16:54] Look at this Fabiha.. your childhood clothes. They're so cute. Whenever you have a child..
[17:04] I'll make him wear this first. 
 Why are you doing this long term planning? First Farheen will have children and then I..
[17:11] As God wills. I'll send you to your house with respect after you're married.
[17:18] Mom, am I a burden to you that you keep talking about sending me away? I'll not come back if I leave.
[17:34] I'll not come back if I leave.
[17:40] Yes Fabiha.. you did what you said.
[18:00] I'm going there but I don't know how mom will react. 
 Don't worry Fabiha. Aunty must have cooled down.
[18:09] I don't think so Arham. What if she throws you out, along with me?
[18:17] It will feel so bad. You'll be insulted because of me.
[18:25] You sit in the car, I'll go and meet mom. 
 This won't happen. I'll go inside with you.
[18:34] Whatever you've tolerated for me. I'll tolerate everything. Don't worry about me.
[18:44] You can but I don't want anybody to say anything to you. No matter if its my mother.
[18:55] Even if aunty slaps me angrily, I'll take that for you as well.
[19:03] I told you.. I'm with you. 
 Thank you so much Arham. You're very nice. 
[19:08] A little less than you. Now, smile..
[20:43] Will you not come inside?
[21:03] You go ahead..
[22:27] Farheen are you back? You got late today. Did Hamza drop you?
[22:52] Mom...
[23:27] Mom.. listen to me..
[23:32] Please sit.. I'll get you tea.. 
 No please. I don't take tea.
[23:37] Oh yes. You drink coffee. I'll get you. Please sit.
[24:15] Mom.. please talk to me once. What will ignoring get you? 
 Why are you here?
[24:26] You already killed your respect.
[24:32] Now do you want to kill your mother? 
 Mom.. its not that. I'm here to apologize.
[24:39] I have nothing to give you.
[24:44] Not even an apology.
[24:57] Don't say this mom. Its been such a long time.
[25:02] Please forget everything and forgive me.
[25:12] I'm your daughter.. 
 You did a lot as my daughter..
[25:22] There is an apology for mistakes, not sins..
[25:35] Mom.. you're turning my mistake into a sin.
[25:41] And I accept that I took a step against you but I didn't do anything that was prohibited.
[25:50] But what you're doing is wrong for your daughter.
[25:57] You fulfilled what Farheen wanted. What did you get out of it?
[26:04] You made your heart bigger for her and forgave her. Why not for me then?
[26:10] And as it is, I'm your son, mom.. 
 Don't emotionally blackmail me. Do you understand?
[26:21] Please make mom understand.. Ask her to forgive me. 
 She's upset with you. You'll have to make up to her.
[26:35] Mom, what was more important for you than my happiness?
[26:42] Even you wanted me to be happy. See, I'm settled now.
[26:48] I'm very happy with Arham. And I'm here to share my happiness with the two of you.
[27:02] I'm here to tell you that you're going to be a grandma and Farheen, an aunt.
[27:10] Isn't this good news enough to finish all misunderstandings?
[27:18] I'm on the threshold of motherhood.
[27:24] You're a mother, too.
[27:31] Will you leave me alone in this hour?
[27:37] Mothers support their daughters in this time. They stop them from the good and the bad.
[27:48] Please don't blame this child for what I did.
[27:56] Don't take away this relationship from him.
[28:03] Forgive me.
[28:10] Wounds don't heal.
[28:15] And the person who wounds you, your heart is flooded with hatred for that person. Remember that.
[28:31] I'm your daughter, mom. And which mom hates her children so much.
[28:43] And which daughter buries their mother alive? The day you destroyed my respect..
[28:56] I buried all my relations with you. You're nobody to me.
[29:12] And whatever you did with Hamza..
[29:16] Hamza.. Hamza.. Try and understand that Hamza's chapter is closed in my life, mom. I have Arham now..
[29:24] Then leave with Arham. What are you doing here? 
 Mom, Arham is very nice.
[29:33] He takes care of me. He loves me very much. I didn't have so many expectations from Hamza that I do have from Arham.
[29:49] And, ever since he got this news, he has made it compulsory to fulfill all my wishes.
[29:59] He fulfills all my wishes before I even speak. What more does a wife want from her husband?
[30:10] You can make your husband dance to your tunes, not your mother.
[30:17] Go. Leave! Right now.. Why are you wasting your time?
[30:26] You're increasing my blood pressure. Leave! Leave!
[32:18] Why isn't he answering the phone?
[32:36] Who are you calling?
[32:42] I'm calling Hamza. He wasn't well today but he insisted he'd drop me home.
[32:54] Thats why I was just asking about him.
[33:12] Alright, so he has become your driver and he gives you pick and drop?
[33:22] By the way, how much does he earn by driving a cab everyday? 
 Its not a cab. Its his own car. The office gave him that.
[33:33] The mart I work in, he's the sales manager.
[33:44] Fabiha.. you very hasty in judging Hamza.
[33:51] He lost you and reached her. Think about it. If you were with him, he'd have conquered the world.
[34:04] Its his hard work that he has all this. And yes, his mother's prayers are with him.
[34:22] No matter how much Hamza earns, he'll never be able to compete with Arham.
[34:35] Oh well. I was here to meet you. I'll leave now. I'll come back some other time.
[34:58] Lets go Arham. 
 Why?
[35:02] I have nothing left here. Lets go. 
 Fabiha..
[35:10] Bye..
[35:28] Fabiha, fix your mood. Aunty will not mellow down in one go. She'll need time. We'll try and go again.
[35:39] Thank you Arham. You're doing so much for me. 
 All this is nothing as compared to the happiness you're giving me.
[35:49] Thank you. Now fix your mood. 
 Okay.
[36:29] What is this? Now mom will scold you. You'll have fun then.
[36:43] I did mine. 
 Whats happening here?
[36:47] Nothing. I've completed all my questions. 
 Very good. Hadi show me what you're doing.
[36:58] Bad manners Hareem. What did you do Hadi? You had to multiply. You added these.
[37:03] Come here. Help your brother Hareem. See how mom is doing it? What is 2 multiplied by 3?
[37:12] 6.. 
 Yes. And 4 multiplied by 4 is equals to?
[37:17] 16. 
 Very good. Now you'll do the rest yourself and mom will check it.
[37:45] What happened mom?
[37:50] You seem worried.
[37:53] Mom is absolutely fine. You complete your homework. 
 My homework is done. Can I color now?
[38:00] Sure. 
 Mom, I'm done.
[38:03] Show me. Very good. Now take out your other notebook. 
[38:10] Mom.. Fabiha came but I was thinking what will Hamza think? 
 What will he think?
[38:19] He'll hear whatever you tell him. Don't put anything else in his mind. 
 Whats wrong mom?
[38:32] Why would I say something wrong to Hamza? I don't want him to get hurt. 
 Even I don't want him to be hurt.
[38:47] But I want to make up for the pain my daughter caused him. 
 Hamza is a very noble man otherwise,
[38:57] If Haris had been in his place, he'd have made a spectale out of our respect. 
 You should be grateful. 
[39:05] If you had listened to your mother, you'd be spending a respectable life in your husband's house.
[39:15] But no. You thought your mother was spewing poison at that time.
[39:22] Mom.. I have apologized for my mistake a lot of times.
[39:30] I know very well. If Fabiha comes here two three times, you'll forgive her. But no.. you'll never forget the mistakes I made.
[39:42] You have always done this and you'll do this again. 
 Put it out of your mind that I'll forgive her if she apologizes.
[39:52] Her mistake cannot be forgotten. Just like yours.
[40:08] Mom.. I know you think I'm a burden.
[40:17] But you'll get rid of this responsibility very soon. I'll not sit in your house all my life.
[40:28] Your pain will go away very soon.
[40:38] Farheen.. listen.. Tell me what you're thinking?
