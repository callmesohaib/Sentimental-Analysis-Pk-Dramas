[00:30] So now you knew. 
[00:33] How does a mother feel when someone treats her child harshly.
[00:40] So think...
[00:42] what would that mother feel whose son is snatched by someone else
[01:04] Hamza, can we talk for a few minutes?
[01:05] yes maam
[01:07] that day I had discussed about the care taker, but she didn't come
[01:11] sorry maam, actually there was an emergency on that day that's why she couldn't come
[01:20] what happened, all okay?
[01:22] yes yes maam, everything is alright. Actually her mother was not well so...
[01:30] Oh! I'm sorry. How is her mother now?
[01:34] she is better now
[01:36] Okay, so when are you bringing her? 
Actually I am in dire need of a care taker
[01:42] maam, can I tell you tomorrow?
[01:46] Kindly, do confirm by tomorrow otherwise I will arrange someone else
[01:50] Okay
[02:04] the police will thrash you so hard that you'll remember for lifetime. Leave my hand!
[02:09] are you threatening Haroon Mirza?
[02:11] didn't you hear? Leave her hand!
[02:13] What do you think? Are we weak, if we don't have any man in our house
[02:18] we know it very well how to treat such poor-spirited people like you
[02:21] it won't take even two minutes to ruin your daughter's honor, aunty
[02:25] Lets go!
leave her hand. Fabiha..
[02:28] Fabiha
[02:34] "Torn Poster Turned Out to be a Hero"
[02:36] is the picture complete now?
[02:38] its good that you came
[02:40] stop your non-sense & get out of here!
[02:43] I will return your money within 2 days
[02:46] you don't even worth a penny, yet you will return my money within 2 days!
[02:50] Ok fine, challenge accepted!
[02:55] if you didn't return my money within 2 days time, then handover Fabiha to me happily
[03:03] get lost!
[03:09] get out of here
[03:21] are you fine, Fabiha?
[03:24] aunty, don't worry
[03:27] I will handle
[03:42] Hadi, get away. Don't you see, what I am doing? Stay away.
[03:45] Arham!
[04:04] greetings mom!
[04:06] greetings! How are you Sanaya? You sound very tired
[04:15] what shall I do?
[04:20] Now, I feel more tired by Arham's words
[04:31] I had never realized it earlier
[04:36] Arham & I had started this journey together
[04:40] but now I am feeling as if..
[04:45] I am loosing my companion while reaching my destination
[04:50] what will I do of such a destination?
[04:55] where I will be alone
[04:57] but not with my companion
[04:59] dear, one should not loose hope so soon
[05:03] everyone faces good & bad times
[05:05] one needs to show patience & show some courage
[05:09] and the stars doesn't sparkle at all times, nor does a human's fate
[05:14] So, one needs to wait for the night time to see the light of the stars
[05:20] dear, even you have to wait for good time
[05:23] after night, we have a hope that we'll see a new sun in the morning
[05:31] they say it right
[05:33] nobody can replace a mother's presence
[05:36] now see
[05:37] in what condition & problem Arham must be
[05:41] so, you should be supporting him
[05:45] Only a good wife can understand that what does a husband needs at this time
[05:51] and how worried he is, he needs your support
[05:55] and if he gets frustrated sometimes
[05:58] then dear, you need to tolerate it
[06:02] specially in this condition
[06:04] and dear look, I am telling you clearly
[06:08] that we make the basis of our family in the beginning
[06:11] and your family stays intact on that basis
[06:16] you are absolutely correct, I was just...
[06:19] Ok leave everything. I was thinking that you haven't visited our house since so many days
[06:25] So come tomorrow night, we'll have dinner together. Ok?
[06:31] I've become such a stranger for you, right?
[06:34] dear, daughters are strangers
[06:38] I will let you know, I am hanging up now
[07:09] you are getting worried now, right?
[07:11] I've been telling you since so long to do the care taker job, but no!
[07:16] didn't you find it important to tell me?
[07:19] are you so grown up to take your own decisions?
[07:22] I am your mother & I am still alive
[07:24] mom, I wanted to tell you but...
but what?
[07:26] aunty, I had forbidden her
[07:30] that's why she didn't tell you
[07:33] dear, what's the use of it?
[07:35] the problem is still standing on our doorstep
[07:38] until when it will follow us, I don't know
[07:41] I am a daughter's mother
[07:43] until when I will feel embarrassed from you
[07:46] what's there to be embarrassed about, aunty?
[07:49] You & Fabiha are my family, and we don't feel embarrassed in front of our families
[07:53] this is your grateful nature
[07:58] why are you saying this?
[08:02] You are embarrassing me by saying this
[08:07] and in my sight...
[08:10] the people giving their daughter's shouldn't bend but the one's who takes the daughter shall bend
[08:14] why are you worrying?
[08:16] you consider me your son, right?
[08:19] then a mother shouldn't be worried while their son is here
[08:23] how can I not worry?
[08:25] after all, I have only one son
[08:28] God forbid, if something would have happened to you then?
[08:30] but nothing happened to him, mom
[08:32] and if Haris had been here at this time, then he wouldn't have stepped back too
[08:36] Leave it! All of this happened because of her
[08:39] She had put her sister's life at stake for the sake of her happiness
[08:43] why are you cursing me, mom?
You've just fulfilled your duty
[08:48] if dad had been alive, then he would have done the same. You haven't done any favor on us
[08:51] But no, everyone blurts poison for me in this house
[08:56] children are like this, they remember their duties
[09:01] but they forgot their mother's duties
[09:05] may God show you the right path, Farheen
[09:10] Mom, don't worry otherwise you'll get sick
[09:14] leave it, can't you see how she argues with me
[09:18] now go, bring me a glass of water
[09:25] why are you standing now, go!
[09:39] Fabiha, at what time is your interview today?
[09:44] at 10:00 AM
[10:03] Sanaya haven't read my messages as of yet
[11:45] mom, where is sister-in-law?
[11:48] where she had to be?
She has gone to do others slavery by leaving her mother-in-law in this condition
[11:54] I don't understand brother
 he is like... "One moment you weigh, the next moment you measure"
[12:00] his mother is sick, she is lying in the house like this... but no!
[12:04] He wants his wife to do the job
[12:08] we had tolerated your loneliness until you were fine, but now?
[12:13] even I didn't spared her, Hadia
[12:16] the way I had portrayed her in front of Arham
[12:22] that he had scolded her too much. Also, he had fixed her very well!
[12:25] its good! Now you'll see that they won't talk to each other for a few days
[12:30] then she will understand
[12:31] oh my naive mom, what do you think?
is brother Arham getting all this done?
[12:38] instead sister-in-law is getting this done
[12:39] you are forgetting one thing
[12:41] brother Arham is your son, but he is not only his wife's husband
[12:46] but his wife's slave too
[12:49] In front of us, he pretends as if decisions are honored. But its not the actual thing
[12:55] only sister-in-law's decision is honored at all times
[12:58] and what are you thinking? The decision of keeping a maid for you, is this brother Arham's decision?
[13:03] its of sister-in-law's
[13:05] listen to me
[13:07] you have to give tough time to sister-in-law
[13:10] then I will see, how brother Arham won't let his wife resign from her job
[13:15] and doesn't ask her to stay at home. Understand?
[13:29] sister
[13:55] come, have lunch
[14:00] I don't want to eat
[14:02] as my stomach is full from mom's poison
[14:06] she is our mother, why do you think this way about her?
[14:12] you are her dearest...
[14:15] earning daughter
[14:18] What do you know
[14:21] that how difficult it is to live without a mother's love
[14:27] I feel so jealous whenever I see you & Hamza in place of mine & Haris
[14:37] every child is equal for a mother, sister
[14:41] her motherly love can never think bad for you
[14:45] she does your competition with me
[14:49] the day I will compete you, you'll see
[14:53] even you will start disliking me
[14:56] I can never dislike you
[14:58] this is your misunderstanding
[15:00] the time will tell that who will dislike whom
[15:04] Fabiha, for now please go away as I am not in a mood to argue at all
[15:08] I had thought...
[15:11] that I will go to see off Haris at the airport but..
[15:14] nobody cares about my happiness in this house
[15:16] nobody realizes it
[15:19] when our loved ones become strangers, then how can we complaint about the time
[16:29] have you applied for the loan?
[16:32] I did
[16:34] there are chances to get an approval by tomorrow
[16:38] what if it didn't get approved?
[16:41] then we have to vacate the house on the last notice. What else Arham?
[16:45] do I have any other option?
[16:47] what else can I do?
[16:49] you didn't even let me capable enough to seek loan from my family
[16:57] I've talked to sir, there might be some solution of it
[17:03] even last time you had said the same thing
[17:06] but then I had to take a loan from my office
[17:09] and till date we are paying its installment. Now one more
[17:12] the expenses will be doubled
[17:15] Sanaya, my promotion is pending for the time being
[17:18] as soon as I will be promoted, my salary & allowance will be doubled. All the expenses will be cleared
[17:26] until yesterday, you were against my job
[17:29] so today, from where this self-esteem came from?
[17:31] Sanaya, you know I am emotional. And I don't understand anything in anger
[17:36] but try to understand my compulsion too
[17:38] who is standing in front of the family, outsiders & relatives?
[17:41] I am standing
[17:43] I answer everyone
[17:44] a man whose wife is working, people do various questions from him
[17:48] and I face them all
[17:50] people ask, who is with the old mother
[17:53] Sanaya, I answer all the questions
[17:57] I kept thinking at the office at all times, whether mom took her medicine or not
[18:00] whether she got her food or nor, is she fine or not
[18:04] do you have an idea that how my day is passed?
[18:08] like every man, even I want my wife to take care of my mother
[18:11] but I cannot do this, because I am helpless
[18:15] because our needs are too much which can only be fulfilled by the jobs of both of us
[18:19] but No
[18:22] you won't understand this, because
[18:26] you don't see me compelled
[18:47] The sip of patience is bitter
[18:51] but one gets to see a sweet result who showed some patience
[18:57] its bad time for us
[19:00] instead of passing this time by fighting
[19:04] it would be better to spend it with love with each other
[19:11] I have talked to Hamza, tomorrow he will tell me finally about the care taker
[19:16] otherwise, we'll arrange some other girl
[19:52] here you go brother, your tea
[19:56] what are you searching for?
[19:57] Hania, you do remember that I keep all the documents at one place
[20:02] I had kept my bike papers here as well
[20:04] why do you need bike papers?
[20:06] actually I want to keep my bike as mortgage
[20:10] you want to keep your bike as mortgage, means?
[20:11] talk softly, what's wrong with you?
[20:15] and where is mom?
[20:18] but if you'll keep your bike as mortgage, then how will you go to office?
[20:23] the way everyone else goes, I will go by bus. Not a bit deal
[20:28] but what as such the emergency is, that you need to keep your bike as mortgage?
[20:31] what if mom gets to know, then?
[20:36] mom will not get to know anything, if you'll keep your mouth shut
[20:41] as far as I am concerned
[20:43] so I will make an excuse
[20:46] You know how difficult it was for mother to get you this bike
[20:52] a person does hard work in good times, so that it can be helpful for it bad times
[20:59] keep all these things inside
[21:10] tell me the truth, who stole the jewelry from my cupboard?
[21:13] what do you mean by asking me? 
You can ask this question from Fabiha as well
[21:17] I am asking you! Tell me truly who took the jewelry?
[21:20] mom, how would I know? You are asking me as if I have stolen it
[21:24] stand up! Put your hand on my head & swear upon my life that you haven't stolen them
[21:29] swear upon my life!
I haven't stolen them
[21:32] keep your hand on my head, now speak up!
[21:41] sister is right
[21:43] only fortunate people gets a companion like Hamza
[21:46] but what shall I do of this heart, who doesn't beats for Hamza
[21:49] it only remembers his favors
[21:51] I did a very big mistake
[21:55] I shouldn't have taken the money from Haroon
[21:59] not only you did the mistake
[22:02] But I did it too
[22:04] I should have stopped you
[22:07] but what to do
[22:09] I had forgotten this due to the fear of Farheen's spectacle
[22:13] that our honor will be tarnished
[22:19] mom, only weak people face such spectacles
[22:21] Fabiha, Hamza's support will never let you become weak
[22:32] mom, Hamza is also a weak person like us
[22:37] the actual reality is that a person's biggest strength is money
[22:43] and Hamza doesn't have it
[22:45] no dear
[22:47] every man's strength is his honor & respect
[22:54] Hamza tries to explain you, his love & respect is purely for you
[23:00] if some other man had been in his place then
[23:02] he would have left you long time ago on this matter
[23:09] consider Hamza's endless love as your strength
[23:13] as far as Haroon's matter is considered
[23:19] we'll return his loan by selling off the jewelry that I have kept for you both
[23:26] Mom, but you had made that jewelry for me & sister
[23:31] No dear, nothing is more precious than one's respect
[23:36] remember this!
[24:11] he had switched off this whatsapp since 8 hours for a 3 to 4 hours flight
[24:18] if mom gets to know that I have stolen the jewelry, then she'll kill me this time in real by giving me the poison
[24:24] I'm calling him since morning, and he is not attending my call
[24:29] I won't become weak in front of my mother this time
[24:42] Fabiha
[24:44] Fabiha
[24:46] what happened?
[24:49] I was fixing my cupboard, and the jewelry is missing
[24:52] what do you mean, the jewelry is missing. It must be here, check carefully
[24:55] where are they?
 am I lying? the jewelry is not here
[24:59] Ok, you might have kept them somewhere else. Tell me, let me find it
[25:02] I haven't kept them anywhere else. I think they are stolen
[25:05] mom, how can they get stolen? We are just 3 people in the house
[25:08] no fourth person visits us, please sit let me find it
[25:13] mom
[25:15] did you gave them to someone?
[25:17] Farheen, what are you doing?
[25:23] Nothing mom, I came to get the charger
[25:28] Okay
[25:31] let me bring your tea
[25:39] mom
[25:40] mom, I am asking you
[25:43] hey, mom!
[26:26] yes mom, did you call?
[26:28] hmm... I want to go to the bathroom
[27:02] be careful
[27:42] tell me the truth, who stole the jewelry from my cupboard?
[27:45] what do you mean by asking me? You can ask this question from Fabiha as well
[27:49] I am asking you! Tell me truly who took the jewelry?
[27:52] mom, how would I know? You are asking me as if I have stolen it
[27:55] stand up! Put your hand on my head & swear upon my life that you haven't stolen them
[28:01] swear upon my life!
I haven't stolen them
[28:03] keep your hand on my head, now speak up!
[28:06] yes, I have stolen. I took the jewelry
[28:13] you did robbery in your house, you looted your mother
[28:17] this is my children...
[28:20] there might be a miss in my upbringing
[28:23] Tell me, what you did with that jewelry?
Mom!
[28:25] Tell me, where is the jewelry? What did you do with that jewelry?
[28:30] I sold them
you have sold them?
[28:32] you sold the jewelry? What!

[28:37] where is the money, tell me
[28:41] I gave them to Haris for the ticket & visa
[28:44] have some shame!
mom...
[28:46] oh God...
[28:48] I am looted, she took away my entire life's savings
please sit here
[28:54] Don't know how much injustice this selfish child did with me
[29:02] mom, please sit
what will I do now?
[29:06] my lifetime's savings are looted
[29:08] please sit. Mom!
what will I do?
[29:10] such a selfish child... oh God!
[29:14] please sit...

[29:16] mom...
mom!
[29:18] what happened?
Call Hamza, quickly!
[29:21] mom, what happened?
Mom!
[29:23] its all because of you. If something happened to mom then you'll see
[29:27] mom, please open your eyes
[29:38] send Arham to me
[29:41] you called & here I am
[29:44] Since you are here, so take me to the bathroom. As your wife has clearly refused
[29:51] what happened to you mom, just now I took you to the bathroom
[29:59] are you lying!
[30:02] how you've changed your colors like a chameleon as soon as you saw your husband
[30:19] she is right
[30:21] mom, you have your own weight
[30:23] what if you fall while going, you'll get injured or your bone will break. It will be a problem then
[30:29] so its better for me to do this work. 
You want to go to the washroom, right?
[30:33] let me take you, its ok
Please move the wheelchair
[30:38] No
[30:42] leave it
[30:44] I don't want to go
[30:48] I don't want to go now
[30:50] its ok
[30:53] I will rest 
[30:54] Okay
[31:00] one second, let me fix the pillow. Move a bit
[31:04] like this, yes.. 
[31:16] do switch off the lights while leaving
[31:20] Okay
[31:23] shall we go?
[31:30] I am keeping this bell next to you, do ring it if you need anything
[31:38] I will come again after some time
[31:53] Hadia was right
[31:57] he just pretends in front of me
[32:02] he doesn't even speak in front of his wife
[32:16] where have you gone... 
[32:18] after leaving me alone
[32:22] there is no one to listen to me
[32:50] Fabiha
[32:57] Fabiha
[32:59] compose yourself, aunty will be fine. Nothing will happen to her
[33:03] come her, sit down
[33:06] sit
[33:10] Fabiha, show some courage & tell me what happened
[33:14] aunty was absolutely fine until evening, then what happened all of a sudden?
[33:17] our luck is so bad, Hamza
[33:20] the loved ones supports each other during bad times
[33:28] but here, our loved ones have become our enemies
[33:31] what had happened?
[33:34] sister had sold mom's jewelry that she had saved for us
[33:42] it was her entire lifetime's savings. And she couldn't tolerate it, when she got to know about it
[33:46] what are you saying?
[33:49] mom was relieved that she will save her daughter's honor by selling that jewelry
[33:55] but sister took away that hope too
[34:00] Ok don't worry, let me arrange the money
[34:04] don't worry, we'll arrange something
[34:06] from where you'll bring such a hefty amount, Hamza?
[34:10] try believing me, Fabiha
[34:12] I will get drowned myself, but I won't let your trust break
[34:18] why do you consider yourself alone? I am here with you
[34:24] talk to your madam
[34:27] I am ready to do the job
[34:29] but only upon your trust
[34:41] how is mom, what happened to her?
[34:43] patient got a heart attack, we cannot say anything right now
[34:59] Fabiha
[35:03] nothing will happen to her, don't worry
[35:05] everything will be fine
[35:30] do you really think that I didn't took mom to the bathroom?
[35:36] what to do
[35:39] just arrange a care take immediately
[35:48] I am telling the truth, I took mom
[35:54] Sanaya, I cannot say that my mother is lying
[35:59] no matter even if she had lied
[36:03] there is a possibility that mom had become frustrated due to this illness
[36:11] obviously!
[36:14] the work she always used to do by herself
[36:16] today she needs our help for that work, she had to call us to do that work
[36:21] and after calling us, she had to wait for us
[36:27] and this matter is based upon one's entire life
[36:33] I think, we should consult a good psychiatrist for mom
[36:39] in such an illness, a person doesn't gets to know or realizes that what he is doing
[36:45] maybe you are right
[36:48] even a fine person will become crazy if he'll stay locked inside a room
[36:55] let me speak to Sunny, he has a family doctor. Lets meet him
[37:05] ok listen
[37:10] yes
[37:13] mom has invited us on the dinner tomorrow
[37:21] Okay, we'll go
[37:25] but their mood... 
[37:29] No
[37:33] I will talk to brother tomorrow after going home
[37:39] I have to go & see
[37:42] what is the mood & situation of my family
[37:50] you did robbery in your house, you looted your mother
[37:54] this is my children...
there might be a miss in my upbringing
[38:12] Fabiha
[38:35] how is mom?
[38:37] there is nothing to worry about, the patient is out of danger now
[38:44] thank you so much, doctor
[38:47] but please be careful that she doesn't have any tension or stress
[38:52] if she gets another attack, then her survival will be difficult
[38:55] Ok better, we'll take very good care of her
[39:01] can I meet my mother?
[39:02] We are shifting her to the ward, then you can meet her
[39:16] Fabiha, I had told you that nothing will happen to aunty
[39:21] Hamza, you've been with me for an entire night. Do one thing
[39:24] go home & rest for a while
[39:27] and did you talk about my job?
[39:30] yes, I have talked
[39:32] we have to go today to meet them
[39:35] don't worry about aunty
[39:37] Farheen is here to look after her, ok?
