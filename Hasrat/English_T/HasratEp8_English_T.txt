[00:13] I am in big trouble.
[00:18] I have all my necessities on my one hand and my mother on the other.
[00:23] I am unable to understand that what should I do.
[00:26] Arham
[00:29] Don't worry.
[00:31] This bad time will pass.
[00:34] What is the dowry amount.
[00:37] Sister, what do you say, it's around fifty one thousand. What is your opinion?
[00:45] Five hundred thousand rupees.
[00:49] Five hundred thousand? What are you talking about sister. Think about marrying your daughter.
[01:02] Everyone was asking about you in Asad's wedding. You should have gone with us.
[01:07] Mom you know that it's not that easy to get leave from office.
[01:13] I forgot to ask you because you were busy in Farheen's marriage function. Why are you tensed these days.
[01:22] No. Actually, it's because of official busyness.
[01:30] He is making excuse of office work. In fact he has fought with sister-in-law.
[01:37] By the way
[01:39] I think sister-in-law has beaten you very hard.
[01:42] No problem, keep doing that. Your sister is here
[01:46] I will give you hot milk with turmeric.
[01:50] Haniya, behave, he is your elder brother.
[01:57] Mom, why are you scolding her?
[02:00] She is my younger sister and she can make fun of me.
[02:05] But she should say something which doesn't make other person feel bad. What will your sister-in-law think if she heard that.
[02:12] Don't worry, Fabiha doesn't mind this.
[02:17] Are you happy now?
[02:22] You have made very nice tea.
[02:25] Well, Khalida called me and she was asking about wedding of Haniya.
[02:33] What do you say about it?
[02:37] OK, do whatever you feel better.
[02:41] And I was also thinking that you should talk about fixing mine and Fabiha's marriage date with aunt Shaheen.
[02:50] Why are you saying this so suddenly.
[02:54] Is everything alright?
Yes, everything is alright.
[02:59] I want to tie knot with Fabiha now.
[03:04] Is there anything wrong between you and Fabiha?
[03:08] You look a bit worried.
[03:12] No, there is no such thing. Every thing is fine among both of us.
[03:18] It would be better if this distance may remove as well.
[03:23] Mom, you should understand that he wants that he doesn't want to go to her house to get beaten by her. So he wants to bring her here.
[03:30] You are so naughty today.
[04:18] Fabiha
[04:21] Did you tell mom about Haroon?
[04:27] No
[04:31] Don't tell her. She will get worried for no reason and her blood pressure will shoot up because of tension.
[04:38] Doctors have strictly advised to save her from any kind of tension.
[05:13] Who is calling?
Hamza
[05:18] Receive call, talk to him and tell him everything.
[05:22] I can't receive his call.
[05:24] I am scared from his craziness.
[05:26] If I told him then he will do something. So, I can't tell him.
[05:33] Listen Fabiha, you need protection at the moment.
[05:38] And he is your protector.
[05:43] If you will tell him about everything then you will feel very strong.
[05:48] Remember one thing.
[05:50] It's become very difficult to save a drowning person.
[05:57] And by the way
[05:59] You don't have any other option except Hamza
[06:02] He loves you so much and he will get ready to do anything for you.
[06:07] He will arrange not only four hundred thousand but also four million if required.
[06:14] Are you getting my point?
[06:18] Good, I am your elder sister.
[06:22] I will never give you any wrong and bad advice.
[07:09] Mom, here is your tea.
[07:11] And please don't ask me to do anything else.
[07:14] Hadiya, it's been four days since I am in this room.
[07:19] Take me to lawn on wheel chair so that I will take tea there.
[07:24] Mom, you are seeing that I am doing my packing but your wishes are endless.
[07:30] And do you think it's an easy task to hold you.
[07:34] I can't do that alone.
[07:37] I will ask brother Arham, he will take you out when he comes. Take your tea.
[07:46] And from now on, ask brother Arham to do your work.
[07:49] He should realize about his responsibilities.
[07:54] You are my offspring as well and it's also your responsibility.
[08:01] Mom, you have made me stranger by marrying me so I have responsibilities of my in-laws' house now.
[08:10] I can't fulfill responsibilities of both my in-laws' house and my mother's house and does anyone care about me and my daughter.
[08:18] It's been two weeks but my brother didn't even take his niece for dinner outside.
[08:24] No. Only I have to take care of everyone but no one will take care of me.
[08:30] And from now on, you should take care of yourself.
[08:41] I will feel very sad after your departure.
[08:46] You should have stayed for few more days.
[08:49] Mom, I am leaving very respectfully now.
[08:53] If I stayed for few more days then your daughter-in-law would have pushed me out.
[09:05] Muskan
[09:34] Mom
[09:37] Mom, come here, breakfast is ready. Your tea will get cold.
I am coming.
[09:43] I am coming. You make noise.
[09:50] That's very nice
[09:53] I am surprised to see this glow on your face today. Is everything alright.
[10:00] Yes
[10:02] I am happy that you paid attention towards me.
[10:04] And you saw happiness on my face.
[10:08] My child, I want you to stay happy throughout your life.
[10:16] Mom
[10:17] If you weren't that stubborn then you would have seen this happiness on my face much earlier.
[10:24] Now look, it's so good.
[10:26] Uncle arranged visa for Haris and we also arranged money.
[10:32] Well
[10:35] When will Haris go?
[10:39] He didn't tell me anything about that but he promised me that he will arrange to call me there within six months.
[10:52] I think Hamza has arrived. Let me inform Fabiha.
[11:06] O God.
[11:08] May my daughters' happiness not get effected by evil sight.
[11:19] Yes sir, I will be ready for online meeting at 11 AM. Don't worry. OK.
[11:25] Muskan get ready
[11:27] Hadiya, breakfast is ready. Do I serve that for you?
[11:30] Wow
[11:32] You are serving mother-in-law and sister-in-law by leaving your office work.
[11:36] By the way, I couldn't believe that you will be convinced so quickly to leave your job.
Don't let your belief break Hadiya.
[11:43] Job is our necessity and mom is our responsibility.
[11:46] And neither me nor Arham will back off from those.
Yes it's obvious.
[11:51] How will a liberal minded girl hold such a big responsibility.
[11:55] You should be courageous enough to keep yourself in the house.
[11:59] By the way, I am not sure about you.
[12:01] A girl like you who can leave her own children at her mom's house.
[12:06] What will she do to her mother-in-law? My mom just have few days left and she will pass that period.
[12:13] You should think before saying something.
[12:16] If we consider responsibilities as burden then life becomes difficult.
[12:20] And if we fulfill those as our duty then even bad time will pass very easily.
[12:25] But you can't understand this.
My mother is going through a bad time
[12:30] If my mother-in-law was not ill then I would never leave my mother on your support.
[12:38] Are you going back?
Yes, it's obvious.
[12:42] I can't leave my mother-in-law dying like you are doing.
Hadiya.
[12:47] Truth is always bitter.
[12:49] And
[12:51] By the way, it's time for my flight so if you may please allow my brother to drop me to airport.
[13:10] Relax. Relax Sanaya.
[13:40] Fabiha, Hamza has arrived.
OK.
[13:57] What are you doing? He will bother us more if we will do this.
[14:03] Are you mad? Be sensible. There is no need to talk to him.
[14:09] You should ignore him at the moment. He will stop calling you.
[14:13] And listen, you are not alone in this house, I am also a girl, at least you should think about me.
[14:19] If anything bad happened then you know about Haris' mentality.
[14:24] Listen
[14:26] I think you should switch off your mobile for a few days.
[14:29] And also tell Hamza about this matter.
[14:32] Otherwise I will definitely tell him.
[14:35] You are a girl and you can't handle him alone so let Hamza deal Haroon.
[14:44] Go, he is waiting for you.
[15:00] Sanaya give me my wallet.
[15:04] Sanaya.
I am here.
[15:16] Thanks
[15:22] Hadiya is going back today.
[15:27] I know.
[15:32] If you knew about that then why didn't you tell me?
Her mother-in-law is sick.
[15:37] So it would be better for her to take care of her mother-in-law.
[15:46] She is waiting for you downstairs. You have to drop her at airport.
[15:58] Has mom done breakfast.
[16:00] Yes, I am going to give her.
[16:02] Did you talk to caretaker? Is she coming?
[16:05] Yes, I talked to her. She will be late.
[16:08] OK, let's meet in the evening.
[16:29] I know that Haroon must be the reason behind this refusal.
[16:33] Fabiha how long will you keep sitting at home by getting scared from Haroon?
[16:37] Maybe you have forgotten that you need this job.
[16:42] Not every person is like Haroon.
[16:45] And I know madam Sanaya's family very well.
[16:50] They are well educated.
[16:52] And I can trust them with close eyes, that's why I am sending you there.
[16:56] I don't know what is going on in your mind.
[16:59] Even Haroon was well educated.
[17:03] Not necessarily every educated person is good.
[17:06] It's good to be a human being.
[17:09] And
[17:10] I am scared because of that incident so I... Please.
[17:14] If I am with you then you don't have to be scared from anyone.
[17:19] I want to do office work. No matter whatever that may be.
[17:24] But I can't do caretaker job. Please.
[17:28] OK relax. Relax.
[17:32] It's your decision and you are free to take your decisions.
[17:40] Tell me that I called you so many times last night, why weren't you receiving my calls?
I had slept.
[17:49] Do you know that I couldn't sleep whole night.
[17:52] I kept thinking about you.
You do it daily, there is nothing new.
[18:00] But there was a strange restlessness in my heart.
[18:04] I felt as if you are very worried and you need my support. You want to say something but you are unable to say that.
[18:14] But maybe I am thinking a bit more.
[18:20] Fabiha
[18:22] Please tell me the truth that you are not hiding anything from me.
[18:27] No Hamza. I...
[18:34] How long Haroon has been calling you?
[18:38] Tell me Fabiha.
[18:40] He wants his money back.
[18:48] Street number 46, house number 212, lane number 4.
[18:57] How long will you run away from me.
[19:00] Have you forgotten that day's beating.
[19:02] Oh, it's Mr. Hamza.
[19:05] It's my habit that I never forget anything.
[19:10] I didn't kill you that day but if you won't stop bothering Fabiha then I will kill you.
[19:18] I am not afraid of your mere threats.
[19:23] You don't know about me.
[19:26] You were lucky that day that you went away safely otherwise my dogs were sufficient for you.
[19:34] I am not afraid from dogs like you.
[19:40] But I want to spare you Mr. Hamza.
[19:44] Why are you putting your life at stake.
[19:48] It would be better to get away from my path.
[19:54] What if I won't do that then?
[19:56] Let's make a deal.
[19:59] You can take whatever you want.
[20:09] Just handover Fabiha to me.
Just shut up.
[20:14] I will gouge out your eyes if you even try to look towards Fabiha. Fabiha is only mine.
[20:40] He is bothering you, why didn't you tell me?
[20:44] I didn't tell you because of this extreme reaction of yours.
[20:50] Fabiha listen to me very carefully
[20:55] No matter if I kill anyone but you won't hide anything from me.
[21:02] You can't fight against Haroon, why don't you understand that?
[21:10] It would be better for me to return his money as soon as possible.
[21:19] I will arrange that.
[21:23] But how will you arrange?
[21:26] Fabiha, I will arrange that amount somehow but you don't have to be afraid from Haroon. I am with you.
[21:34] I will sell my bike and do anything else.
[21:38] But we can't arrange four hundred thousand rupees by selling your bike.
[21:42] Be sensible instead of this enthusiasm.
[21:52] So you want to say that my mother is liar.
[21:57] Listen Sanaya, mom didn't eat anything since morning and her insulin didn't inject as well.
[22:00] No one is taking care of her.
[22:01] If you can't fulfill your responsibilities then tell me.
I brought her breakfast but she threw away the tray.
[22:07] And as far as insulin is concerned so I thought that Hadiya would have injected her before tea.
Stop it.
[22:11] You always mention Hadiya, don't handover your responsibilities on Hadiya.
[22:15] I am telling you Sanaya
[22:17] If anything happened to mom then our relationship won't continue.
[22:39] Mom, I have brought breakfast for you. Eat quickly, my meeting is about to start.
[22:54] Hadiya gave you tea? Did she inject insulin?
[22:59] What difference does it make?
[23:02] Whether insulin is injected or not and your mother-in-law lives or dies.
[23:08] Attend your meeting.
[23:12] Are you happy that you forced Hadiya to leave this house?
[23:19] My daughter has gone back. What else do you want?
[23:38] What are you talking about? No one has forced Hadiya to leave this house, she has gone with her own will.
[23:45] Whatever happens in this house is with your will.
[23:52] We can only breath without your consent.
[23:58] If that is in your authority then you won't allow us to do that.
[24:09] Eat breakfast quickly.
[24:12] I don't want to eat. Take it back.
[24:16] Don't argue. Eat a bit.
[24:30] I hate to see your face.
[25:08] Boss must be calling me
[25:14] Five missed calls.
[25:20] Yes sir.
This is very unethical miss Sanaya.
[25:23] You should have been aware of meeting time.
I am sorry sir. I am really sorry.
[25:27] Try to distinguish between office and domestic work.
[25:32] Because client doesn't care that your mother-in-law is sick or your children. Thankfully, client requested us to delay the meeting for half an hour.
[25:39] Otherwise, I would feel embarrassment because of you.
[25:42] I am extremely sorry sir. You won't get embarrassed because of me.
[25:45] I'll be very careful next time.
It's OK. I am taking you on conference call.
[25:51] OK sir.
[26:03] Good morning sir.
[26:25] Eat my child.
Greetings mom.
[26:27] How are you feeling now?
[26:29] Greetings. Stay blessed.
[26:34] Sanaya called me.
[26:37] She told me about her promotion.
[26:39] OK
[26:41] I talked to her and she told me as well.
[26:44] It's a game of luck.
[26:47] Hopes are increasing as well as burden of responsibilities.
[26:51] It's good thing about time that it passes whether it's good or bad.
[26:56] This time will also pass.
God willing.
[27:00] By the way, Hadiya was very concerned about her mother.
[27:04] She didn't care and humiliated her sister-in-law's family.
[27:08] She is thinking that we are responsible for this condition of her mother.
[27:14] She came here for two months to take hold of responsibilities.
[27:17] So she should take care of her mother. She would know about the burden of responsibilities.
[27:23] She is going back.
Oh I see.
[27:27] Where has her love for her mother gone?
[27:30] Mom, if I was in place of Sanaya then I would have treated Hadiya rightly.
[27:34] Sanaya has a great opportunity to humiliate her just like she humiliated us.
[27:40] Then what will be the difference between her and us?
[27:44] Mom, your this silence will cause damage to your daughter someday.
[27:52] What are you talking about?
I am just saying what I am observing.
[28:04] Take some more and eat quickly.
[29:21] The way you have made me to live alone Sanaya
[29:28] If I didn't make you to live alone like this then change my name.
[29:48] She doesn't receive call.
[29:51] I don't know whether insulin is available at home or not.
[30:06] Greetings mom.
Greetings. What happened?
[30:10] You look worried.
[30:12] Is everything alright?
[30:13] I am fine mom.
[30:17] Tell me about your interview.
[30:28] What happened to her?
[30:31] She was in good mood when she left.
[30:34] Did Hamza say anything to her?
[31:09] What happened? Why are you so quiet? Did you argue with Hamza?
[31:13] Did you talk to Hamza?
[31:17] I couldn't do that.
What do you mean?
[31:22] We were in restaurant and Haroon called me.
[31:25] Leave that call.
[31:26] Tell me that you talked to Hamza about returning that amount. Will he return Haroon's amount
[31:32] Yes
[31:34] First he will sell his bike and then he will sell his house.
[31:37] Then he will sell himself and return all his amount.
[31:41] You are talking nonsense. It's not a minimal amount.
[31:46] He has to fulfill his responsibilities and I don't want to take any favor from him. I will do that myself.
[31:52] Really? So tell me, what are you plans?
[31:59] Sister, I am searching a job. As soon as I will get a job. I will take loan and return all his amount.
[32:06] But what if you didn't get any job then?
[32:09] And if this is the plan then you should ask Hamza to do that. He will return that amount.
[32:55] I have been calling you since last two days but you have received my call now.
[33:00] Where have you been? Do you know, how worried I am.
[33:04] Where will I go? I am here in your heart.
[33:09] You just talk like this.
[33:12] My dear Farheen, there are so many processes of visa approval. I was busy in that.
[33:18] My visa has got approved.
[33:20] Really
[33:22] Thank God.
[33:23] Haris just leave this country as soon as possible.
[33:26] Lest Fabiha ask you to return her money.
[33:29] I won't stay here. I am leaving and my flight is scheduled tomorrow.
[33:34] Tomorrow?
Yes tomorrow.
[33:36] Farheen, but I...
But what Haris. Tell me.
[33:44] Anyways, just leave it.
[33:46] Actually, I don't want to make you more worried.
[33:49] Haris
[33:50] I will get worried if you won't tell me. Please tell me, what's the matter?
[33:56] Actually, I can't make arrangement to call you there immediately.
[34:03] I am not asking you to do that immediately.
[34:06] You can do that after four to six months.
[34:09] There is no chance until eighteen months.
[34:13] Eighteen months?
[34:18] Haris
[34:21] How will I live here without you for such a long time?
[34:26] Think about me as well. How will I live alone there without you?
[34:30] The amount which Fabiha gave us was utilized in visa's of mom and me.
[34:34] And from remaining amount I deposited that for the accommodation for one year.
[34:40] So how can I call you there without any job.
[34:44] You will have to wait.
[34:46] But how much?
[34:49] I won't be able to do that.
[34:51] Please do anything and arrange money.
[34:54] Tell me, what can I do?
[34:56] We even sold out mom's jewelry otherwise I would sell that for your sake.
[35:02] Now I can only manage if I will get a job.
[35:13] How much amount is required?
[35:18] Around two hundred thousand.
[36:01] Mom, what happened? Is everything alright?
[36:09] I have a severe headache.
[36:13] My head is spinning as well.
[36:16] My body is shaking.
[36:22] I haven't eaten breakfast nor insulin is injected since morning.
[36:28] I have been ringing bell for so long but Sanaya is not listening.
[36:34] The voice of a compelled person even reach heavens.
[36:40] But I don't know why doesn't anyone listen to me.
[36:47] Sanaya
[36:50] Sanaya
[36:52] Yes, what happened?
Mom is ringing bell for so long, didn't you listen?
[36:56] No, mom didn't ring that bell. Why wouldn't I come if she did that?
[36:59] Sanaya if I can come here after hearing bell sound then you can also come.
[37:03] And
[37:07] Did you hear that sound? Did you?
[37:12] Tell me.
[37:18] This is my bad luck.
[37:22] You can see that she is denying me in front of you.
[37:30] I am not telling a lie.
[37:36] So you want to say that my mother is liar.
[37:41] Sanaya, mom haven't eaten since morning and insulin was not injected. No one is taking care of her.
[37:45] If you can't fulfill your responsibilities then tell me. I am telling you.
[37:50] If anything happened to mom then this relationship won't continue.
[37:55] Don't stand like this. Bring insulin and make breakfast for her.
[38:27] I am not neglecting my mother. I am concerned about her.
[38:31] I am worried for her all the time.
[38:32] I trusted you after God that you will take care of her.
[38:36] But you are unable to do that. Tell me so I won't get hopeful from your side.
[38:41] We have hopes with those person only who can fulfill those hopes.
[38:45] You knew in one day that I can't fulfill your hopes.
[38:49] Did I ever give you any opportunity to complain?
[38:52] I have so many responsibilities like office, children and household chores and I am managing all my responsibilities very well.
[38:58] By thinking that we are one and together but our responsibilities are segregated.
[39:04] Dad. Dad.
[39:06] Dad. Dad.
Hadi, get away.
[39:09] Aren't you seeing what I am doing? Get away.
Arham
[39:16] What happened Arham? He is just a kid.
He is mine.
[39:20] I will teach him what is right and what is wrong. So stay out of it.
