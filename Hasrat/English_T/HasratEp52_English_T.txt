[02:07] parents await their children's happiness in their old age
[02:18] But my fate took a toll on her in her old age
[02:31] she couldn't tolerate it
[02:40] that's why I never wanted to bother her
[02:52] how will we spend our life without her?
[03:02] she never did anything bad for anyone
[03:09] nor she wanted anything bad for anyone
[03:13] then why my mom was treated so badly, brother?
[03:31] Sanaya, I had promised her
[03:38] I will never let you feel the absence of your father in your life
[03:55] your brother promise you
[03:59] he will never leave you alone
[04:04] Why did Mom die, brother?
[04:19] Perhaps her life was meant to be this short
[04:27] I had never thought that Arham
[04:30] will become such a stone-hearted person
[04:40] He became completely obsessed with that woman
[04:49] He doesn't care for me or the kids at all
[04:53] neither he cared about my mother's folded hands
[05:04] today I am leaving my matter on God, brother
[05:45] God has willed it Fabiha, you have got such a big garden in your house
[05:52] You can grow vegetables for yourself; this way, you'll be able to save money too
[06:03] I am so stupid, you don't have any lack of money now, right, Mom?
[06:10] I am thinking that the person who realizes he will face the consequences of his actions.
[06:25] So, why haven't you thought that way about yourself?
[06:32] what path you're following
[06:34] do you even know what will be its consequences?
[06:42] Fabiha, I am scared of that woman's curse
[06:54] Whose family you broke and created your own
[06:57] mom, what are you saying? What happened?
[07:03] I haven't broken anyone's family
[07:06] Whatever happened with Sanaya, it happened because of her own actions
[07:14] When a woman does not give time to her man, then she may face similar consequences to what happened with Sanaya
[07:22] her professional life was more important for her, than Arham
[07:29] and what about man, mom
he gets influenced to any other way anytime
[07:32] don't make her fault my sin
[07:35] you will be saved from a woman's curse, Fabiha
[07:39] but how will you be saved from a mother's curse?
[07:45] And think about those kids whose father has left them.
[07:50] when I haven't done anything wrong, then why shall I be scared?
[07:55] You are unnecessarily worrying yourself by thinking about such things, and you are also worrying me.
[07:59] Sanaya was trying to harm my baby, which is why Arham kicked her out of our house.
[08:05] you will tell me this Fabiha
[08:10] Was Sanaya killing your baby in real?
[08:17] Arham saw that with his own eyes, mom
[08:22] I am not lying
[08:24] really?
[08:26] Then swear on your to-be baby's life?
[08:38] swear upon him
why did you stop?
[08:47] tell me
[08:48] mom, this baby is not only mine but you also have a relation with him
[08:55] You should be more worried about him than me. I don't know why you don't trust me?
[09:05] And I am telling the truth, Arham took such a big step when he saw this
[09:10] Otherwise, why would Arham have done this without thinking long and hard?
[09:13] Fabiha I agree that you are my daughter
[09:15] And for every mother, her children's happiness is most dear to her
[09:23] but honestly speaking, I am so upset about Sanaya
[09:26] and her kids
[09:33] I have always distinguished between right and wrong
[09:41] so how come now I shall say the wrong thing as right?
[09:47] there is a difference between snatching & getting it easily, mom
[09:53] I haven't snatched anything from anyone, Arham came to me himself
[09:57] so, how can I pronounce my fate as wrong?
[10:03] but still I tried my best to stay together & live with each other
[10:07] But her jealousy prevented me from finding my place in this house or in Arham's heart
[10:17] but still I tried to adjust, mom
but nothing got fixed
[10:21] but your prayers are with me, so nothing will go wrong now
[10:25] dear, my prayers are always with you
[10:29] they were always there, and they'll be always there for you
[10:35] mothers always pray for their children happiness
[10:39] I will always pray for your happiness
[10:42] a mother's prayers are never refused, mom
[10:45] that's what I am scared of
[10:47] what if your happiness gets affected by someone's evil eye
[10:52] anyways, leave all this
[10:54] Tell me, did you go to the doctor? What did they say? Is everything okay?
[11:00] mom, everything is fine & the baby is healthy
[11:02] thank God!
[11:04] by the way I am happy that
[11:06] Arham is a nice person & he takes very good care of you
[11:10] you also take care of him
[11:15] Fabiha look, being a mother I would like to give an advice to you
[11:21] this bungalow, this car, this money...
[11:25] it doesn't have any importance, dear
[11:30] if you have to sacrifice it for Arham, then do it
[11:39] there is no value of money, dear
[11:42] you can earn money anytime, it will come again
[11:45] mom, what are you saying? Its all mine & why will I spend it on someone else?
[11:50] dear look, a loan is returned
[11:58] and Arham is a loan for you from Sanaya
[12:02] always remember that
[12:14] anyways Fabiha, its very late now. Can you please call a cab for us?
[12:20] yes sister
[12:30] sister, I can't find any cab right now
[12:34] try to book it from your phone
[12:36] ok, one minute
[12:47] No Fabiha, even my request is not being accepted
[12:54] do one thing, ask Arham to drop us
[12:59] hey no...
[13:02] We'll go on the auto rickshaw, its okay
[13:05] what's wrong with you mom, how will we go alone in the rickshaw so late night?
[13:09] ok wait, let me call Hamza
No..
[13:13] there is no need to call Hamza here
[13:16] why?
[13:19] What's the harm, Mom? If Hamza comes to pick us up, he'll wait outside. He won't come inside.
[13:27] As it is, Hamza had told me that if I go somewhere at night, I should not come back alone. I should call him
[13:32] let me call him, no problem
[13:49] hello! Hamza
[13:59] Sanaya
[14:03] I am taking out some food for brother
[14:08] I know he hasn't eaten anything since coming back from the graveyard. Don't you worry.
[14:16] I will feed him the food
[14:18] even you haven't eaten anything
[14:28] hunger, thirst.. everything got buried with mom
[14:36] gather yourself, Sanaya
[14:40] I don't understand that...
[14:43] for which grief I shall cry out loudly
[14:51] on one side, I have the grief of my family and on the other side
[14:55] I have my mother's grief
[15:04] I will share my mother's grief with my brother but..
[15:09]  a mother gives courage for the other thing, sister
[15:15] we are with you
[15:21] you are not alone
[15:24] I know you are with me
[16:26] food..
[16:32] I am not hungry, feed this food to the kids
[16:40] You know, Mother never used to sleep until you ate your food.
[16:54] She also knew that I couldn't sleep without her
[16:58] Why did she leave me?
[17:07] brother...
this room
[17:10] this room had peace due to her presence
brother...
[17:15] brother, look here. Gather yourself
[17:19] if you will shatter in this manner then how will handle us all?
[17:27] as it is, this life is a journey
[17:30] when & how anyone's journey's end, nobody knows
[17:36] look at me, look here
[17:41] how I am standing in front of you, after loosing everything
[17:46] I am left with my brother only
[17:48] if you'll shatter in this manner, then on whose shoulder I will cry upon brother?
[17:54] control yourself for God sake, please
[17:59] I cannot
[18:02] I am not getting shattered
[18:07] I am feeling so weak after losing such a great support like a mother
[18:13] I am feeling so scared
[18:16] brother, this is the time to nurture our relations
[18:21] to support each other, & to wipe off each others tears
[18:29] I cannot see you crying like this
[18:34] what's the big deal, if our mother is not here
[18:37] You have a sister who is like a motherly figure to you
[18:53] do you know Sanaya
[19:00] Very few people have someone to wipe away their tears
[19:03] gather yourself, brother
[19:08] I cannot see your crying, for God sake please gather yourself
[19:14]  gather yourself
[19:17] I am fine
[19:21] drink some water
[20:41] dear, take very good care of yourself. Ok?
[20:43] you also take very good care, mom
[20:46] bye!
[21:04] Hamza!
[21:05] shall we go?
[21:09] lets go dear
[21:59] Fabiha aunty, I'm feeling hungry. Please give me some food
[22:05] ok fine, go & sit on the dining table. I am bringing it
[22:08] and listen! Don't call me again & again. Sit with patience
[22:12] Don't come into the room. It wouldn't be good if you come in there
[22:15] come on, go
[22:37] Arham
[22:39] where were you?
you didn't even come home the entire night
[22:48] I am asking you something, where were you?
[22:53] I was at Sanaya's house
[22:58] at least you could have informed me
[23:03] Fabiha, her mother died
[23:09] what!
[23:12] that's why I was stuck & couldn't tell you
[23:16] but how come all of a sudden?
[23:22] I was about to divorce Sanaya
[23:29] and during that her mother got a heart attack
[23:36] her mother died because of me, Fabiha
[23:43] I took away everything from Sanaya
[23:49] I don't know what to do
[23:54] I did such a grave mistake
[23:58] I don't understand anything Fabiha..
[24:01] that how shall I gather everything?
[24:07] Sanaya... kids
[24:10] I have ruined everyone's life
[24:19] neither I am a good husband or a good father
[24:26] what's wrong with you Arham, gather yourself I am with you
[24:30] Sanaya needs me Fabiha
[24:38] I should be with her
[26:13] Hello!
[26:17] Hello! Greetings
[26:20] how are you, sister?
[26:24] A person whose mother has passed away would likely experience profound grief and sadness
[26:33] you have also experienced this pain, and you can understand it very well
[26:40] yes, I do have an idea
[26:47] Actually, I couldn't talk to my brother; perhaps he was busy with the funeral the entire day
[26:57] that's why I am calling very late for the condolence
[27:05] Sister, how did all of this happen? I can't believe it.
[27:12] what happened all of a sudden?
[27:16] nothing happened all of a sudden, Hadia
[27:19] all of this happened because of your brother
[27:27] he gave me a horrible punishment of being his wife
[27:31] what do you mean?
[27:32] he came to take away my children from me
[27:36] your brother came to divorce me
[27:43] divorce!
[27:45] He left our relationship stranded in the middle of obstacles
[27:50] he had started
[27:52] but now I will end it
[27:58] I am sorry, sister
[28:04] We all are responsible for your destruction
[28:08] its nobody's fault, Hadia
[28:14] If the person whom I loved the most is no longer with me, how can I complain about others?
[28:26] tell your brother
[28:30] that Sanaya will never forgive him
[28:39] I had entrusted Arham's love to myself
[28:47] but now my love is a loan on Arham
[28:51] I will take back everything
[30:47] hello!
[30:51] brother...
[30:54] I didn't expect this from you
[31:03] brother
[31:05] a lot had happened
[31:09] and you didn't even tell me
[31:17] After Fabiha arrived, sister Sanaya left your heart in such a manner
[31:24] that the matter had reached to an extent of divorce
[31:27] Hadia, I made a mistake while being emotional
[31:31] being emotional?
[31:37] brother, do you know
you always do like this
[31:44] you make rational decisions, then you regret upon them
[31:52] you had lost your mother while being emotional
[31:59] and now its turn to loose your wife & children
[32:06] This girl has blinded you with a web of lies
[32:14] that you can't see anything
[32:18] Hadia, tell me what shall I do?
[32:21] honestly, I don't understand anything
[32:24] shall I tell you, what you should do?
[32:29] just wait
[32:34] just wait for sister-in-law's revenge
[32:38] I had a word with her
[32:41] She has clearly said that she will never forgive you
[32:50] and for sure, she will take revenge from you
[33:02] brother...
[33:07] please don't do this
[33:13] handle everything by any means
[33:19] Don't take Sister Sanaya's curse
[33:22] its not right for you
[33:28] what do you think?
[33:30] the delusion in which you are
[33:32] that if you ever have any regret or anything bad happens to you
[33:39] then this girl Fabiha will support you
[33:46] do you really think that she will support you?
[33:52] She will be the first one to leave you
[33:56] then you will realize
[34:03] please brother, don't do this
[34:09] I don't understand one thing, brother
that how come you couldn't see
[34:18] If a girl couldn't belong to her own mother, then how will she belong to you?
[34:23] Hadia, even I am sorry about Sanaya
[34:29] honestly speaking, even I am not getting peace after all this
[34:32] you will not get any peace, brother
[34:37] shall I give you a suggestion?
[34:42] if you really want to see yourself in peace
and seek tranquility
[34:49] Then tomorrow are the funeral proceedings for sister's mother
[34:53] please do visit there
[34:58] spend time with your children, spend time with sister Sanaya
[35:07] shall I say one more thing to you?
[35:12] Please ensure to take Hadi over there
[35:16] and leave him there
[35:18] please
[35:20] I cannot leave Hadi there
[35:26] You know I cannot live without my kids, and I had left Hareem over there while thinking about it
[35:35] but nobody will see that
how much a father suffers because
[35:41] Maybe a man doesn't know how to express what he is going through
[35:49] a man is always wrong
[35:52] always...
[36:31] were you talking to Hadia?
[36:34] yes
[36:35] what was she saying?
[36:36] Nothing special, she was just talking about here & there
[36:39] go to sleep, its quite late night
[38:26] I was about to divorce Sanaya
[38:30] and during that her mother got a heart attack
[38:37] her mother died because of me, Fabiha
[38:44] I took way everything from Sanaya
[38:50] I did such a grave mistake
[38:54] I don't understand anything Fabiha..
[38:57] that how shall I gather everything?
[39:03] Sanaya... kids
[39:06] I have ruined everyone's life
[39:12] what's wrong with you Arham, gather yourself I am with you
[39:16] Sanaya needs me Fabiha
[39:23] I should be with her
[39:34] If Sanaya's sympathy remains in his heart in the same manner, then one day she will be present in this house
[39:39] you need to do something before that, Fabiha
