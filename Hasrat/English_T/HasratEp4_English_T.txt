[00:13] Because of you Shenaya will have a tough time at her in-laws.
[00:16] Because of me?
Yes.
[00:19] How come because of me? It was Shenya's mother-in-law that did everything.
[00:25] Anayah is our daughter and you should feel as bad as I do.
[00:30] I didn't expect this from you.
[00:35] My mother was being humiliated in front of you and you kept watching.
[00:42] Will I be truthful if I swear on Karim's life.
I can tolerate everything but...
[00:48] what I cannot tolerate is someone alleging my mother falsely!
[00:59] Haris, prepare to leave for Muscat soon.
[01:04] My dear I didn't know that your love could prove to be so lucky for me.
[01:09] Just remember one thing, I won't let you leave without a marriage ceremony.
[01:15] Do you think I'll leave you alone here? You don't realize how much I love you.
[01:22] I feel like marrying you today.
[01:28] That's what I love about you.
And don't you stop thinking about me.
[01:33] If something were to happen to you, I won't survive.
[01:38] Do you love me that much?
My dear, love has no weight...
[01:44] otherwise I would have showed you how much I love you.
[02:00] Your sister-in-law was rude and she is the one that should apologize. If it was an internal matter I would have forgiven her...
[02:08] but this was in front of outsiders, hence she should apologize.
[02:17] You sister-in-law will have to apologize, only then will I be able to live respectfully in this house.
[03:05] You're trapped! You could have gotten out.
[03:10] You could have gotten out....
[03:43] No...
[03:49] Please help me...
[03:53] Please get me out of this.
[04:27] Mother, please make me apple juice.
Apple juice?
[04:32] My dear we don't have apples.
But you know that I have apple juice in the morning every day.
[04:38] I'm sorry my dear, I didn't know. If I had known, I would have asked your uncle to get apples for you.
[04:44] I'll make apple juice tomorrow, alright?
What happened my dear?
[04:50] You know that I drink apple juice every day in the morning, but there are no apples.
[04:56] Then why are you here? I'll ask granny to make you apple juice.
[05:03] Alright?
[05:07] I didn't know Hadia...
[05:12] How would you know? You're not at home all day.
[05:17] How would you know what we have and what we don't have at home.
[05:40] You might remember it or not, but my brother does remember that my daughter drinks apple juice in the morning.
[05:50] If you had checked the fridge then you wouldn't have refused.
[05:59] No matter how you feel you shouldn't take it out on kids.
[06:05] Hadia...
[06:09] Come on Muskan, I'll make apple juice for you in a while.
[06:19] I won't have breakfast without apple juice.
[06:22] My dear, granny isn't well and you know that mother doesn't use aunt's things.
[06:28] Please, skip it for today.
[06:35] Greetings*
[06:40] What's the matter? No apple juice today?
Please explain it to her...
[06:46] Nothing will change if you don't drink apple juice just for one day.
Shall I make you apple juice, Muskan?
[06:54] No... I won't have breakfast.
[07:01] Greetings*
[07:05] Alright then...
What happened?
[07:09] My leg are heavy in the morning, hence they twist.
[07:15] Are you alright?
Yes I am...
[07:19] this happens everyday.
[07:22] You will visit the doctor with me today.
I told you I'm fine.
[07:26] No you're not. You don't get insulin on time, and you're worried about home.
I'll take her to the doctor, don't worry.
[07:34] Muskan... here is your apple juice...
Mother... french toast!
[07:39] Where's Muskan?
She's late. Muskan is upset and in her room.
[07:44] She's here... you could have calmed her down.
I will.
[07:54] Mother, where is my french toast?
[08:17] Fabiha!
[08:20] Where are you? Your phone is ringing.
[08:27] See who it is.
[08:33] Hello...
[08:36] Yes it is...
[08:41] Yes... I'll reach your address on time.
[08:46] Farewell.
[08:50] Sister... I'm hired!
[08:54] I thought that it was uncle
[08:57] I'll call him after I wake up.
I'll let Hamza know.
[09:01] Don't make much noise, I'm sleeping.
[09:09] Good morning ma'am*
[09:14] Don't you guys have anything to do? You guys are always laughing!
[09:18] Bring me a coffee to my room.
[09:30] Hi beautiful...
Hi handsome.
[09:33] I just got a call from the agency, I've been hired.
[09:38] That is amazing... you might not have believed in yourself, but I did.
[09:44] I need to be at the location by ten, can you pick me up?
Right now?
[09:49] I mean if you're busy, I'll catch a cab.
[09:54] No... have I ever refused?
[09:59] The boss is not in a good mood, but that's my problem. Get ready, I'll be there.
[10:06] I'm waiting for you... bye.
[10:14] What are you looking at?
[10:16] Continue working, remember what the boss said...
[10:21] Coffee... hurry up.
Sure.
[10:41] Greetings*
[10:43] You used to pick my phone at a single ring, but you don't now. Are you upset with me?
[10:53] No mother... I was busy.
[10:57] I called because the kids haven't returned from school.
[11:01] That's why I decided to ask you.
[11:06] Yes...
[11:10] The kids won't be return.
[11:12] Really... is that just for today, or everyday?
[11:16] No mother it's not like that. You know how Arham is.
[11:21] He makes hasty decisions out of emotion. He'll change his mind.
Where are the kids?
[11:26] You know my colleague Sofia, right? They are with them.
[11:32] Mother exaggerated things in front of Arham?
I expected your mother-in-law to do something like that.
[11:40] But what I don't understand is how long will Sofia keep your kids?
[11:47] That's what I don't understand either...
[11:50] Even though she embarrassed her guests, she won't stop being stubborn.
And to that she also added a condition in front of Arham.
[11:58] Condition... what condition?
[12:01] That...
[12:05] sister Somia will apologize to her.
[12:08] Is she insane? Does she want everyone to do her bidding?
[12:13] But mother think about it with a cool mind... this is a matter of your daughter's life.
[12:17] If sister Somia doesn't apologize to Hadia, then mother will go to Dubai and Arham will be distanced from me.
[12:22] I don't want that at all.
Shenaya, this isn't possible at all.
[12:27] And I will not agree to this at all!
[12:32] Alright mother...
[12:35] Help sister-in-law...
[12:38] Don't worry about me...
[12:41] I'll suffer for the rest of my life.
[12:43] A bride's mother makes her home and her husband is her peace at her in-laws home.
[12:48] What will I do if both are taken from me? I'll be stuck in between.
[12:53] All men are the same... just keep listening to them...
[12:59] if you do that they'll fulfill all our wishes, but...
[13:04] if we contradict them, then we are made to be the enemy.
[13:10] He's my husband.
[13:12] You're the one who told me that to make my husband happy I agree to everything he says.
[13:18] I listen to everything he says.
[13:23] Mother I don't know how, but fix it. Farewell!
[13:28] Alright... farewell.
[13:42] Go ahead, I'll be right there.
[13:45] Madam, may I come in if you're free?
[13:48] Please have a seat.
[13:56] Are the kids home?
A long time ago, I'm sure they are playing right now.
[14:02] Thank you...
Coffee?
[14:08] Were you talking to Shenaya mother?
[14:11] Yes.
What did she say about the kids not being here?
[14:16] Arham has refused...
That's weird...
[14:20] They made the mistake and they want to put it on us.
[14:25] Shenaya is right... it is our mistake...
[14:30] And we should be the ones to apologize.
What is our mistake?
[14:34] Apologize for what? I'm sure Shenaya asked you to do this..
[14:39] How much more will Shenaya bend in front of her in-laws? How much more will she embarrass us?
[14:45] To make their lives at their in-laws, women have to..
[14:51] sacrifice their wants and needs.
[14:54] She has to listen and agree to everything, whether it be right or wrong.
[15:00] Look... Shenaya is standing by her in-laws... as should you...
[15:06] Apologizing does not make anyone big or small. Rather it stops relationships from shattering.
[15:14] If you apologize to Shenaya's mother-in-law...
[15:57] Greetings...
[16:15] Greetings*
[16:25] Yes...
[16:29] Is there no woman in this house?
[16:34] I wouldn't need you if there was.
[16:38] I'll show you my mother's room.
[16:42] Please.
[16:50] Come in... this is my mother's room.
[16:54] And this is my mother.
[16:57] Her entire body has been paralyzed, she can't speak or get up.
[17:04] You'll have to take care of her.
[17:07] And yes...
[17:12] This is all of her medicine...
[17:18] Sorry about that...
[17:21] It's okay.
[17:24] Here you are.
[17:29] This is her closet. My mother clothes are here.
[17:33] I expect that you'll have her changed everyday. I don't want her clothes smelling.
[17:38] Don't worry, I'll take care of her.
[17:43] Can I ask you a question?
[17:47] Sure.
[17:50] You are beautiful, you seem to be from a good home..
[17:55] then why are you doing this odd job?
[18:01] When one has the responsibility of a home, then they don't show any disparity between a job or an odd job.
[18:11] Are you married?
[18:17] No...
[18:21] Alright...
[18:24] I take good care of my employees...
[18:28] I try that they are not bothered by anything. If you need an advance salary or any money at all, please don't hesitate to tell me.
[18:37] All you have to do is let me know. I just want one thing in return...
[18:46] Just take care of my mother. I love my mother very much...
[18:51] I cannot see her in any pain. I'm sure you'll do your job diligently
[18:57] If you need anything, you'll find Pir Baksh in the kitchen downstairs, you can ask him.
[19:03] He will tell you all about my mother medicine timings and what she has to eat.
[19:09] I'll get going... I have an important thing to take care of.
[19:15] Alright...
Yes.
[19:40] This fell down.
[19:45] I'll see you.
[19:52] There is still time... it make no difference if one gets upset with us...
[19:58] but if a husband gets upset, then the entire world seems against you.
[20:04] If mother leaves with me, then you'll lose your husband as well.
[20:16] Shenaya... I don't understand how you face all this.
[20:21] So much trouble for a job... and I don't understand what's wrong with your mother-in-law.
[20:27] If I hadn't been earning, I would have been taunted with not caring about money.
[20:32] And if somehow she starts earning, alongside fulfilling her responsibilities...
[20:37] then the world thinks that her professional life must take all of her time.
[20:40] They wonder if her kids eat, or is her husband happy.
[20:44] They think that their home life suffers. But my life is good... my kids take good position in school...
[20:51] My husband is fed, his clothes are ironed and his mother is medicated on time.
[20:56] Whether it be a job or business... it's not easy to earn money.
[21:01] One has to give everything and after all that one has to be a mother.
[21:06] If your child is sick, you have to be up all night with them.
[21:10] Who cares if I eat or not? Even if I get some time to rest, there is always something else to do, or there are office commitments.
[21:20] I'm also a human being and I have a heart too
[21:29] No one cares about me...
This is your power, try to understand it at least.
[21:34] You care about anyone's happiness, apart from yours.
[21:39] It doesn't happen that way. Time heals all wounds.
[21:44] This will fill all of your wounds... enjoy life and chill.
[21:51] What you're doing is great!
[22:21] If I don't say anything Junaid, that doesn't mean that you get to remain silent.
[22:27] I will not tolerate anymore injustices towards me.
[22:34] Who is being unjust to you?
Your mother and sister.
[22:39] Will we do everything that Shenaya's husband tell us?
[22:43] Is this why you made me your wife, so that I may apologize to your sister's in-laws?
[22:49] It's not like that... you're angry right now...
[22:53] Sit down... please....
[22:59] Listen to be careful. What is a brother's responsibility? To keep her sister happy, right?
[23:05] And to help his sister when she's in trouble.
[23:10] A good wife is someone who stand by her husband.
[23:13] Is it not the responsibility of a husband to have his wife respected?
Apologizing won't disrespect you.
[23:21] One who apologizes has a big heart...
[23:24] You know you weren't silent back then.
[23:30] When my husband is against me, then I can't complain against the world.
[23:35] I'm not against you... what I'm trying to say is that if you had remained silent then things wouldn't have gotten so far.
[23:43] Apologizing won't belittle anyone.
[23:48] Somia...
[23:52] For me...
[23:53] Please do this...
I love you Junaid...
[23:59] but that doesn't mean that I'll do whatever you ask of me.
[24:05] If you pressurize me more, I'll take Anayah with me to my mother's home.
[24:13] But I will never apologize to Shenaya's mother-in-law.
[24:50] Fabiha, I'm coming to pick you up.
[24:53] You say ten minutes, but rather take an hour instead.
[24:58] If you are one more minute above ten, I'll leave on my own.
Listen to me.
[25:03] Say I love you, just once.
What will that do?
[25:06] That will make my heart big and this road small and I'll be there quickly.
[25:15] When the time comes...
[25:19] Hello...
[25:31] Let go of my hand...
[25:33] I gave you the ball to exercise...
[25:37] This is not to play cricket.
[25:41] I was helping her exercise... I got a call in  between.
[25:47] Who was it?
[25:51] It's my brother... he's coming to pick me up.
[25:53] Refuse...
What?
[25:56] Ask him not to come.
[25:59] I'll provide you with pick and drop services. Especially for you.
[26:02] I can come and go on my own. I can manage that myself.
[26:05] And I don't like repeating myself.
[26:11] We're not allowed by the agency to take favors. I could lose my job.
[26:17] I will hire your personally.
[26:20] Starting from today...
[26:23] you can become my mother's personal caretaker...
[26:28] You don't need to assist any agency...
[26:36] I will call your agency...
[26:45] You didn't call...
[26:48] I was about to...
[26:59] I'm on my way... what's the emergency?
[27:04] Don't come here.
[27:07] I shouldn't come? What's the matter?
[27:13] You seem disturbed... what happened?
[27:17] My employer called, he won't be back for a while. He asked me to stay... I'll have to stay here for a while.
[27:24] Don't come here. I'm sorry I wasted your time.
It's not about that...
[27:30] I worry about you...
Don't worry... I'll make it home.
[27:34] But how?
[27:43] Sir's driver will drop me home. Farewell.
[27:49] Why would the driver drop you? I will do it.
[27:58] Here... keep this.
[28:02] For what?
[28:05] I told you in the morning that I take care of my employees.
[28:10] You are a white collared woman... I know you won't ask for it.
[28:15] You won't tell me if you need money or not.
[28:20] Keep it... this is your advance salary... keep it.
[28:27] Thank you... I'll bring my bag...
[29:02] Alright... you can book mother's flight with me.
[29:16] I've talked to Sameer... he's getting the tickets.
[29:22] Mother, you haven't changed your mind to leave?
[29:27] When children can make their own decisions...
[29:33] then mothers should change their decisions.
[29:42] We can't force anyone to either apologize or respect someone else.
[29:49] It would be better for mother if she comes with me.
[29:55] Do you think it's right if you stay with your daughter's in-laws. I will be embarrassed in front of everyone.
[30:03] Do you want me to be humiliated? What else do you want?
[30:07] Should I stay here and get embarrassed in front of everyone under your wife's allegations?
[30:16] Shenaya apologized to you... why don't you move on?
[30:22] If things are left the way they are...
[30:26] then you will never have any respect in your in-laws home.
[30:32] Your mother has decided this after giving it much thought.
[30:37] It's easier to hit someone when their down. Rather than someone who walks, looking straight ahead.
[30:42] So it would be better for you if you respect your mother's wishes.
[30:56] Dinner is served. Come on kids get up and go to the dinner table.
[31:03] Be careful
[31:07] Yes Sameer...
[31:11] The seats have been confirmed... alright...
[31:21] We're leaving tomorrow night, at eight.
[31:38] Alright...
[31:46] There is still time.
[31:48] It doesn't matter who gets upset at us...
[31:52] but if a husband gets upset then it seems the entire world is against you.
[31:58] If mother leaves with me... then you will lose your husband as well.
[32:08] Think about it.
[32:26] I understand.
[32:29] Greetings...
I'll talk to you later.
[32:38] How are you?
[32:39] I'm well, you're quite late today.
You know how traffic is...
[32:47] That's true...
[32:50] This is the house rent and money for rations.
[32:55] Really...
[33:00] Fabiha... why don't you keep some money with you...
[33:05] You might need it...
[33:08] Mother, I have money, you keep it.
[33:15] What's the matter?
[33:17] You should have been content today...
[33:22] The rent is taken care of... then why are you so worried?
[33:41] Mother sometimes it really dawns on me...
[33:46] that in this society it's very hard for a woman to live without a man.
[33:54] Father is gone... I don't have a brother.
[34:00] It seems we're living in a glass house.
[34:04] One stone and everything will fall apart.
[34:11] My dear...
[34:14] this is all fate's test.
[34:18] A house that has no man, in that house a woman has to act like a man.
[34:26] What about a place with no woman?
[34:31] Men cannot compete with women.
[34:35] And... men cannot survive without women.
[34:41] Women are so strong... that they can fight against the world.
[34:49] But...
[34:52] women have a weakness...
[34:55] That is her honor.
[35:00] Whose protector...
[35:02] are only men.
[35:08] What if that protector tries to harm women?
[35:23] Mother...
[35:25] You're worrying like I'm really taking you to Dubai tomorrow.
[35:31] What do you mean?
Meaning, I didn't call Sameer.
[35:36] You did call in front of Arham.
[35:39] It's nothing... it was just drama.
[35:41] I've put pressure on brother and sister-in-law...
[35:45] That is what will expose them.
[35:50] You lied?
Where will I go if Shenaya's sister-in-law don't apologize tomorrow?
[35:58] What will I do?
[36:02] If your brother finds out, you will look so bad in front of him.
[36:07] What will he think about you and me?
[36:13] You worry for no reason mother...
[36:16] Nothing will happen... I've planned everything...
[36:21] This is between a mother and wife. Like how a mother can't live without her son...
[36:27] Just like that a wife can't live without her husband. So sister will do anything and everything for my brother.
[36:35] Even if she has to make her family bend in front of us.
[36:41] What if Arhum calls Sameer?
Why would he do that? To embarrass himself?
[36:49] That's what I'm pressuring him with.
[36:53] I feel dizzy.
[36:56] I don't understand what you're doing!
[37:01] Mother... save this for later. This will come in handy tomorrow.
[37:13] They will have to apologize.
[37:51] Sister...
[37:55] has refused to apologize.
[38:10] Arhum...
[38:16] Arhum, mother is right.
[38:20] She can apologize... she's free to...
[38:24] but because of me... we cannot pressurize her.
[38:29] Besides, I don't want to ruin her home.
[38:35] Don't you care about ruining our home?
[38:39] You don't care about my mother leaving me.
I don't want that... please listen to me.
[38:46] I tried to convince her... but she isn't listening... what should I do?
[38:52] Keep yourself in my place... how can I make them do it?
[38:57] Wow!
[39:00] You love your family, but what about me? You are supposed to love me as well.
[39:08] You are the one who proclaimed your love!
[39:12] You promised to stay with me, listen to me and spend time...
[39:16] There were never conditions between us.
[39:22] That's the difference between the love of a husband and wife.
[39:29] The love I have for you is peace to my soul.
[39:36] One can always repay a loan. But in love...
[39:42] one has to sacrifice.
[39:47] I love you in such a way... but you...
[40:10] Alright fine...
[40:13] If I have to sacrifice my motherhood to prove my love for you... then fine...
[40:20] I swear on my child's life...
[40:26] neither my mother or my sister-in-law said anything.
[40:31] Your mother was the one who cursed us.
[40:42] Do you believe me now?
[40:48] Are you happy now?
