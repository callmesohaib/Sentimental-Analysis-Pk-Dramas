[00:13] Will you take me there forcefully?
Yes, I will do that if I have to. So it would be better to agree peacefully.
[00:19] And what if I don't agree then?
[00:23] This relation is hanging over three words.
[00:25] If my sister marriage will be broken then your marriage will break as well.
[00:27] Where are you taking him?
Listen to me. Mr. Inspector. Wait minute.
[00:33] Mr. Inspector what's going on?
[00:34] You are making very big deals and you are very busy.
[00:38] But what have I done?
[00:40] You are a thief.
[00:42] You have stolen Mr. Haroon's money. You are a thief.
[00:53] OK fine.
[00:59] Haroon has spoiled our lives.
[01:03] He was bothering Fabiha earlier and now he asked police to arrest Hamza.
[01:08] He won't leave us without taking his money.
[01:11] Mom
[01:16] Mom will scold me if I tell her about this.
[01:22] Just leave it Farheen. It's better to stay quiet.
[01:27] We will see when mom will know about it.
[01:34] Mom, show some courage, your health will deteriorate more.
[01:37] How can I do that my child?
[01:40] Police has arrested my son.
[01:43] And you know that how police treats prisoners. God knows what would they have done to him.
[01:50] I am unable to understand that who the hell this Haroon is.
[01:53] Brother never ever cheated anyone so this Haroon
[01:59] I think brother must have hid something very significant.
Only Hamza can tell us about that.
[02:06] Take me to police station.
[02:09] And what will you do by going to police station.
[02:12] Will they release him if you go there.
[02:16] So who will make an effort to release him?
I have called sister Fabiha, she will do something.
[02:21] Drink water.
No.
[02:23] Fabiha shouldn't go to police station.
[02:27] Mom she is a working girl and she must have some contacts so she will do something.
[02:33] No, she is a female. It's not good that she may go to police station.
[02:38] Call her and stop her to go there. We will do something. It's not good for her to go there.
[02:58] Listen sir, this boy has embezzled four hundred thousand rupees of Mr. Haroon.
[03:02] Pay outstanding amount of Mr. Haroon and get his bail.
[03:06] Sir, we had the money then this wouldn't have happened. We requested for some respite from Mr. Haroon.
[03:11] So you can understand that if Mr. Haroon is not giving him respite then how can I release him.
[03:17] We are performing our duty sir.
[03:19] Listen Mr. Tayyab, I have talked to DSP.
[03:22] Just relax, this matter is not that serious.
[03:24] Sir, listen to me...
[03:31] Sir, yes, yes.
[03:35] But sir, warrants have been issued against him.
[03:38] Right sir. Let me release him after some formalities. Don't worry sir.
[03:50] Abdul Rehman, bring Mr. Hamza.
OK sir.
[03:59] Greeting, yes I am in police station. Yes because of Fabiha's issue.
[04:06] Don't worry, I am here and the matter is resolved. OK.
[04:12] What were you saying?
Sir, I am telling you that I am releasing him on DSP's intervention
[04:18] But we can ask him to come here if required.
[04:28] Are you alright? Didn't they beat you?
I am absolutely fine. Why are you here?
[04:32] You are in this trouble because of me.
What are you talking about. It's my duty.
[04:38] Who arranged my bail?
[04:41] Here is your wallet and mobile.
[04:44] Sir Arham
[04:46] Thank you so much.
[04:48] It's OK.
[04:51] I will never forget this favor of yours.
No problem
[04:56] OK Mr. Tayyab, thank you so much.
[04:59] Listen Hamza, I am releasing you because of him but don't be so complacent, I can ask you come here again if required.
[05:11] Bring tea.
[05:19] Come with me, I will drop both of you.
No thank you so much sir, your precious time has already been wasted because of us.
[05:26] I won't bother you anymore, we will hire cab.
[05:30] It's OK, no problem, I will drop you.
[05:33] No sir, we don't want to bother you. We will manage.
OK
[05:39] As you wish. Bye
[05:41] Thank you sir.
[05:42] Let's go Fabiha
[05:55] Greetings dad.
Greetings my child.
[06:01] You came early today.
[06:09] Do I serve lunch?
[06:12] Get ready in the evening, we have to visit Sanaya's house.
[06:16] So it means that you have decided to humiliate your wife in your sister's in-laws' house.
[06:24] Listen Somiya, if you have made a mistake then you will have to apologize as well.
[06:29] If you have already decided then kindly tell me whether I have to apologize by folding my hands in front of them or by bowing down in their feet.
[06:37] I am unable to understand that I have seen fights between sisters-in-laws
[06:46] But in this house a sister-in-law of this house is fighting against son-in-law of this house.
[06:51] It's not a big deal to apologize.
[06:54] But your sister will be happy to humiliate me in front of her in-laws.
[06:59] She is favoring her husband to appease her so you should also support your husband.
[07:30] Well done Arham, you have got account of Shah Group of Companies. Great job.
[07:37] And I hope that our client won't have any problem with our company.
[07:43] No way sir.
Good.
[07:53] Did you see his attitude? He used to confront you.
[07:57] But he was behaving very respectfully today
[07:59] But it's of no use, he will get the whole credit.
[08:02] It's his job to bring client but I was lucky that I found that client.
But you are really very lucky.
[08:09] Give me, boss has approved your loan after twenty days.
Really?
[08:17] Your problem is resolved. I am bringing coffee.
[08:25] Mom, don't cry. Pray for safe return of brother.
[08:30] I am praying for my son.
[08:34] Brother
[08:36] Hamza my son.
[08:41] What have they done to you. Why are you crying?
[08:45] Look what they have done to you.
Now stop crying, I am back.
[08:53] Everything is sorted out.
Sit.
[08:56] Why did they arrest you?
Nothing, sit here.
[09:00] What else did you want?
[09:04] Everything is alright. Stop crying, nothing has happened.
[09:08] Who arranged your bail?
[09:12] Fabiha's boss arranged my bail.
[09:16] May God bless him, he saved my son's life.
[09:21] May God fulfill all his wishes.
[09:24] Go and bring hot milk with turmeric for brother.
[09:30] Hamza tell me that why Haroon became your enemy?
[09:35] It's nothing mom, that was just a small misunderstanding.
[09:41] Misunderstanding? Does this happen because of misunderstanding?
[09:45] Hamza, tell me the truth.
[09:48] Actually, I borrowed four hundred fifty thousand rupees from him but I couldn't repay his amount on time.
What? 
[10:00] Four hundred fifty thousand rupees?
[10:04] But why did you need that much amount?
[10:08] And where is that amount?
[10:12] Actually, I just got out after taking money, snatchers snatched that money on gun point.
[10:26] What is this?
[10:30] But how will you return his amount?
Don't worry, I have talked to him. Everything will be alright.
[10:38] My child, you are only supporter of your mother and your sister.
[10:43] What else your mother can do except to get worried.
Drink this milk.
[10:53] Stop crying, I am drinking it. Everything will be alright.
[11:00] I felt as if you won't receive your mother's call as well.
[11:04] No mom, there is no such thing. You know that there are so many things to do in office so I couldn't call you
[11:10] Tell me, is everything alright?
[11:12] Do you need cash or do I transfer money in your account?
[11:18] No mom, I don't need money anymore, I got the amount from office and I have paid all dues.
[11:23] My child, I understand that Somiya's attitude was very bad.
[11:27] But that was not your mother's fault.
[11:30] If I would know that she will send your children alone like that then I wouldn't let them leave.
[11:37] I am ready to apologize to Arham as well if you want.
Mom, what are you talking about?
[11:45] Mothers are there to pray for children not to apologize.
[11:49] And you won't do that at any cost. You are my mother and no matter what others say, I have complete faith in you.
[11:55] Somiya has embarrassed me so much. What would your mother-in-law be thinking about us.
[12:01] Neither you can change thoughts of sister Somiya nor can I do that to my mother-in-law.
[12:07] And Arham's thoughts will be changed only if sister Somiya will apologize in front of my mother-in-law.
[12:12] Otherwise my life will become very tough.
[12:15] Just like sister-in-law can't go to her mother's house without brother Junaid, in the same way I can't come to your house without Arham.
[12:23] No my child
[12:24] Trust me, nothing like that will happen, everything will be alright.
[12:29] Madam, can we do some work if you are free from call.
[12:33] OK mom, I will talk to you later. Bye
[12:37] Sure
Look
[12:41] I came here to discuss that in our last project design of builders there is a difference in design and we will have to change that.
Difference?
[12:50] It is impossible.
[12:52] How is he feeling now?
[12:55] Didn't police beat him?
[12:58] No
[13:00] Well, so much has happened but no one even informed me
[13:05] Hamza's family didn't call us as well.
[13:09] Farheen, did you receive any call?
[13:12] No mom.
[13:15] I didn't receive any call.
[13:19] I was afraid that this will happen.
[13:22] Hamza was dragging this relationship somehow but now I feel that
[13:28] After truth is revealed in front of sister Nasreen, she will break this engagement.
[13:34] She won't even listen to his son this time. She won't put her son's life at stake.
[13:47] But mom, Hamza won't leave Fabiha. So, don't worry.
[13:52] Just like Haris has left you but you are not leaving him.
[13:58] Why do you mention Haris in every matter.
Because all of this has happened because of him.
[14:02] He has gone to Muscat after making our lives a hell. God will ask him and you as well.
[14:10] That cursed man has ruined our lives.
Mom, don't curse my husband.
[14:17] Farheen, if a mother's curses are effective then so much would have happened by now.
[14:25] We will handle every situation but for God's sake please stop fighting.
[14:56] Here is your cardamom tea.
[14:59] She is so irresponsible.
[15:01] Fabiha left everything undone.
[15:04] Yes, she will learn what she will see in this house. No one takes care of his/her responsibilities so how can she do that?
[15:14] She gives you food and insulin on time. Right?
Yes, she is doing better than you.
[15:24] I am also concerned about you. I obey you.
[15:31] Now let's see that how much your mother's family listens to you.
[15:39] Whether their daughter-in-law is dear to them or their daughter's in-laws.
[15:44] Or
[15:45] It's a tradition of your house that men act upon women advises.
[15:50] Tell me one thing.
[15:54] Did your mother control your father like a puppet?
[15:59] Just like you are doing to Arham and Somiya is doing to Junaid.
It's the limit mom.
[16:04] When did I do that to Arham and nor sister-in-law does that.
[16:11] I am telling you what I have seen.
[16:16] Night turned into day and morning turned into evening.
[16:22] No one came from your mother's house.
[16:27] When mother's family stops listening daughters then daughters-in-laws have to listen to in-laws. Do you understand?
[16:37] Listen
[16:42] Call Arham and ask him that where is he? He took Fabiha to police station.
[16:52] Arham has gone with Fabiha.
[16:55] Just do as I said. Don't argue.
[17:04] Huh
[17:31] I was about to call you. Where were you?
[17:33] Nothing, police arrested Fabiha's fiance Hamza.
[17:39] First I went to police station then I went to office, it was a very long day.
[17:43] Why didn't you tell me?
[17:47] That was a minor issue so I forgot to tell you.
You shouldn't have gone to police station with her. It's her own issue so she should resolve it by herself.
[17:55] We shouldn't interfere.
[17:58] What happened? I just helped a bit. Nothing more than that.
[18:03] Have you paid the loan amount?
Yes.
[18:11] My loan got approved so I called bank official and he told me about that.
[18:16] It's a same thing whether you pay that or me.
[18:20] At least you would have informed me so that I wouldn't get embarrassed like that by calling to bank official.
[18:25] We inform them who want to listen but you were not talking to me.
[18:29] And you will like your wife when her mother's family will bow in front of you. Am I right Arham?
[18:33] Maybe I must have assumed that you will appease me but no, maybe I go emotional.
[18:39] I am also assuming that you will appease me.
[18:43] Sanaya.
You are not the only one who is fulfilling responsibilities, I have also sacrificed.
[18:47] Sanaya.
I have lost my self somewhere between my children, office and responsibilities.
[18:52] At least listen to me as well.
What should I listen?
[18:55] Have you ever talked to me with a smile on your face? Do you remember that we are husband and wife.
[19:01] Have we spent some time together, do you remember that you have talked to me with a smile on your face?
[19:06] Do you know what do we discuss?
[19:09] Have you paid the bill or have you applied for loan that's it.
[19:12] We have forgotten everything and we only remember one thing, mistakes of each other.
[19:18] Arham, I only want to spent a single moment with you.
[19:23] In that moment, there is no one, no responsibility, no grievances and nothing else. Only you and me. Only me and you.
[19:34] That one moment will be enough for me to work round the clock.
[19:44] But that moment is nowhere.
[19:46] Just leave it.
Sanaya
[20:15] Just like wounds needs an ointment in the same way we need someone who loves us after we get slapped. But I don't have anyone here.
[20:24] So I will also share my grievances in front of my mother's family like Sanaya.
[20:28] Won't you listen to your husband?
[20:31] I have done that but not now.
Still your husband is talking to you.
[20:35] No
[20:37] A selfish man is talking to me, who is afraid to lose his daughter.
[20:49] I am unable to understand anything Hamza.
[20:52] Haroon won't leave me, how can I arrange such a haft amount.
[20:57] I am so embarrassed Fabiha
[21:00] I made so many big claims but to no avail.
[21:04] The amount I got by mortgaging my bike was not accepted by Haroon so I couldn't do anything.
[21:14] Sorry. I am really sorry Fabiha.
[21:19] You don't have to apologize. I am happy that you are worried about me.
[21:27] That would be great if all our problems got resolved just by mere thinking.
[21:32] When we can't do anything then leave everything on God. He is the only one who can help us.
[21:43] No doubt.
[21:46] Didn't aunt say anything after hearing the truth?
[21:51] I had to lie to her.
[21:55] You shouldn't have lied because of me.
[21:58] Her trust will be broken when the truth will be revealed.
[22:01] If I hadn't lied then perhaps I would have lost you.
[22:05] And I can't do that even if I want to.
[22:08] I can go to jail not once but a thousand times for your sake.
[22:41] There were chocolates for Hadi, have you given him?
Yes.
[22:45] And there is also Hareem's favorite cake for her.
Yes brother.
[23:10] Mom, your tea.
Thanks my child.
[23:16] Thank you.
[23:24] Arham, we are very embarrassed on the recent incident.
[23:35] And Somiya is also regretting on her action.
[23:41] I am sorry to say Junaid, have you brought Somiya forcefully here?
[23:48] It can be seen by her attitude that she is regretting by coming here.
[23:56] No aunt, you are taking it wrong.
[24:00] There is no forcefulness in the relation of husband and wife.
[24:05] And in our family there is no tradition that husband has to listen to his wife and to obey her.
[24:16] Wife can't impose her decisions on her husband. And Junaid is right.
[24:24] I apologize. I have made that mistake and I am regretting on my mistake and apologizing for that.
[24:47] Sister Somiya is talking to you. Won't you say anything in response?
[24:57] We didn't want to degrade you.
[25:02] You are also parents so you can understand that why I got so emotional for my children.
[25:10] Junaid is right that there is no harm in apologizing.
[25:16] And my honor won't get reduced if I apologize.
[25:22] So, I am sorry, once again.
[25:35] I heard everything brother. I doubted that you are hiding something from us.
[25:41] Haniya, please don't tell mom about that.
Why shouldn't I tell her?
[25:46] She should know that her son is getting punished for someone else' wrong doings.
[25:50] You went to jail today and you will have to sacrifice your life one day. Stay away from this kind of love brother.
[25:56] For God sake.
OK please. Lower your voice please. Mom can hear us.
[26:02] How long will you keep me quiet?
[26:08] Listen
[26:09] Have a little pity on your brother.
Oh really! but why doesn't she have pity on you?
[26:16] Why doesn't she have a pity on your life?
[26:19] Haniya she is very upset and I can't leave her alone in this situation
[26:27] Swear on me
[26:29] You won't say anything to mom about this matter.
[26:36] Please
[26:39] Look, I am so proud of you.
[26:43] And I am sure that you won't break my trust.
[26:48] Mom and I don't have anyone except you.
[26:52] Please brother Hamza
[27:13] You are back.
[27:16] Somiya
[27:18] Somiya
[27:22] Don't worry, she is very angry right now.
[27:26] She will be alright in a while.
[27:28] I am very happy that she took care of your love.
[27:32] May God keep your love for each other in tact.
[27:35] Ameen
[27:37] Mom, Somiya is not a bad girl but she gets emotional occasionally.
[27:42] OK, go and appease her.
[27:46] Well, this is really tough.
[27:50] No matter how angry your wife may become, few sweet words of husband cool down her anger instantly. Now go.
[27:59] Go and appease Somiya. She needs you. Get up.
[28:03] She will be appeased but
[28:07] I am worried about the misconceptions about you and Sanaya in her heart, those will be removed with great difficulty.
[28:15] Those will be removed with the passage of time.
[28:17] Go and appease your wife.
[28:19] She needs you.
[28:52] Somiya
[28:57] Somiya
[29:00] Your anger won't cool down if you will keep quiet like this.
[29:06] Somiya, I am talking to you.
What do you want to talk?
[29:10] Is there anything left to be discussed.
[29:15] By the way, does my anger make any difference to you?
[29:18] Why doesn't it make any difference? It does make difference.
[29:24] Your mother's anger makes difference to you.
Your sister's anger makes difference to you.
[29:31] But the woman who serves you round the clock she is just like a robot. Right?
[29:36] All men consider us as puppets because you have got the right of saying these three words.
[29:41] You ask them to stand, sit, cry, laugh and apologize in front of anyone whenever you want.
[29:47] It's upto you.
[29:49] But women know their rights.
[29:52] And not only men have the right to give divorce.
[29:58] Listen
[30:00] Express as much anger as you can.
[30:03] I am listening quietly.
[30:04] We express anger on those who can bear that.
You have forced me to apologize in front of them today.
[30:10] One day you will ask me to bow down in front of your brother-in-law.
What are you talking about? Why would I say that?
[30:16] You have complete right to live your life and make all your decisions.
[30:22] OK then
[30:24] You made one decision so now I will make a decision.
[30:29] I will go to mom's house tomorrow with Anaya and I will stay there for few days, months or even years but you won't say anything.
Somiya listen to me.
[30:38] Somiya listen to me please. Stop.
[30:45] I thought that you are sensible and experienced and you will handle everything and will take care of mom.
[30:49] But you proved me wrong.
[30:52] Keep your domestic problems at your home and try to focus on your job.
[30:57] I am sorry, next time that won't happen.
That shouldn't happen Fabiha
[31:01] You can't do your job like that. You have to give proper time.
[31:04] And if you don't want to do this job then tell me. I will hire someone else.
No, there is no such thing. I will be careful next time.
[31:21] Hi, Hammad, no, I won't come to office today.
[31:27] Tell madam Sanaya that Hamza is not feeling well.
[31:32] And map is on my table, give her that map please.
[31:38] OK
[32:09] Why isn't Fabiha receiving my calls?
[32:15] If someone's luck is bad then what can he do?
[32:22] We make our luck ourselves.
[32:27] Things can't change if you cry like this.
[32:32] I am so compelled that I can't see any other option.
[32:37] I can only see compulsions of my family members.
[32:43] Do you know that after a certain age girls marriage become very difficult.
[32:53] And my elder sister was going through that problem.
[32:57] And her in-laws were demanding for everything, sometime they asked about motor bike, car or going abroad.
[33:05] My uncle lives in Muscat.
[33:08] He told us that four hundred fifty thousand rupees are required to go Muscat.
[33:14] And we got agreed on this condition that brother Haris will marry sister Farheen before going to Muscat.
[33:20] The home where I used to work earlier
[33:24] Unfortunately, I took loan from Mr. Haroon.
[33:28] To arrange brother Haris travel to Muscat.
[33:32] After that he started to harass me.
[33:38] But I somehow managed to save my honor and left his house.
[33:43] And I am protecting my honor till date.
[33:50] Money is a very strange thing.
[33:53] If you have money then everyone respects you.
[33:56] And if you don't have money then you have to save your honor.
[34:01] Please pray for me.
[34:03] I would die but won't compromise on my honor.
[34:09] Poverty has been made biggest fault of man by this world.
[34:15] God has tested you with this problem so He will take you out of this as well.
[34:20] Have faith in God.
[34:23] I have faith in Him.
[34:26] So let Him do His work and you do your work.
[34:31] Right?
[34:32] Your are so nice, just like my mom.
[34:38] And you are so innocent.
[34:41] Tell me
[34:44] Didn't Sanaya say anything on going with Arham yesterday?
[34:57] Tell me, why are you quiet?
[35:01] You don't have to be afraid of anyone.
[35:05] Right?
[35:06] You will share everything with me.
[35:09] She didn't say much but she said that I should resolve my problems myself and shouldn't take help of sir Arham.
[35:19] Hmm, alright.
[35:24] Don't take Sanaya's words seriously. Right?
I am with you.
[35:30] I will take care of that. Right?
[35:33] Will you take tea?
[35:37] Yes why not. Clean this.
[35:43] Give me my phone.
Right.
[36:01] The home where I used to work earlier, I took loan from Mr. Haroon unfortunately.
[36:07] To arrange brother Haris travel to Muscat.
[36:09] After that he started to harass me.
[36:13] I somehow managed to save my honor and left that house.
[36:16] And I am still saving my honor.
[36:23] Somiya your anger is justified and I am really embarrassed.
[36:28] But this anger can be removed by discussion.
[36:32] How will we live without you? Don't leave your house.
Mom do you have any idea?
[36:37] Sanaya's mother-in-law was looking at me with such contemptuous eyes.
[36:41] As if she have succeeded in her objective and defeated me.
[36:45] Listen Somiya, unpack all these things and put these back.
Mom you should feel happy.
[36:50] That your daughter has crowned her husband today.
[36:54] And your son has humiliated his wife.
[36:58] Let's go.
[36:58] Mom, I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
[37:01] You ill mannered.
Somiya
[37:04] She has become ill mannered because of Hareem's company.
Why are you expressing your anger on her because of me.
[37:09] Children get effected because of parents' mistakes.
[37:13] Let's go.
[37:15] Somiya don't go. Put your bag down.
Why do you want to make domestic issue public.
[37:20] Domestic matter?
[37:23] You forced me to apologize in front of your sister's in-laws and you are saying that this is domestic matter.
[37:30] Just like wounds needs ointment.
[37:33] In the same way we need someone who loves us but I don't have anyone here.
[37:39] So I will share my grievances in my mom's house like Sanaya.
[37:43] Won't you listen to your husband?
I have already done that but not anymore.
[37:48] Still your husband is talking to you.
No.
[37:52] A selfish man is talking to me who is afraid to lose his daughter.
[37:58] Stop my child. Somiya.
[38:11] Junaid, stop her.
[38:14] Somiya don't do this. Somiya.
[38:17] Stop her.
Control yourself. Everything will be alright.
[38:21] She is going, stop her.
Come in, everything will be alright.
