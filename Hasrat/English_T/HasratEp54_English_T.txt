[01:18] Why don't you understand? I have told you that don't say anything in front of dad.
[01:24] If you did it again then I will kick you out of this house and I will ask dad to beat you as well.
[01:29] Then you will never forget that. Now get up.
[01:31] By the way Farheen, tell me the truth
[01:35] Why haven't you got married yet?
[01:38] Because I haven't found a guy like you.
[01:40] Well, that's right.
[01:42] And you won't get anyone like me.
[01:44] I have complete faith in my fate. Understand.
[01:46] Yes, I also have faith in your fate and you should have that faith.
[01:50] Sanaya you always said that if a person realizes his mistake then mistake doesn't remain.
But there is a difference between mistake and sin.
[02:00] You married second time, that was your mistake.
[02:05] But you broke my heart, that is your sin.
[02:10] And for that I will never ever forgive you.
[02:21] You called me Junaid.
Yes, come and sit here.
[02:29] Where were you?
[02:31] Were you with Sanaya?
[02:34] Yes.
[02:35] I wanted to condole her.
[02:39] She told me that brother Arham apologized and he wants to take her back.
[02:51] Oh I see.
[02:53] Then what does Sanaya want?
[02:57] What would she want Junaid? Her life has been ruined.
[03:05] We can only sympathize her.
[03:09] But
[03:10] Only that person knows who is going through that situation.
[03:15] I can't even bear him around me.
[03:18] I don't know how does Sanaya tolerate with him.
[03:22] A woman has to bear everything for the sake of her children.
[03:28] And she is doing the same thing.
[03:38] Hareem and Hadi neither live without brother Arham nor without Sanaya.
[03:44] I don't know what will happen to this relation.
[03:49] Yes you are right.
[03:54] I am also unable to understand that what should I do and how should I advise my sister.
[04:04] Brothers are protectors of their sisters' happiness.
[04:12] I don't want her to go back in that house again.
I don't want that as well.
[04:19] But there is not only one relationship between husband and wife
[04:26] They are also parents of their children
[04:32] And it's their responsibility to take care of their children
[04:39] I want to see Sanaya happy.
[04:44] But whenever I think about children then I start to think.
[04:53] Anyways, don't worry.
[04:58] When God has done everything this much better
[05:01] Then everything will be fine in future as well.
[05:05] Ameen
[05:09] May everything gets better
[05:14] Let me see children. I haven't seen them.
OK.
[05:31] Junaid, drink this turmeric milk.
[05:36] Your tiredness will go away.
[05:43] So many days have been passed since mom's death but we didn't realize.
[05:54] Mom went in a hurry.
[06:03] That's why I want mom to stay away from Sanaya's problems.
[06:11] I knew that she won't be able to bear that.
[06:18] You don't have any idea that mom took so much tension because of Sanaya's conflict with Arham.
[06:27] She used to cry so much.
[06:31] The same thing happened, what I feared.
[06:34] Junaid
[06:37] Don't say this in front of Sanaya.
[06:45] She is already very upset.
[06:50] She will get hurt if she will listen this.
[06:59] But mom had to go one day.
[07:08] There is no connection of Sanaya or her problems with that.
[07:21] So please don't hurt her by saying this in front of her.
[07:30] I am not blaming Sanaya. I am thinking about myself that
[07:35] I tried my best to keep her away from these problems but I couldn't do that.
[07:44] If you want to see mom happy then you just take care of Sanaya.
[07:52] Yes
[07:56] After mom, I have the responsibility to take care of Sanaya.
[08:01] I will never back off from this responsibility.
[08:09] Will you go to office tomorrow?
[08:17] Yes I will have to go tomorrow. So many days have been passed. I will go to office tomorrow.
[08:52] Mom went in a hurry. That's why I wanted to keep mom away from Sanaya's problems.
[09:02] I knew that she won't be able to bear that.
[09:06] You don't have any idea that mom took so much tension because of Sanaya's conflict with Arham. She used to cry so much.
[09:14] The same thing happened, what I feared.
[09:18] Junaid, please don't say this in front of Sanaya.
[09:24] She is already very upset.
[09:27] She will get hurt if she will listen this.
[09:38] I am not blaming Sanaya. I am thinking about myself that I tried my best to keep her away from these problems but I couldn't do that.
[09:52] If you want to see mom happy then just take care of Sanaya.
[10:00] Yes
[10:03] After mom, Sanaya is my biggest responsibility.
[12:13] What happened Hareem?
[12:20] Why are you sitting here my dear?
I am missing granny.
[12:35] Come to me.
[12:39] My dear
[12:44] We will granny for ever.
[12:52] Do you know
[12:54] Whenever our loved one leaves this world.
[12:59] Then we send them rewards in the form of our well wishes and prayers.
[13:08] Just like mom gives you gift on your birthday, just like that.
[13:15] So pray for granny's forgiveness. Right?
[13:26] Will God accept our prayers?
Of course.
[13:33] All of us should ask for forgiveness from God for our sins.
[13:38] And our Lord is so kind that He forgives us.
[13:42] But I am not feeling happy without granny.
[13:50] I am feeling suffocated here so let's go to dad's house.
[13:58] Hmm
[14:01] What if mom show you cartoon, then?
[14:10] Come on, let's go.
[14:43] But why am I feeling from your tone that you also think that all of this has happened because of me?
[14:47] Why am I seeing myself as a culprit in front of you?
[14:50] Tell me, what is that mistake? That you married me?
[14:54] I don't think there is any other mistake except this one.
[14:57] There is nothing like that Fabiha.
This is the reason Arham.
[15:03] This is right. There was no mistake of time.
[15:09] That was also my fault that I listened to you.
[16:45] Hareem, you are still watching TV.
[16:48] Aunt, please I want to watch more.
It's time to sleep, watch with Anaya in the morning.
[16:54] Please give me some more time.
No, it's to late. Go to mom's room.
[16:58] Watch with Anaya in the morning. It's too late now, go to mom's room. Good girl.
[17:15] What happened Hareem?
[17:22] You were watching TV so why have you come here?
I don't want to watch TV and I don't want to touch anything as well.
[17:29] Why?
[17:32] Did you fight with Anaya?
[17:34] Aunt didn't let me watch TV.
[17:37] It's OK my dear, look at the time, it's time to sleep.
[17:43] But you and dad never did that.
[17:49] This is not my house that's why aunt snatched remote from me.
[17:54] Don't think that way.
[17:59] Uncle and aunt love us so much.
[18:05] And they are our relatives.
[18:07] And if they stop us from doing anything then it's for our betterment.
This is not my house. I want to go to my house.
[18:14] Oho, if you will become this much angry then mom will start crying. Don't be angry. Let me tell you a story.
[18:22] You will see that uncle will kick us out of this house one day.
[18:29] Never. That will never happen. Right?
[18:33] Uncle will kick us out of this house.
[18:35] That won't happen because uncle loves us so much and he takes care of us so he won't let us go anywhere.
[18:43] He will hold us tightly like mom holds you and he will keep us with him.
[18:48] Can I show this much anger.
No, you can't do this much. Not at all.
[18:52] Because you don't look good in anger. So give me a smile. Yeah. I love you.
[18:59] Don't be angry.
This much.
Not this much. Good.
[19:08] Where are you? Don't you want to sleep. It's too late.
[19:12] I want to sleep.
[19:18] What happened? Why are you so worried?
[19:22] I am not worried, I made a mistake.
[19:26] Which mistake?
[19:31] It's too late and Hareem was watching TV and I switched off TV.
[19:39] Now she will cry in front of Sanaya.
[19:41] Then what would she think that I have started to impose restrictions.
[19:45] You did absolutely right.
[19:51] You switched off TV for her better. It's too late.
[19:54] Don't think about such minor things. Sleep.
She won't say anything but she would feel about that.
[20:02] I shouldn't have done that.
She won't feel anything. I know Sanaya.
[20:11] She will advise Hareem that why was she watching TV at this time of night. You did right. Sleep.
[20:17] What do you think, will she mind?
[20:22] Hey, why are you thinking about such a minor thing?
[20:30] Just relax. Nothing will happen. And if Sanaya showed any anger then I will talk to her. Right.
[20:39] But even then, I shouldn't have done that. I am such a fool.
[20:45] You are feeling like this because you have possessed a very kind nature.
[20:49] Sanaya won't think anything. It's too late so sleep. Lay down.
[20:55] Switch off the light as well.
[20:56] You are playing football alone.
[20:59] Yes, because Hadi is not here.
[21:05] No problem if Hadi is not here, mom is here and she will play with you.
[21:09] I want to play with dad and Hadi, I don't want to play with you.
Hareem, my dear.
[21:15] Mom is trying and I promise that Hadi will be with you very soon. OK?
[21:20] I want to talk to dad right now, right away.
[21:53] Sister, I am going to office.
Sanaya, your breakfast is ready.
[22:00] I am not feeling hungry.
[22:04] And please don't do this much for me.
[22:09] I will cook myself if need anything.
[22:14] My dear, I know that you are feeling lonely after mom's demise.
[22:24] But life doesn't stop if someone leaves us.
[22:33] And mom used to be so keen to see all of us eating breakfast together.
[22:39] So we will do that today as well. Right?
She wanted to see me happy.
[22:45] All her desires went with her.
[22:49] What happened Sanaya.
[22:54] Why are you behaving like this?
[22:57] There is no such thing sister, you are just feeling like that.
[23:02] Mom has just passed away, so maybe this is the reason.
[23:05] I feel that you have minded something.
I have forgotten everything sister.
[23:16] Good or bad.
[23:18] All because of grief of my mom.
[23:21] This grief will last for ever.
[23:28] A mother lives for her children and she dies for them.
[23:42] I killed my mother.
[23:45] Sanaya, why are you saying this?
[23:49] Brother also thinks that way.
[24:01] There is a difference between leaving house and kicked out of the house.
[24:08] Tell this to brother.
Did you hear our conversation?
[24:16] And I tried my best to correct my mistakes.
[24:26] What was lacking in fulfilling my duties and what was my mistake?
[24:33] There is only one fault that I am a woman.
[24:41] I realized that if a woman is kicked out of house by her husband
[24:50] Then she has to live her life on mercy of others.
[24:55] She has to live under pressure.
[25:02] And if a man not only kicked his wife but also his daughter out of the house and left them on the road
[25:11] There is a difference between living together and imposing yourself on other person.
[25:19] Tell me, what is my daughter's fault?
[25:26] Why should she bear all of this?
[25:32] Just because she is also a female.
[25:38] Tell me that we are preparing that girl for that
[25:46] That she will also have to face oppression from man and she will also get punished for being a woman.
[25:56] No Sanaya, why are you thinking this much?
What can I do sister?
[26:06] These thoughts never leave us.
Don't take your brother's words seriously.
[26:14] He didn't want to hurt you.
[26:20] I didn't mind brother's words.
[26:27] I am trying to get habitual to live like this.
[27:17] Fabiha, I am trying to appease you since last two days but you are not convinced.
[27:23] How long will you be angry?
Does it matter to you that how long will I be angry?
[27:31] You don't care about me.
[27:35] It's my duty to love you, take care of you and take care of Hadi and I shouldn't ask for you time in reward. Wow.
[27:48] You set yourself free from my anger by saying sorry every time but not this time.
[27:54] OK then tell me what should I do this time to appease you. I will do that.
[28:02] Nothing.
[28:05] Tell me, when will you visit doctor.
[28:09] Next week.
[28:15] OK, let's go out for dinner tonight.
[28:21] Then my night is yours, tomorrow's day is yours and all my life is yours.
[28:29] Are you happy now?
[28:37] Your promises are also like you.
[28:40] You forget everything in emotions.
[28:48] Arham, I have no grievances but I am sad that you didn't give respect to my family.
[28:55] OK sorry.
[28:59] Forgive me. And I promise that I will invite your mother.
[29:05] Everything will be fixed. I promise.
[29:10] I promise.
[29:18] I will bring them here.
[29:23] Now forgive me and give me breakfast.
[29:27] I have to get ready for office.
[29:30] I warn you if you said it again.
So give me breakfast.
[29:34] I will bring that.
[29:37] Let me get ready.
[29:40] Come on Anaya, start eating.
I will eat with grandma.
[29:46] Let me feed my dolly.
Greetings.
[29:52] Greetings, you came early.
Thank God meeting got canceled. Look at this.
[29:58] There are some strains on my shirt. Let me change this shirt.
Oh
[30:02] Let me serve lunch for you and iron your shirt as well.
What's in the lunch?
[30:06] Meat and potato.
Meat and potato.
[30:08] OK, bring lunch for me.
[30:10] Junaid, please feed Anaya, she wants to eat from grandma's hand.
[30:20] Hmm
[30:22] So now my princess will eat from dad's hand. Right?
[30:26] Come on, let me feed you.
What's in the lunch.
[30:31] Chicken with potato is my daughter's favorite meal. Right?
[30:38] Look, dad is giving you with chicken. Open your mouth. Eat it. Good girl.
[30:50] Dad will eat with you as well.
[31:01] And this is my daughter's favorite jam. Eat it. Don't eat it much else you will get diabetes.
[31:15] It's yummy.
Hmm, we need some protean as well.
[31:23] You will get good marks.
[31:24] Give me a slice.
[31:27] Are you happy now?
[31:29] Good
[31:35] Finish it quickly.
[31:44] Do you like to eat from dad's hand?
Good girl.
[32:10] How was your day today?
It was good but a bit busy.
[32:24] Where is Hareem?
[32:25] Hareem is coming. Junaid, I want to discuss something.
What's the matter?
[32:34] Sanaya heard our conversation.
[32:48] What did she say?
She didn't say anything but she was very upset. Please talk to her. She will feel relax.
[32:59] OK, I will talk to her.
[33:07] Let me give another bite to my daughter.
[33:13] So this is a very big project for us. And this one is even more bigger project than our last projects.
[33:21] So we will need support of all of you
[33:24] And I will assign this task to you. You have to maintain all files and keep following up completely. Right?
[33:33] And Shazia
[33:36] And Shazia, I am assigning this task to you that you will have to maintain an excel sheet about the followups given to you by her. Right?
[33:48] So Sanaya
[33:51] What do you want to say about this project?
[33:56] Do you want to lead this project?
[33:59] Sir, I will let you know after reading all details once again.
[34:04] Well, as you wish.
[34:08] Sophia, read this project thoroughly, maybe you will lead this project.
[34:15] So guys, meeting is over. OK.
[34:24] Sanaya
[34:27] What's the matter? You were very disturbed during the meeting today?
[34:35] I know that your mother has recently passed away and you are very upset because of that.
[34:42] But you always keep your professional life away from your personal life.
[34:50] But you looked very down today.
[34:59] I am sorry sir, everyone faces such situation in life.
[35:04] I can understand.
[35:07] Sir I have a request.
Yes, go ahead.
[35:11] Can I meet with your legal adviser?
[35:16] Yes why not, but why do you want to meet him suddenly?
[35:19] Sir I want to discuss a problem with him.
[35:26] If you may arrange a meeting with him then I will be very thankful.
Don't be so formal.
[35:33] Let me talk to Mr. Javed and I will also share his number with you. You can go there with my reference without any appointment. Right?
[35:41] Thank you sir.
[35:53] What's the matter? You are looking so happy. Have you got increment?
[35:57] Yes, I have got increment of twenty thousand rupees. So it's time to celebrate.
[36:02] Yes, it's time to celebrate and many congratulations. Give me treat for that.
[36:07] Yes why not. I promised you so treat is due on me.
[36:12] But please don't tell anyone at office because I don't want to take anyone else. This treat will only for you.
[36:19] Really? And what's unique in me?
[36:25] And If I am different from others then why?
[36:28] Well, you are my best friend that's why.
[36:40] Who is calling you?
Aunt is calling me.
[36:43] Why is mom calling you?
Let me ask her.
[36:45] Greetings aunt, is everything alright?
[36:51] Greetings, yes everything is fine. I want to discuss something very important.
[36:57] Yes aunt, please tell me.
[37:02] Farheen is showing her stubbornness for no reason.
[37:10] Shamim has just called me and she said that we should meet with that boy once.
[37:18] If she is good then nothing to worry about and Farheen will also understand.
[37:25] But me?
Yes, you should meet him and decide time and place with him.
[37:39] OK aunt.
God bless you my dear.
[37:43] Bye
[37:45] What was she saying?
Nothing, she wants to meet me.
[37:51] It's clearly written on your face that you are lying.
[37:57] Don't try to be smart and tell me what was mom saying.
[38:06] You will become angry.
[38:10] Are you afraid of my anger?
[38:13] Because you can say anything out of anger.
[38:19] Hamza that was my past. And I don't behave like that with you and I can't do that.
[38:24] Oh really? And what is the difference now which wasn't there earlier?
[38:29] Don't divert the topic. Tell me what was mom saying?
[38:35] She wants me to meet with that guy whose proposal has come for you. Aunt will act according to my opinion.
[38:46] Now you have listened. So don't be angry.
There is no need to meet with him. I am telling you.
[38:58] Mom says such things but don't take her words seriously.
[39:04] And anyway, I am taking you for a treat tonight so you won't have any time for meeting.
[39:09] Hmm, it means that we don't have any time to meet. Right?
[39:17] OK fine, I will think about it.
Forbid mom.
[39:21] OK fine.
[39:24] Let me see.
[39:46] Look, dad is giving you with chicken.
[39:53] Eat it, open your mouth.
Good girl.
[40:27] Are you playing football alone?
Yes, because Hadi is not here.
[40:36] No problem if Hadi is not here. Mom is here and she will play with you.
[40:40] I want to play with dad and Hadi. I don't want to play with you.
Hareem, my dear.
[40:46] Mom is trying and I promise that Hadi will be with you very soon.
[40:51] I want to talk to dad right now, right away.
