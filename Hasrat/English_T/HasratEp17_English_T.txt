[06:11] why mom is not opening her eyes, why she is not talking?
[06:13] compose yourself, nothing will happen to mom
[06:16] show some patience
[06:20] brother, I know that mom took a lot of tension of sister-in-law & Anaya
[06:25] she had been so worried because they had left the house
[06:29] just because, what if her son's marriage gets ruined because of her daughter's family
[06:34] I said to her many times, that let me try explaining sister-in-law but...
[06:38] she made me a stranger in just one second
[06:42] there is no fault of mom in it, I had told her not to. Ok?
[06:47] please compose yourself
[06:49] ok tell me, did you tell sister-in-law about mom's condition?
[06:54] No
[06:55] Why? Call her, I am sure she will come immediately as soon as she will get to know about mom's health
[07:00] call her, brother
[07:02] brother, please call her for my sake
[07:07] oh God, nothing shall happen to my mother
[07:19] Greetings dear parents & good evening
[07:23] as you people know that in 1965, Pakistan had a war with India
[07:29] and after many sacrifice of our army, we won the war
[07:35] So now, these beautiful little children over here will present a piece on that war
[07:43] I would like you to appreciate these kids with your claps & give them a big hand
[07:50] please our little children come here for your performance
[07:54] please clap parents, they need your appreciations
[08:32] hello, yes tell me
[08:36] where are you?
[08:38] I am sitting on the 70th floor of Burj Khalifa & drinking coffee. What's the matter, tell me
[08:42] what's wrong, brother?
Was your lunch very spicy or somebody's words have hurt you?
[08:47] Hania, tell me the matter directly. What is it?
[08:49] Mom had asked me to to remind you that we have to go to Saddar in the evening to buy aunty's clothes
[08:54] yes yes, I remember it very well and there is no need to remind me again & again
[08:58] Okay, I am sending you her number after getting it from Fabiha
[09:02] in fact, let me ask her to send you a message directly
[09:06] you won't do any such thing, just tell her directly
[09:16] We had promised Fabiha aunty
[09:19] that if she will come to our function then we'll treat her with an ice-cream
[09:24] really!
[09:25] Hadi, its late now. Also your granny is alone at home, we'll have it some other time
[09:30] please Fabiha aunty
[09:32] dear, please don't insist. Its already late
[09:34] dad, please tell her because she will listen to you
[09:38] its a father's trial, and I have to say it. Please come, the kids will become happy
[09:43] but how can we go at this time?
[09:44] since your mother had waited this much, so she'll wait for a few more minutes for the sake of the kids
[09:48] shall we go?
[09:49] yes!
[09:50] I will eat strawberry flavor
[09:53] and I will eat chocolate flavor
[09:55] and what about both of you?
[09:57] Blueberry!
[09:59] oh wow! is dad's favorite ice-cream your favorite too?
[10:03] today, Fabiha aunty will support dad instead of mom
[10:24] brother, I might have forgotten my phone inside the car. Will you please give me your phone?
[10:27] let me call Arham, he might be getting worried
[10:29] Junaid
[10:32] my child...
[10:34] dad, I won't go back
[10:36] now dad won't let you go anywhere, ok?
[10:39] what happened Junaid, what are the doctors saying? How is mom?
[10:42] they haven't said anything as of yet
[10:44] the treatment is going on, so just pray
[10:47] what happened to granny, aunty?
[10:49] my dear, nothing happened. Just pray that your granny gets well soon
[10:52] come here, my child
[11:03] don't think that I came here to mend the relations after forgetting everything
[11:13] I just came here for the sake of humanity
[11:23] doctor, what happened to mom? How is she now?
[11:26] he blood pressure was very high, but we have controlled it
[11:32] So, does she take any medicine for blood pressure?
[11:35] She takes the medicine everyday though
[11:38] she might have forgotten it today
[11:40] look, take extra care of her in this age
[11:43] and give her the medicine on time
[11:47] and keep her completely away from stress, just try that she shall not get into this condition ever
[11:53] because I think she got a minor heart attack
[12:04] but I can't say anything until the reports come
[12:08] so please, she shouldn't get into this condition next time & give her the medicine on time
[12:17] don't worry, we'll take very good care of her
[12:21] thank you, doctor
[12:30] while uniting us, one day she'll die
[12:52] thank you!
[12:55] how is the ice-cream?
[13:02] hello!
[13:03] yes Junaid, how are you?
[13:05] Arham, this is me Sanaya speaking
[13:07] Sanaya, I have been calling you since so long. You had to reach to the school for an event, and you have reached there
[13:13] I had called you so many times, Arham
also I had sent you a voice message
[13:17] but I didn't get any of your watsapp message
[13:21] It might not have been sent due to an internet issue
[13:26] mom got a minor heart attack, Arham
[13:29] I am at the hospital
[13:30] what!
[13:31] heart attack? which hospital?
[13:35] GM hospital
[13:36] okay, stay there & don't worry. I am coming, ok bye!
[13:41] okay
[13:43] what happened?
[13:44] Sanaya's mother got a heart attack, I have to go to the hospital after dropping the kids
[13:47] lets go
[13:57] start eating food, mom
[13:59] hmm...
[14:03] mom, the story Fabiha had told
[14:07] I believe that there is no truth in it
[14:11] which story?
[14:13] the one she was telling you in the morning
[14:17] my own mother couldn't give me the money, although she trusts me so...
[14:22] how can a stranger woman gives such a hefty amount
[14:25] I can't believe it
[14:28] and... whatever these eyes saw yesterday. After that, not at all
[14:37] what did you see?
[14:39] leave it mom, you don't believe me though
[14:42] hey, but tell me the matter
[14:46] mom, the man with whom Fabiha came back home last night
[14:50] I think he gave her the money
[14:53] but Fabiha goes & come back with Hamza, right?
[15:00] Hamza can only show the neighborhood alleys to Fabiha on the motor bike
[15:04] but the man with whom she came back home last night, he can show her the entire world
[15:09] and when a person's desires are welcoming her with open arms, then why not!
[15:16] Fabiha is also doing the same thing, she is roaming around with her boss
[15:21] and...
[15:22] according to me, there is nothing wrong in it
[15:37] I think I've put extra salt in it. Please check, also you didn't take the flat bread
[15:41] come on, start eating
[16:05] hello!
[16:06] yes Hamza?
[16:07] where are you Fabiha?
I've been calling you since morning
[16:09] I had gone to Hadi's school as there was a function
[16:13] its the parents duty to go to their children school. What was the need for you to go there?
[16:18] Did you go there for this work?
[16:20] the kids were insisting Hamza, since when you've started to think this way?
[16:24] anyways, I will come to pick you so don't take an auto rickshaw
[16:29] I want to talk to you
[16:30] what do you want to talk about?
[16:32] its an important matter, I will talk to you once we meet
[16:35] and yes, be ready around 6:30 pm. I will come to pick you
[16:40] Okay
[16:59] you had scared us, mom
[17:01] mom, its not as such a big matter that you've fallen sick
[17:07] a daughter-in-law cannot go to her parents house to stay there?
[17:10] you can so there thousands of times, but Somya to come back
[17:15] mom, I am not going anywhere
[17:18] I am here with you
[17:20] and you are also with us
[17:23] I want my children to stay happy
[17:27] I want the relations to be strong among them
[17:32] don't you worry aunty, we all are happy & the relations are strong
[17:35] just get well soon & take care of your health
[17:38] the secret behind my health is my children happiness, Arham
[17:45] what's the use of getting worried, mom?
[17:49] yes mom
[17:50] you shall not worry
[17:54] as it is..
[17:56] when responsibilities are shared then
[17:59] worries become easier
[18:05] what happened, mom?
[18:08] one minute, let me adjust the bed
[18:10] please raise the head part
[18:32] it would be better for you to keep your worries & your house related worries away from us
[18:37] Today, in whatever condition mom is. There is no other reason but you!
[18:44] I don't want mom's condition to worsen anymore
[18:47] and for sure, you also don't want it
[18:53] stay peacefully & let us live peacefully too
[19:00] Mom, shall I give medicine to you?
[20:14] where is Arham?
[20:16] I don't know
[20:18] he might have gone to the canteen or...
[20:23] or maybe home
[20:33] I'm sorry, brother
[20:37] you have to bear so much because of me
[20:39] you had to stay away from your daughter
[20:41] I'm sorry brother, I am really sorry
[20:44] have you gone mad?
[20:46] Why are you blaming yourself for whatever is written in fate?
[20:49] every person experiences good & bad times in their lives
[20:53] now it came into my life
[20:56] you had faced it too
[20:58] as it is...
[21:00] if a brother & sister will not support each other in bad times, then who else will?
[21:06] I think sister-in-law doesn't like that you support me or take care of me
[21:11] its not like that
[21:14] actually she doesn't like Arham
[21:17] and you are his wife...
[21:19] that's why her behavior is not good with you as well
[21:22] do I only have this relation with sister-in-law?
[21:27] even if you don't have any relation, still a person makes a relation with love or so
[21:33] yet she is your brother's wife
[21:35] give her some time with love
[21:38] she will become really good
[21:47] please call Arham, ask him where is he
[21:51] Okay
[21:54] alright
[21:55] let me call him
[22:12] he is not responding
[22:18] As far as bringing you along is concerned, I thought maybe today you'd spend some time with your mother
[22:25] I would have stayed there if you hadn't come after getting upset
[22:29] When people don't appreciate your presence, it's better for you to leave
[22:36] how can you think this way?
[22:38] please Sanaya
[22:39] I don't want to argue anymore
[22:56] Tell me Hamza, what is the matter?
[22:59] actually... how is your job going?
[23:03] its going fine, but why are you asking?
[23:06] Fabiha, I think you shouldn't have taken money from sir Arham
[23:13] Did Ma'am Sanaya talk to you about it?
[23:17] yes
[23:19] She was upset that you were being frank with Sir Arham
[23:23] being frank?
[23:25] what are you trying to say?
[23:28] you are taking it wrong, I...
[23:30] its you who is taking it wrong, Hamza
[23:32] And when did you see me getting frank with Arham?
[23:34] to go to kids school, and ask money from sir Arham. What is all this if not frankness?
[23:39] are you doubting my character, Hamza?
[23:41] I am not doubting, its not like that I am doubting you
[23:44] The way you're talking clearly shows that Ma'am Sanaya has said something to you
[23:47] She had complained to you about me, right?
[23:49] She didn't complain, she was just...
[23:52] You came here with a complaint.
[23:54] If you trusted me, you wouldn't be asking me such questions, Hamza.
[23:58] a person who trusts another person, he doesn't questions but give answers!
[24:02] And sorry to say, I have to give clarifications to you
[24:06] a relation which lacks trust isn't nurtured but dragged
[24:11] as far as frankness is concerned, then yes! I am frank
[24:15] with the kids of that house, whose responsibility is not mine but still I do care about them
[24:19] I don't get paid for it
[24:22] I am doing a favor on them
[24:24] hold it!
[24:26] I am leaving
[24:27] no Fabiha... please wait
[24:29] Fabiha wait, at least listen to me
[24:31] where are you going alone like this?
[24:33] so how else I should go, tell me?
[24:35] what's the use of such a weak relation? That you question me after listening to anyone
[24:41] when you don't trust me, then what's the use of it?
[24:44] I do trust you, I am not doubting you.
 For God sake, Fabiha
[24:49] I brought you here just to explain that you should mind your own business over there. That's it!
[24:55] I didn't know that you would mind my words so much.
[24:58] Shouldn't I mind it?
[24:59] Ok fine Fabiha, I am sorry. I am really sorry, but don't be upset like this
[25:04] I am not leaving after getting upset, Hamza
[25:07] I am leaving, carrying my shattered hopes that were once tied to you
[25:10] Fabiha, please listen to me once
[25:14] and I won't let you go alone like this, I will drop you myself
[25:18] there is no need of it, I will manage it
[25:20] Fabiha, stop it. Please leave it
[25:23] as I said, come with me
[25:33] Okay brother Junaid, I will talk to you later
[25:47] You returned from the hospital without informing me and didn't bring me along with you
[25:53] If I had stayed there for some more time, your brother's wife might have forgotten her boundaries
[25:57] Therefore, I left from there to preserve my honor
[26:00] As far as bringing you along is concerned, I thought maybe today you'd spend some time with your mother
[26:07] I would have stayed there if you hadn't come after getting upset
[26:11] When people don't appreciate your presence, it's better for you to leave
[26:19] how can you think this way?
[26:20] please Sanaya
[26:22] I don't want to argue anymore
[28:15] did you call me, mom?
[28:17] yes dear, sit down
[28:22] what's the matter? Today your way of talking is a bit different
[28:26] Fabiha look..
[28:28] I don't believe on Farheen's words
[28:31] that's why I want to know it from you
[28:34] what do you want to know?
[28:37] With whom did you come yesterday?
[28:41] actually...
[28:43] Arham came to drop me
[28:45] who Arham?
[28:48] I do the job at his house
[28:52] does Hamza knows about it?
[28:58] what will he think when he gets to know about it?
[29:05] we don't test a man
[29:08] have you forgotten your past mistakes?
[29:12] mom, the journey started from the bus stop & ended at home. That's it!
[29:17] why are you thinking too much?
there isn't any such thing
[29:19] even if I would have come via bus, still Hamza had to think that way
[29:23] A woman gives a man a chance to think
[29:26] are you getting my point?
[29:30] and...
[29:33] who gave you this amount?
[29:36] actually he gave me upon his mother's orders
[29:40] I am telling you the truth, why would I lie?
[29:43] next time, you will not come with Arham
[29:46] this was last time, Ok?
I've told you
[29:49] remember my words!
[29:52] don't worry, I will be careful next time
[29:56] Okay
[29:57] go rest now
[30:09] Hadi, its not looking good here
no, its looking good here
[30:14] Hadi, your sister is absolutely correct!
[30:16] its not looking good over here
[30:17] why didn't you come to my school function?
[30:20] all the children parents came, except mine
[30:25] I'm sorry, dear
[30:27] Fabiha aunty is better than you
[30:29] She cares about our happiness a lot, but you don't
[30:36] I had performed very well, but you missed it. I am upset with you
[30:42] I don't want to talk to you
[30:45] I'm sorry, my dear
[30:49] mom had to go to the hospital
[30:52] as your granny wasn't well, that's why
[30:55] what! What happened to granny?
[30:58] your granny has some pain in her heart
[31:02] will she be fine?
[31:03] she will become absolutely fine
[31:11] hmm...
[31:13] it seems that your anger is still not over
[31:18] alright then, tell me what punishment mom will get?
[31:22] today, you will sleep with us
[31:24] absolutely! Hadi is absolutely correct
[31:26] perfect! I will sleep for sure
[31:28] lets go
and you will tell me the story that aunt Fabiha tells us
[31:33] but mom doesn't know that story
[31:35] then how about spider man story?
[31:36] No no, tell some other like Elsa?
[31:39] No...
[31:40] Okay I will tell all the stories but first tell me how was my son's performance today? And you got first prize too. Wow!
[31:46] I am so proud of you my child
[31:50] did you enjoy?
[31:51] I had enjoyed a lot
[31:52] very good.
and what did you do today?
[31:54] I?
yes
[32:05] Fabiha, I am thinking to take all these clothes unstitched
[32:10] there must be really good tailors in Muscat, so I will get them stitched there & then
[32:13] And, this suit... I will wear this suit on uncle's dinner invitation
[32:21] why are you looking at me like this?
[32:23] won't uncle invite me on the dinner when I will go there for the first time after my marriage?
[32:26] what was the need to tell mom that I came back with Arham?
[32:30] as if mom had asked you thousands of questions
[32:33] the matter is not about questions, sister
[32:35] the way you must have told mom, I know it very well
[32:38] why are you adding poison in her mind?
[32:39] Fabiha, even I know a lot
[32:44] and what do you think, would you like to tell me?
[32:49] I am not a teenager, that I can't see or understand anything
[32:55] There isn't a map like the one you want to draw. For God sake
[32:59] Fabiha
[33:01] do you realize now
[33:03] that a person's wrong word or perception can hurt you so much
[33:12] anyways, leave it
[33:13] I've been through all this, but now I think its your turn
[33:21] Does Mom doubt my nobility?
[33:25] nobility!
[33:28] nobility can never protect a person's character, Fabiha
[33:33] look at me
[33:36] even I am innocent
[33:38] but I'm proved to be a characterless woman
[34:12] come on Fabiha, pick up the call
[34:46] why don't you get it that I don't want to talk to you, stop calling me!
[34:50] hello! Its Arham speaking
[34:56] oh!
[34:57] Sorry, I thought its Hamza calling
[35:02] No, I am sorry. I shouldn't be calling you so late night
[35:05] No no, its ok you may call
[35:09] I have scheduled an appointment for my mother with a physiotherapist & I want...
[35:15] to show her for a second opinion
[35:18] I know you do this work but...
[35:21] still, second opinion is a good thing
[35:24] I would have taken Sanaya along with me, but she has an important meeting
[35:29] So... besides, you stay with mom so
[35:33] it would be better for you to come along
[35:36] yes, ok I have no objection
[35:39] so, can you come early tomorrow?
[35:42] I will come
[35:44] Ok fine, I will pick you then
[35:46] No no, I will come myself. There is no need of it
[35:50] No, its ok. Your house is on the way to the hospital. So I will come
[35:56] there is no need of any formality, I will come directly to the hospital
[36:00] See, if you can take out one extra hour for you job then I can pick you too
[36:05] its ok
[36:15] next time, you will not come with Arham
[36:17] this was last time, Ok?
remember my words!
[36:41] where are you going so early morning?
[36:44] I have to go early today
[36:46] if you want to marry a woman, then bless them with their man (Quranic verse)
[36:51] and if you guys become compatible after fixing of proposal (Quranic verse)
[36:55] then there is no harm in it (Quranic verse)
[37:03] ok mom, I am leaving
[37:04] where are you going so early morning after getting so dressed up?
[37:07] actually, maam Sanaya's mother-in-law is not well

[39:44] I mean, sometimes a person needs to change his/her time in order to change his/her fate
[39:53] and... sometimes she needs to change her man as well
