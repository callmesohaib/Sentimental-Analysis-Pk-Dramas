[00:13] My decision is different.
[00:17] My decision is that Farheen just won't be married...
[00:23] she'll be sent away as well.
[00:28] She will go with you to Muscat...
Hadia what is happening to her!
[00:33] Are you with the patient?
Yes... what's wrong with my mother?
[00:37] She had a serious attack.
[00:42] The next twenty four hours are critical for her.
[00:45] Pray for her.
[00:52] Hadia..
[00:54] Don't worry... auntie will be fine.
[00:58] I don't need you sympathies, understand?
[01:05] Hadia...
What?
[01:07] What? Why are they here? To watch a scene?
[01:11] All of this is happening because of them. Are they here to watch my mother die?
[01:19] Hadia... this is not the time for all this.
[01:23] Besides... relatives are supposed to help one another in such moments.
I have no relationship with you.
[01:32] The ones I do have a relationship, they have become the cause for my mother's condition.
[01:39] She tried to snatch a mother of her son.
[01:45] I will not forgive you. What you did will come back to haunt you one day.
[01:50] All of this will happen to you. You will regret it.
[01:54] Mother has heard everything. My mother is in this condition because she overheard your conversation with my brother.
[01:59] Hadia silence yourself.
[02:02] Why should I be silent? Why are they here? Get out!
[02:07] Arhum... what are you doing?
[02:10] Don't you see what she's doing?
[02:14] I apologize on her behalf. She's just being emotional, that's it.
[02:19] Arhum... we can understand.
[02:57] Arhum.
[02:59] You shouldn't have raised your hand on your sister. She's married after all.
[03:04] What will she think?
[03:06] You insulted her in front of my family.
[03:10] I didn't want to do this. But it was important to show my sister her limits.
[03:15] There are other ways to do that. You slapped her in front of everyone.
[03:26] Sisters are supposed to feel secure with their brothers.
[03:29] And by slapping her you've taken that security away from her.
[03:33] What else should I have done?
[03:36] Arhum... she was upset.
[03:41] If she was upset... then you should have tried to make her feel better.
[03:48] You entangled her even more. If there are distances among relationships then that can lead to misunderstandings.
[03:56] Girls who have no father look towards their brothers for security.
[04:04] And someone who only has one brother...
[04:07] who will she go to if her only brother turns away from her?
[04:19] Talk to her and make her understand.
[04:23] Cheer her up.
[04:36] I will have my revenge tenfold for the insult I've had to endure today.
[04:45] You are proud of your relationship, right? My name isn't Hadia if I don't destroy your relationship.
[05:18] Hadia...
[05:22] My mother hasn't stopped breathing...
[05:26] and you've already started to distance yourself from me.
[05:35] Is this how brothers and sisters supposed to be?
[05:38] Are we supposed to stand in front of each other in our bad times?
[05:47] If it is like that, then I wish that I never had a brother.
[05:53] Hadia..
[05:57] forgive me... I shouldn't have raised my hand on you.
[06:04] You raised me like a father...
[06:08] you never managed to bring tears to my eyes...
[06:13] But today you laid it all to waste.
[06:19] Thank God that this is a hospital and not something that you own with your wife.
[06:26] Otherwise you would have shoved me out of this.
[06:36] Anyways... it's alright.
[06:40] I came here for two months..
[06:44] but I don't think I'll be able to manage to live two days here.
[06:47] Hadia that house still belongs to your father...
[06:54] You can live there as long as you want. No one can ask you to leave.
[06:59] Nor will they... I promise you that.
[07:05] Your promises...
[07:08] You should tell that to your wife.
[07:13] Me and my mother...
[07:17] Forget it...
[07:25] Yes doctor...
The good news is that the patient is awake.
[07:29] The bad news is that because of a serious attack, half her body has become paralyzed.
[07:36] She needs attention and care. There is a chance that physiotherapy might fix her.
[07:55] Hi... happy birthday.
[07:58] I wanted to wish you before my sister-in-law, but I'm married now and you've become second fiddle.
[08:05] Why are you lying? And if you are lying then at least put some effort into it. You forgot, didn't you?
[08:12] At least you remembered.
[08:16] The one I was waiting for hasn't wished me yet.
[08:20] Forget about that, and tell me what gift you got from her.
[08:26] It's actually a surprise... so I don't know.
[08:30] Surprise? Now don't tell me that going outside with her is a surprise, now tell me where you're going out with her.
[08:36] That is a surprise as well. I have to call a client, be right back.
[08:42] Should I make you a cup of coffee?
Yes please...
[08:46] We will eat... so that we have energy...
[08:53] Here you are.
[09:03] We will eat will our stomach are full.
[09:12] You are so strong... you do everything yourself.
[09:18] Wow!
[09:37] Hello...
[09:38] I admit that I love you more Fabiha... but that doesn't mean that you find yourself so busy that you forget about me.
[09:48] What's the matter, why are you saying such things?
That's the thing, you don't understand me, nor do you see my love.
[09:57] Nor do you care about me, if you had then you would have given importance to the things that concern me.
[10:04] Whether that be my love for you, or my birthday.
[10:10] I'm so sorry Hamza, I don't know how I forgot...
[10:14] Just don't forget me.
[10:18] Anyways... I can ignore these minor mistakes...
[10:22] but yes... I haven't forgiven you yet...
[10:27] when you will have dinner with me... I don't want to hear any excuses. So tell that to your boss.
[10:33] Alright I will...
[10:37] I'll pick you up... I'll be there by four.
[10:41] Okay done.
[10:44] Hamza...
[10:48] Happy birthday.
[10:53] I was waiting for it...
[10:56] I'll see you in the evening.
[11:00] Farewell*
[11:14] Sorry auntie... it was from home.
[11:20] Good...
[11:22] Sister... what can I say? I have been waiting for this day for ages...
[11:29] We didn't do anything because we were compelled. I told Haris...
[11:35] that once he gets his visa, I'll get him married to Farheen.
[11:40] Now sister... what date have you decided for the marriage?
[11:47] Whatever you think is right.
[11:49] The how about the sixteen of this month?
[11:55] Alright...
[11:57] Many congratulations to you.
[12:01] Where is Farheen? She should be offering us something sweet.
[12:05] I'll call her... Farheen!
[12:08] My dear Farheen...
Yes mother?
[12:11] My dear I think there are some sweet meats in the fridge, please bring them.
[12:17] Sister... I wanted to sow Farheen's dress...
[12:22] But you know we have to prepare to leave... we don't have much time.
[12:28] So...
[12:30] My dead this is some money... you can buy whatever you want.
[12:40] Bless you... and have this sweet meat.
[12:50] Here you go...
[12:53] You scared me mother...
[12:58] I'm fine Hadia...
[13:01] Nothing has happened to me.
[13:04] If something would have happened to me, then I would never have forgiven myself.
[13:11] You tried your best to kill her.
[13:20] Thank God she was saved.
[13:24] Otherwise you two had fully prepared...
[13:28] Just do me one favor...
[13:32] The hospital bill...
[13:35] you can clear it.
[13:46] Otherwise I'll be taunted for the rest of my life that my life was saved because of your wife.
[13:56] Mother, right now you need to rest. Don't worry about this, your son will pay the bill.
[14:06] If you want my mother not to be worried...
[14:10] then please go... leave mother alone.
[14:39] Thank God... sister Rafat has gained consciousness.
[14:43] Thank God...
Yes you are right. Arhum was very worried.
[14:47] But what Arhum did wasn't right...
[14:51] What he did was right.
[14:55] I was please by what he did. This how such sisters are supposed to be treated.
[15:01] That too in front of his in-laws.
No matter what, Arhum shouldn't have raised his hand on his sister
[15:08] What did he prove by raising his hand on his sister?
[15:13] I didn't sit right with me.
[15:18] Do you accept this from your brother?
What are you saying? There is a difference between Hadia and I...
[15:26] I'm not jealous of my sister-in-law, nor do I humiliate her family.
[15:30] When things are going bad people tend to change their behavior.
[15:36] No... Hadia's behavior doesn't change with time, it changes because of her mother.
[15:44] Anyways... whatever it maybe...
[15:47] It's good that brother Arhum was present there.
[15:51] Otherwise we would have been blamed for this...
[15:55] Then I'm sure he would have asked his sister-in-law to go there and apologize.
[16:01] I'll refill it.
[16:06] It tastes delicious.
[16:12] Brother Baksh...
Yes madam?
[16:16] Are you leaving?
[16:17] Madam, where can I go? Sir doesn't let me go. I'm here twenty four hours.
[16:23] I don't know what's gotten into him today, he's given me a day off, even though I didn't ask for one.
[16:27] Otherwise he doesn't let me go, even if my son is sick. I have to plead just to get an hour off.
[16:33] Do you have something for me?
I wanted to ask if he was home?
[16:38] Yes he's been here for a while. I've even served him tea.
[16:42] Alright... that's all I wanted to ask.
Should I leave then? Farewell*
[17:37] It's you... now that you're here, please lay out a shirt for me that you like.
[17:42] Pardon?
Shirt.
[18:06] Why did you come to see me?
[18:09] I wanted to go home early today.
Why?
[18:12] My mother isn't well and I need to take her to the doctor.
[18:21] I gave Pir Baksh a day off, I thought that you would cook dinner, but it's alright...
[18:27] I'll order something.
[18:31] Tell me what I should make.
Leave it... I don't want to bother you.
[18:36] It's not a bother at all. Tell me what you want to eat.
Are you sure?
[18:40] Yes...
Then make me whatever you want.
[18:46] Alright...
Thank you.
[18:58] What happened to granny?
[19:00] Nothing my dear, she isn't well... the doctor has asked her to rest.
[19:04] Muskan said that granny broke her leg.
[19:08] That she's become a cripple.
[19:11] Behave! This is no way.
[19:15] She's a child... calm down.
[19:18] Leave it... it's not the child's fault...
[19:20] She'll say what she hears. And both of your children spend time with your family.
[19:35] I've brought home cooked food for you. It's lentils, I know you like it.
[19:41] What are you trying to say? That my mother is now dependent on you.
[19:45] Are you saying that from now you'll make choices for her?
[19:49] What are you saying Hadia? I didn't mean it like that.
[19:55] Why are you putting such things in her head?
What should I say then? That you are a good woman...
[20:02] Who's away from her job to take care of her. If only you were that good.
[20:09] If I had known that you were such poisonous, I would never have let my brother marry you.
[20:18] I will take my brother away from you, remember that.
[20:26] The doctor has discharged you. Thank God it isn't something that will make us keep you here.
[20:35] I won't go back in that house.
[20:41] What do you mean?
[20:49] I've talked to my sister-in-law... we'll stay there for a few days.
[20:53] After that we'll leave for Dubai.
Don't say nonsense, mother will come with me.
[20:58] I've already talked to her.
[21:00] I don't want to fall into an argument.
[21:05] Alright then, I'll go alone.
What are you saying? You won't look nice staying with your sister-in-law.
[21:14] Will I look nice if I stay with your husband?
[21:18] Now that you're concerned about looking bad, you've changed your tone.
[21:23] Don't be stubborn. We can talk over about what happened.
[21:29] Your brother broke your pride, but don't do the same to me. Please come home with me.
[21:35] We'll talk at home.
[22:25] Hey... what did you do?
[22:30] You've burnt it..
[22:33] This is all because of me. If I hadn't asked you to stay, you wouldn't have cooked and burned your hand like this. I'm really sorry.
[22:41] No... it's an ordinary wound, I'll be alright.
[22:45] This is no ordinary... look at how burned this is...
[22:49] Let me fix this...
[22:53] I'm trying to make it better... what else?
[23:00] This is a wound...
[23:02] It won't get better by you doing nothing.
[23:05] It will get better.
[23:07] What about...
[23:09] the wound that you've inflicted on my heart?
[23:15] I don't understand.
[23:20] I have a lot of pain here.
[23:23] Look at this... feel it...
[23:27] There is so much pain here...
Let go of my hand!
[23:34] Why are you getting scared?
[23:38] There is nothing to be scared of!
[23:45] My heart has fallen for you.
[23:51] You are being rude!
[23:53] Now that you've understood that I'm being rude, I'm sure you know the reason behind it...
[24:02] Let's have a mutual understanding of this.
[24:05] I won't have to force you, because if I do then you won't be able to tolerate it...
[24:11] If I had known that you were such a foul man I would never have entered your home!
[24:16] Now that you've known that my intention aren't good... then...
Don't come near me!
[24:22] Don't touch me!
[24:27] Don't touch me...
What did I do? I'm really sorry...
[24:32] I shouldn't have done this.
Are you insane?
[24:36] I had gone insane!
Stay away!
[24:40] What was I doing? I shouldn't have done it...
[24:45] Get away!
[24:48] Fabiha!
[27:24] Fabiha... my dear... what happened?
[27:28] I'm here... tell me what happened.
[27:34] Fabiha I'm asking you something... tell me...
[27:38] He tried to force himself on me!
[28:18] Hamza...Hamza.
[28:26] No... please...
[28:31] Let's go from here...
[28:35] You can't do that.
[30:13] For this beating...
[30:15] I'll have my revenge.
[30:23] I will make you regret it...
[30:30] and that is a promise.
[30:42] Be careful..
[30:45] Mother what happened to granny?
[30:48] Nothing my dear, she's not well, the doctor has asked her to rest.
[30:52] But Muskan said that she had broke her leg and that she's a cripple now.
[30:59] Behave... this is no way!
[31:02] Arhum, she's a child, calm down.
[31:05] Leave it brother. It's not her fault, she'll only speak what she heard her elders say.
[31:11] And both of your children stay with your family.
[31:16] But Muskan told me this auntie...
My children don't lie Hadia...
[31:24] Children who are raised without parents can't distinguish between right and wrong.
[31:30] My mother is the one who doesn't say anything, otherwise you can have my mother-in-law as a grand mother as well.
[31:37] Don't argue, mother needs to rest.
[31:42] Take them away...
[31:45] Come on...
[31:52] Mother... she's a child...
[31:56] She didn't mean it that way...
She called me a cripple.
[32:01] Arhum that word has never been spoken in our home.
[32:07] Where did she learn it from?
[32:14] Curse that foul man!
[32:18] He tried to damage our honor!
[32:23] If Hamza hadn't reached there on time...
[32:28] then Lord knows what might have happened.
[32:35] Hamza... my dear...
[32:39] Not only Fabiha...
[32:42] but also I won't be able to pay you back for this.
[32:50] I didn't do you any favor auntie.
[32:55] I respected my honor.
[32:58] That was my duty...
Bless you my dear...
[33:02] Bless you.
[33:05] I never trusted that foul man...
[33:10] Why would a man...
[33:14] give four lac rupees without an ulterior motive?
[33:20] Stop crying my dear...
[33:22] Stop crying.
[34:44] Get me some water.
[34:48] Hadia!
[34:53] Hadia!
[35:43] Is mother sleeping?
[35:50] Whatever happened...
[35:52] was not good.
[35:57] I tolerated my embarrassment.
[36:02] I have only one brother...
[36:06] and I can't leave him for the world.
[36:10] But you... you are willing to leave your mother for this world.
[36:21] What should I have done?
[36:25] Is this a question?
[36:29] Ask sister to leave her job.
[36:35] This is the time to make this decision.
[36:40] You won't get back lost time and like that you won't get your parents back.
[36:48] Mother is dependent on you brother...
[36:55] Like you're his only son... Hadi is your only son as well..
[37:02] Whatever you do with your mother today, will be done to you tomorrow.
[37:12] Mother...
[37:21] Mother...
[37:27] You could have called me if you wanted something. You could have hurt yourself.
[37:33] I didn't call you once...
[37:36] I called you ten time. No one listened.
[37:42] I would have preferred dying than being dependent on my children.
[37:50] I would have accountable for my deeds then.
[37:55] Don't lose hope...
[38:00] I'm your son and I'm here with you.
[38:04] Mother we were here and we didn't hear you. No one comes on a single call.
[38:10] You could have waited...
No one will come, even if I call them ten times.
[38:15] What's with you mother? We came here as soon as we heard the glass... why won't we come if you call us?
[38:22] I'll have a bell installed tomorrow... please don't cry.
[38:29] What did you want? I was thirsty and wanted to drink water...
[38:37] Water...
[38:40] I'll give mother her medicine... ask sister-in-law to clean this broken glass.
[38:44] There are kids at home... I don't want anyone getting hurt.
[38:48] Shenaya... be careful..
[38:52] What's the matter mother?
Please have this cleaned.
[39:03] Alright don't cry...
[39:05] Please...
