[00:13] please don't worry, mom I will get a job 
[00:16] you've become so grown up now, that you'll lie to your mother on her face. Right?
[00:21] I keep telling everyone in our family that my daughter had never lied to me
[00:26] she had never let me down 
[00:28] but now, you've let me down not in front of the family only but in front of this whole world
[00:32] it was more important to reach hospital, Arham
[00:34]  Hadi is also important, Sanaya!
[00:37] we cannot loose one child for another 
[00:39] and Hareem is in this condition, because she didn't get the medicine
[00:43] medicine.. 
[00:44] So you are trying to say that my mother didn't gave the medicine to Hareem on time?
[00:47]  I haven't said this thing, but the doctor had. That Hareem got the fits because she wasn't given any medicine
[00:59] The anger was just for a night. Hareem came back from the mouth of the death
[01:03] its all due to sister-in-law's carelessness
[01:05] and brother doesn't care about his daughter at all
[01:08] because she has given the taste of her earnings to my son
[01:13] its her desire...
[01:16] but she puts the entire blame on my poor & naive son
[01:20] brother doesn't have any importance of your words too
[01:24] what about men...
[01:26] they are ready to enter the hell with their wives after leaving their paradise
[01:32] the actual task is of a woman, where do they take them
[01:36] why don't you talk to sister-in-law's family?
[01:38] what shall I talk to them?
[01:40] they will say that my son is making their daughter do the job
[01:45] So? their daughter will be the one who is being oppressed & we'll be the cruel ones
[01:49] hmm... but you should fix brother Arham's mother-in-law
[01:54] its all her doing. She teaches inappropriate things to her daughter
[01:58] and for sure, this idea of doing a job must be of her
[02:02] did she took care of our Hareem in the same manner, the way she takes care of her son's daughter?
[02:06] its very important to make brother realize this as well!
[02:10] let them come, I will ask them for sure
[02:14] yes, its important. Both mother daughter duo is making my brother a fool
[02:20] otherwise, tell me how is this possible that a son doesn't give importance to her mother?
[02:24] and a father ignores his children
[02:28] Ok mom, I am going as I have to leave for the airport at 8 PM. Ok?
[02:32] Okay
[02:35] come safely in God's protection. Come quickly
[02:39] Good bye!
[03:26] mom, mom... mom!
[03:29] Hadi
[03:31] hello my dear, how is my son?
[03:34] Hello doll... how is my daughter?
[03:37] Greetings mom, how are you?
[03:39] I'm fine, you tell me
[03:42] brother, how are you?
Greetings!
[03:43] this is for you & Hareem
[03:45] brother, what was the need for all this?
[03:47] we don't go empty hands to a sister's house. Come
[03:49] thank you!
please come, brother come...
[03:51] lets go
[03:52] you are looking so pretty, mom
[03:53] really?
[03:54] how are you feeling now?
[03:56] I am fine, was just worried about Hareem. How is she?
[04:00] where is she?
[04:01] she must be coming
[04:03] granny...
[04:07] Greetings!
[04:08] greetings aunty!
[04:11] Greetings!
[04:13] how is my dear grand daughter, my life...
[04:16] thank God, otherwise you didn't leave a chance to kill my grand daughter
[04:30] what are you saying, sister Riffat?
[04:34] All of us keep Hareem more dear than our own lives
[04:39] how can you think of it?
[04:41] you didn't give me a chance to think good
[04:44] instead of explaining your daughter, you have teamed up with her
[04:50] by the way, I have never seen such a clever woman than you Asiya
[04:59] you make your daughter-in-law serve you for day & night
[05:03] and here you've made my daughter-in-law do the job, so that she get rid of serving her mother-in-law
[05:07] right?
[05:09] mom!
[05:10] we came to inquire about well-being from a patient, sister
[05:13] as far as I remember...
[05:16] your grand daughter had never been to the hospital, right?
[05:22] as you have never shown any careless attitude towards her
[05:27] We didn't do any carelessness in Hareem's matter too
[05:31] really!
[05:33] Asiya, your words must have importance if we hadn't seen it with our own eyes
[05:41] but how will you have an idea of our pain
[05:43] you will realize the intensity of our pain, the day you'll see your grand daughter in this condition
[05:53] God forbid! What are you saying?
[05:57] aunty, I know you are worried but don't drag my daughter in all this. Please
[06:02] sister, please..
[06:05] Somya, be quiet
[06:07] Junaid, we came to see the patient here. Not to get cursed
[06:12] she should be thankful to us that we are handling her responsibilities, yet she is cursing us
[06:17] by the way aunty, you should be thankful that Sanaya is supporting your son
[06:24] if your daughter is earning, it doesn't mean that anyone can come to my house & insult me!
[06:36] I am living in my son's house
[06:39] you are standing in my house, its not your daughter's house
[06:43] if I want, I can oust you by holding your hand
[06:46] therefore, it would be better for you guys to leave from here yourself
[06:48] mom, why are you exaggerating the matter?
[06:54] I will talk to you in front of Arham
[07:04] lets go, mom
[07:05] brother, where are you going? Please don't go
[07:07] sister, listen to me. Mom, please explain them
[07:09] Sanaya...
listen to me please
[07:10] the matter shouldn't get escalated, so it would be better for you to let us go
Mom!
[07:15] mom, don't leave in anger like this. I am not liking it.
Brother, please listen to me
[07:18] Sanaya look, I'll talk to you later. We cannot talk right now
[07:23] brother actually...
[07:53] don't know why Arham is not attending the phone
[07:55] don't know what mom must be telling Arham
[07:58] hey, my dear. What happened? Come to mom
[08:03] mom, we are feeling so afraid
[08:05] Why? Why are you feeling afraid? Your mom is here with you, Come to me
[08:12] why my child is feeling afraid? My life...
[08:14] there is no need to be afraid, your mom is here with you. Ok?
[08:18] mom
[08:18] yes
[08:19] why granny (paternal) was saying such things to granny (maternal)?
[08:23] she is so nice, she takes very good care of us
[08:29] I know my dear
[08:32] maybe, granny won't come to our house ever again
[08:36] no my dear...
[08:38] she will come, why not?
[08:41] she will come to meet us
[08:43] granny (paternal) isn't good at all!
[08:45] yes mom, granny (paternal) isn't good at all
[08:47] bad manners..
[08:51] she is our elder
[08:53] don't think like this about your granny, ok?
[08:56] granny (paternal) doesn't like grandma (maternal), the way granny doesn't like you
[09:06] who said to you that granny doesn't like mom?
[09:10] because she makes your complaints to dad on daily basis
[09:13] bad manners...
[09:17] actually your mother forgets granny's works
[09:23] that's why
[09:26] granny gets a big angry
[09:31] she is our elder
[09:33] she can be angry
[09:37] she can scold as well
[09:41] but the one whom we love...
[09:45] we don't let them get upset
[09:50] and if someone gets upset, then we appease them immediately by giving them a hug
[09:58] granny is bad...
[10:00] you both will never think this again, ok?
[10:05] Okay mom
[10:07] Good!
[10:12] don't be afraid
[10:16] you don't have to be afraid at all
[10:19] your mom is with you
[10:25] always
[10:28] Somya, you shouldn't have argued with Sanaya's mother-in-law
[10:33] you know, she is habitual of saying such things
[10:36] Junaid is right, Somya
[10:38] sometimes, a person has to tolerate many bitter things
[10:42] specially of a daughter's in-laws
[10:45] its such a delicate relation, my dear
[10:47] mom, I couldn't tolerate her words for Anaya
[10:52] and you are also a mother, if anyone treats Junaid like this then will you tolerate it?
[10:57] mothers have to tolerate so much, dear
[11:03] Sanaya had to hear so much because of you
[11:06] because of me?
[11:07] then?
[11:09] what because of me, Junaid?
[11:11] everything was done by Sanaya's mother-in-law
[11:14] and Anaya is our daughter, the way I had felt bad the same way you should have felt
[11:20] so what do you think, didn't I mind?
[11:23] I had tolerated it for the sake of the relations
[11:25] when I can tolerate, then you could have tolerated too
[11:28] I haven't done anything wrong
[11:30] Stop it you both! What's done is done
[11:33] don't ruin the peace of your house, because of someone else
[11:37] mom, I am not ruining the environment but he is
[11:48] if its in parents control, then they would have bought their daughter's happiness
[11:54] oh God!
[12:06] what was the need of it? Why did you say this in front of mom?
[12:10]  I will not care about anyone, until nobody will care about me in this house
[12:14] sister, why don't you get it. Until you don't care about yourself, no other person will come to care for you
[12:21] mom is right, there is a difference in reality & dreaming
[12:25] you don't want to face the reality!
[12:28] can you leave Hamza?
[12:30] can you become distant from him?
[12:32] Can you leave your love?
[12:39] Tell me, why you're quiet now?
[12:43] Fabiha
[12:44] its very easy to give suggestions to others
[12:47] but when this suggestion is needed
[12:49] then a suggestion & the person giving the suggestion, both looks bad
[12:53] the way you are looking bad to me right now
[12:55] you think we don't care about you?
[12:58] uncle did? You had called him right?
[13:01] did he call brother Haris to Muscat?
[13:03] yes, at least we have a chance. He will call
[13:07] sister, remember my words
[13:09] only strangers solace you or give you affiance
[13:14] but only your loved ones supports you
[13:16] but our uncle isn't any stranger though
[13:26] who is it?
[13:27] uncle
[13:32] hello! uncle?
[13:35] yes, I had called you. How are you?
[14:23] mom
[14:45] mom
[14:47] I've brought lunch for you
[14:52] I don't want to eat
[14:57] you have to take insulin too, you'll fall sick if you won't eat lunch
[15:06] its a good thing
[15:08] you guys will get freedom, your life will become easy
[15:12] God forbid!
[15:16] what are you saying?
[15:21] mom, I don't understand why do you stay so suspicious from my side?
[15:27] what your family did with me today
[15:31] after that, don't hope for good from me
[15:38] you can clear the misunderstandings from Arham's heart over night, but not from my heart
[15:49] go away from here
[15:52] whatever discussion will happen, will happen in front of Arham & Hadia
[15:59] whatever you want to discuss you can, but please have lunch
[16:02] as I said, go away from here!
[16:17] mom
[16:20] mom
[16:22] mom, where are you?
[16:24] what's the matter, why are you making so noise?
[16:26] have you found some jackpot?
[16:29] mom, one shouldn't be so suspicious though
[16:32] you had been so doubtful for uncle without any reason
[16:34] Really! What as such your uncle had said?
[16:37] uncle got ready to call Haris to Muscat
[16:41] what!
[16:42] you don't believe it, right?
Even I couldn't
[16:44] but he is saying that he'll talk to Haris, also he took his phone number from me
[16:48] what does he want to talk about?
[16:49] about ticket & visa, what else?
[16:51] so who will bear this expense? The ticket, visa & stay
[16:56] passport?
[16:57] who will bear this expense?
[16:59] did you talk to uncle about the expense, or Haris will discuss it?
[17:03] mom, all of this will be done too. If Haris couldn't arrange then you can sell off my gold set that you've kept safely
[17:10] because its very important for Haris to go abroad right now
[17:13] have you gone mad? Will you waste everything n on Haris?
[17:16] mom, what are you saying?
Does all of this have any importance more than my happiness?
[17:22] mom, I am telling you. If there would be any obstacle this time then I will take my life!
[17:28] take your phone
[17:30] sister!
[17:31] God, what shall I do? How shall I explain this girl, she has gone completely mad
[17:35] mom, if uncle wants to call brother Haris in real then why are you worrying? The money will be arranged
[17:43] Right now, I am going for an interview with Hamza. Just pray that everything goes well
[17:47] Go dear, in God protection. Bye!
bye!
[17:52] this girl has made my life a living hell!
[17:56] the truth is that sister, the way my mother doesn't lie
[17:59] the same way, a mother cannot swear upon her daughter's life falsely
[18:03] Sanaya, I wasn't expecting this from you
[18:08] my mother was being insulted in front of you, and you stood there quietly & watched the spectacle
[18:15] will it be proved that I am telling the truth by swearing upon Hareem's life?
[18:18] Sanaya, I can tolerate everything but I won't tolerate if anyone puts false allegation on my mother
[18:24] Understand?
[18:55] good evening, Ms. Fabiha
[18:56] good evening, sir
[18:58] you have a 4 years experience of a care taker along with your degree, right?
[19:01] yes sir
[19:03] good!
[19:04] why did you leave your last job, and special reason?
[19:09] actually my timings couldn't match, that's why
[19:14] Okay Ms. Fabiha, we'll let you know
[19:18] ok sir
[19:31] what happened, how was it?
[19:34] Hamza, I don't think so that I will get a job
[19:37] anyways, its ok. What's the big deal if you couldn't get this job. You will get somewhere else
[19:41] there is nothing to worry about
[19:43] how come I now worry? I have to pay the rent to the landlord on the 28th
[19:47] I thought, once I will get the job so I will pay the rent somehow by taking a loan or advance
[19:51] I don't understand what to do now
[19:53] you don't have to understand anything
[19:55] I am with you, then why are you getting worried?
[19:58] I will take an advance salary tomorrow from my office, so that you can pay your house rent
[20:01] and how will you spend the next month?
[20:04] Fabiha, you are important for me
[20:07] what about time? It passes
hold it
[20:10] come sit & tell me, what would you like to eat?
[20:14] Nothing, just drop me home
[21:04] in the name of God, hey...
[21:07] hello granny!
[21:09] hey my doll...
why are you saying hello?
[21:12] greet her properly
[21:14] greetings granny!
[21:15] its ok, even hello is fine
[21:18] Sanaya...
how are you, Hadia?
[21:19] yes...
[21:21] mom, how are you?
[21:23] Hadia must be hungry, she is tired. Serve the dinner
[21:27] what tiredness in a 2 hours flight, brother?
[21:32] mom seems quite tired to me
[21:35] don't you guys take care of my mom?
[21:45] a daughter-in-law whose family taunts that her daughter is running the house expense
[21:52] then leave the existence, its such a great thing if you save your respect there
[21:56] its enough that you are seeing me alive
[22:00] otherwise, Sanaya's family didn't leave a chance today to insult me
[22:08] its a lie, Arham
[22:10] my family hasn't done any such thing
[22:12] really!
[22:15] so am I lying, Sanaya?
[22:18] what are you saying, mom?
Hadia came to our house after so many days, she will get worried
[22:25] am I worrying her?
[22:29] Ask her, ask your wife
[22:32] how her sister-in-law had insulted me, ask her what I had said
[22:39] who gave her the right to misbehave with you?
[22:44] they gave her the right, dear. Everything happened because of my daughter-in-law's encouragement
[22:51] what are you saying, mom?
Nothing as such had happened
[22:54] and you know it very well that what had happened
[22:58] how are you talking to my mom?
[23:00] you are arguing a lot in front of me, so don't know how you must be treating her in my absence
[23:07] I am realizing everything
[23:10] this is your mother's respect
[23:14] what I had said that they had insulted me a lot? Ask her, what I had said?
[23:21] mom, you had started the argument
[23:23] they just came to see the patient
[23:26] so what I had said?
[23:29] tell me, what I had said?
[23:31] I had only said that if they would have given the medicine to Hareem on the right time, then she didn't had to go to the hospital 
[23:38] That's it!
[23:40] on just a little matter, her sister-in-law had insulted your mother
[23:46] and she! She kept looking at the spectacle
[23:54] I had explained you
[23:56] I had told you not to leave your kids at your in-laws house, but you like to
[24:01] how will you leave them now?
[24:03] Sanaya, sister Somya had misbehaved with mom so much & you didn't do anything
[24:11] why are you quiet now, speak up!
[24:13] mom is telling wrong 
[24:15] what wrong mom had said?
[24:17] tell us as well
[24:21] mom has cursed them
[24:28] that Anaya shall also suffer through the same pain that Hareem had experienced
[24:37] such a big allegation!
[24:42] such a big allegation... 
[24:45] I am telling the truth, Arham
[24:47] Are you telling the truth? Then swear upon your daughter's life & say it that my mother is lying
[25:06] what shall I understand by your silence?
[25:09] swear upon her life, make us believe
[25:12] that you are telling the truth & my mother is a liar
[25:21] I won't swear upon Hareem's life
[25:23] say it that you cannot swear upon her life falsely
[25:26] think whatever you want to
[25:30] when a relation is based upon trust, then swearing upon one's life doesn't have any value
[25:40] and Arham knows it very well that I don't lie
[25:50] and I wont swear upon my daughter's life in order to prove myself correct in front of you
[25:55] why don't you accept, that a mother's conscience doesn't agree to swear upon her daughter's life falsely?
[26:01] the truth is that sister, the way my mother doesn't lie
[26:04] the same way, a mother cannot swear upon her daughter's life falsely
[26:08] Sanaya, I wasn't expecting this from you
[26:13] my mother was being insulted in front of you, and you stood there quietly & watched the spectacle
[26:20] will it be proved that I am telling the truth by swearing upon Hareem's life?
[26:23] Sanaya, I can tolerate everything but I won't tolerate if anyone puts false allegation on my mother
[26:28] understand?
[27:03] ok mom, leave it
[27:05] you know its not better for you to get angry, please sit
[27:09] sit down, please
[27:12] take the water & cool down your anger
[27:15] how can she cool down her anger?
[27:18] isn't it the matter to get angry?
[27:20] you care for your wife a lot, mom cares a lot for her
[27:24] your kids are taken care at your in-laws house
[27:27] and nobody gives her any extra work, as she is doing a job so how will she handle the house chores
[27:31] but at least she can handle my mother's honor
[27:41] I thought that I will spend some good time after coming to my parents house
[27:45] I will sit with my brother & sister-in-law, and have some good time
[27:48] I will share my griefs with my mother, ad hear her happiness
[27:53] but how would I know, that I will be wiping her tears
[27:56] Hadia look, I didn't had an idea that Sanaya will do this with mom
[28:01] because she had never misbehaved with mom
[28:04] in fact, whenever mom had been angry or upset. She never gets relieved until she appeases her
[28:12] so how can she sit peacefully today? How can she heard it easily today?
[28:15] or I shall say that she kept on pretending in front of you
[28:18] and as soon as she got a chance, she took out her heart's frustration by teaming up with her family
[28:24] Hadia, why she will do that?
[28:26] She will do this, because she doesn't have any place in her heart for my mother
[28:31] its easy to handle the responsibilities, but its very hard to handle them happily
[28:39] Hadia look, its her sister-in-law's mistake
[28:42] and we are dragging her forcefully in this matter
[28:45] the way I am feeling bad for my mother right now
[28:49] the same way, autn Asiya is also sister-in-law's mother
[28:53] and a daughter always favor her mother, whether she is wrong or so
[29:00] and sorry to say brother, such a blind trust isn't good
[29:06] when this trust will break, when your hope & honor will be tarnished
[29:11] everything will be shattered then
[29:14] and you'll be standing all alone, on the path of belief
[29:18] therefore, its better for you to make your wife realize your mother's importance instead of supporting her
[29:31] mom, I am coming
[29:45] Sanaya, I can tolerate everything but I won't tolerate if anyone puts false allegation on my mother
[29:51] understand?
[30:06] mom
[30:07] yes dear?
[30:09] what aunt had brought for us from Dubai?
[30:15] your aunt came today, she is tired
[30:18] she didn't open her bags too
[30:21] she always come like that, she never brings anything for us
[30:25] my friend Tehreem, her aunt came from London
[30:29] She had brought so many things for her, gifts.. chocolates, many other things
[30:35] when she'll ask me that what my aunt had brought for me, then what will I tell her?
[30:42] don't take such small matters to your heart, dear
[30:44] as far as gifts are concerned, then tell your friend
[30:47] that my aunt had brought so many gifts for me
[30:50] should I lie?
[30:54] you had told me not to tell a lie
[30:57] Hareem, go to sleep. You have to go to the school tomorrow & its very late. Come on
[31:03] good night!
[31:06] good night, my dear
[31:29] I am with you, then why are you getting worried?
[31:35] I will take an advance salary tomorrow from my office, so that you can pay your house rent
[31:52] a person does everything in love
[31:56] and Hamza is also doing all that for me
[32:00] I should be proud of him
[32:09] but why do I feel Hamza's sacrifices as a burden on me
[32:14] why am I always thinking of repaying his favor?
[32:19] as if he is some stranger for me
[32:50] hey, mom... 
[32:52] you could have told me, I would have come downstairs
[32:54] hey, I hadn't come upstairs since long time. So I thought to come myself
[32:59] only this milk was left, so i thought to give it to you
[33:02] be careful
sit
[33:14] drink, I have brought it for you
[33:17] I am feeling cold, mom
[33:27] what the update of your job?
[33:29] mom, they'll tell me tomorrow
[33:32] just pray that I get it
[33:37] the entire house expense is there
[33:39] there is a lot of work to be done
[33:47] Don't know mom, how far is my destination
[33:55] anyways, leave it
[33:57] tell me, did you talk to uncle about brother Haris's visa?
[34:04] he didn't call me back
[34:08] sister must have told everything to brother Haris as of yet
[34:17] let her satisfy her heart
[34:21] once she'll stumbles...
[34:25] then only she'll learn how to get a grip on herself
[34:28] then she'll understand that... 
[34:32] strangers are helpful to push down someone
[34:38] but they don't help anyone to get up
[34:41] do you know mom
[34:45] I want to run away some where very far from the life, worries & tensions of this house
[35:02] Okay
[35:05] drink your milk
[35:07] one needs energy to run
[35:23] Sanaya, I want to talk to you
[35:25] once the trust is broken then the value to give clarification becomes zero
[35:29] I am not asking you for a clarification, I am asking you something!
[35:32] whatever mom had told me, still you are favoring your family
[35:35] really! Do you think my family will do any such thing?
[35:39] why my mother will set her own daughter's house on fire, why?
[35:42] the matter is not about your mother, we are talking about your sister-in-law. She can set the fire
[35:45] why sister-in-law will do this, Arham?
[35:47] and how can I accept that my sister-in-law had taunted your mother & sister about my earning in front of me?
[35:52] however, she is handling my responsibility herself
[35:55] this!
[35:56] these sentences hurt me
[35:58] your family is handling your responsibilities, whatever you hear from them you implement it here!
[36:02] Please please Arham, there isn't any such thing.
Mom is having a misunderstanding
[36:07] mom thinks anything by herself & agrees with it
[36:12] and she has accepted it long time ago that my mother didn't gave medicine to my daughter on time. How shall I accept it?
[36:19] so, how can I accept it that my mother is lying?
[36:22] Okay... fine
[36:24] what do you want, tell me. Decide it
[36:28] I want you to come with me & apologize to my mom
[36:34] are you understanding what I am saying?
[36:36] you don't have to back out of your words
[36:39] you have to say to brother, whatever I have told you
[36:43] mom, why are you crying?
[36:46] you know, I feel so hurt whenever I see your tears
[36:51] right now I am here to wipe your tears
[36:54] who will wipe your tears, when I won't be here?
[36:57] make yourself strong, mom
[37:00] See, brother is married now. He has his own life, his wife & kids
[37:06] until when he will support you?
[37:09] now... 
[37:11] if you will do this, then how will I go back?
[37:15] you have to come with me to Dubai
[37:18] I will talk to brother today
[37:21] Hadia, mom will not go anywhere
[37:26] brother, how come mother won't go anywhere?
[37:29] look at mom's condition, something is going to happen to her
[37:33] and I don't want that anything shall happen to my mom before time
[37:39] therefore, its better for both of us that mom shall go to Dubai with me
[37:44] its good, this way sister-in-law will also get rid of this responsibility
[37:48] as I said mom will not go anywhere, so she won't go anywhere
[37:58] you know, I can't live without you
[38:03] but I am a burden on your wife
[38:08] how many more responsibilities she is going to handle?
[38:11] house, kids, job... she should handle the responsibility of a mother-in-law as well!
[38:18] its good
[38:20] she will get rid of my responsibility, then both of you shall stay happy
[38:24] its not the matter, you aren't a burden on anyone mom
[38:29] Sanaya has come to apologize to you, see...
Sanaya
[38:36] mom, children do make mistakes
[38:40] and when children realizes their mistakes then...
[38:43] its elders duty to forgive them
[38:47] won't you forgive me?
[38:51] why are you apologizing, sister?
[38:54] the one who had made the mistake, will apologize
[39:00] yes, why will you apologize since you haven't done anything wrong
[39:05] Hadia is right
[39:07] your sister-in-law had misbehaved with me, so she should apologize
[39:12] it would be fine if it was our house matter, I would have forgiven you but... 
[39:16] when I have lost my respect due to the outsiders then...
[39:22] she should apologize
[39:30] mom, let me apologize to you on behalf of my sister-in-law
[39:33] I'm sorry, please forgive me
[39:36] your sister-in-law will apologize to me
[39:39] then I will be able to live in this house with respect
[39:46] and if she says no, then there isn't any problem
[39:50] I will go with Hadia
[39:55] what's the big deal?
[39:56] you guys shall stay here
[40:00] in this house, happily...
