[00:13] I didn't kill you that day but if you won't stop bothering Fabiha then I will kill you.
[00:21] I won't get scared from your mere threats.
[00:26] You don't know about me.
[00:29] You were lucky that day that you went away safely otherwise my dogs were sufficient to take care of you.
[00:35] I don't want to eat. Take it away.
Don't argue, eat a bit.
[00:51] I hate to see your face.
[01:01] Dad. Dad.
[01:03] Dad. Dad.
[01:04] Hadi, get away.
[01:05] Don't you see, what I am doing? Stay away.
Arham
[01:12] What happened Arham? He is just a kid.
He is mine.
[01:17] I will teach him what is right and what is wrong. So you stay out of it.
[01:24] Children learn from their mistakes.
[01:27] And I made that mistake so you should express your anger on me.
[01:29] Don't force children to stay away from you out of your emotions otherwise I will be held responsible for that as well.
[01:39] Come on my child. Come with me Hareem. Come brother.
[01:54] How did she humiliate her husband in front of her brother?
[01:59] Only this had to be seen.
[02:03] Drink water.
[02:10] Hadi
[02:11] Hadi is my dear son. Don't cry.
[02:17] Dad is a bad guy.
Don't say that.
[02:20] Dad is your elder and he can scold you and he can beat you as well.
[02:24] And you know uncle that my son is a superman and superman doesn't cry.
[02:28] Do you know that when uncle was a kid then he also got scolded. I am right.
[02:35] Yes and I also got beaten.
[02:37] Do you know that uncle's dad forced uncle to pose like a cock.
So, pose like a cock.
[02:43] Shh, everyone will know about that.
[02:46] No uncle, now you will have to pose like a cock.
[02:51] No way, you are making fun of your uncle. I won't give you ice cream now.
[02:56] That won't happen, I want ice cream.
[02:59] We want ice cream.
OK. OK. OK.
[03:03] Your ice cream is in fridge. Go and eat that.
[03:07] Be careful.
[03:13] I can understand that Arham is disturbed because of aunt's condition but
[03:17] It doesn't mean that he may express his frustration on children
[03:23] But you shouldn't have interfered brother. You don't know that mom will make that a very big issue.
[03:31] She will incite Arham.
[03:34] But Sanaya, I didn't say anything wrong.
[03:38] But you will be punished anyway.
[04:03] I will never sell my jewelry for Haris at any cost.
[08:00] Farheen
[08:08] What are you doing Farheen?
[08:12] Nothing. I came here to pick my charger.
OK
[08:22] Let me bring tea for you.
[08:31] She is crazy. She puts her charger everywhere.
[08:40] But charger is here.
[08:46] Hi
[09:02] Sister
[09:10] What happened?
[09:13] Nothing.
Are you OK?
[09:19] You don't have any fever then why is your face so pale?
[09:25] Nothing Fabiha.
[09:39] I have only got today's day. Then I will sell all of these and give all money to Haris.
[09:46] Haris
[09:49] Haris
[09:51] I am in washroom.
[09:57] Come out quickly.
[09:59] This boy has bothered me so much.
[10:02] What happened?
[10:03] We have to pay seven month rent.
[10:06] Do you know about anything or it's my duty to remind you.
[10:09] Land lord called me.
[10:11] He was threatening me that he won't let us leave this house until we will pay outstanding rent.
Who has told him that we are leaving?
[10:18] I don't know that who has informed him.
[10:21] But I informed each and every person of this neighborhood that me and my son are going to Muscat for ever.
[10:29] Wow mom wow. Only this was left to be done by you.
[10:33] Do you have any idea that how much amount that will be? How can I arrange that much amount?
[10:40] You always entangle me like this.
[10:52] When will I get free from this problem?
[10:59] HI my love.
Hi Haris.
[11:03] I want to meet you.
Right now?
[11:05] We can't meet now, I have to pack my stuff.
[11:09] You are worried about your packing but you don't care about me.
[11:12] I would never ask you to meet if it was not urgent.
[11:18] Farheen, I can't meet you now. It's impossible to meet today.
[11:23] Can't you spare half an hour for me?
[11:26] OK, OK, why are you getting emotional?
[11:29] If you would care for my emotions then that would be great.
[11:36] OK fine, get ready. I will come in the evening. OK?
[11:42] OK
[11:51] Where do I hide it?
[11:56] Fabiha
[11:58] Fabiha
[11:59] Where are you?
[12:02] Have you said anything to sister?
No.
[12:08] But why is she so upset?
[12:15] She said that she has forgotten that where has she put her charger but charger is there.
[12:20] I don't know what's wrong with her.
[12:23] Anyways, just leave that. I have a good news for you.
[12:27] Which good news?
Sister Naseem called me.
[12:30] She wants to fix your marriage date with Hamza.
[12:39] Fabiha. What happened?
[12:43] You didn't listen to me. Are you listening?
[12:47] Mom, it's not about my happiness it's about my will. And I don't want to get married now.
[12:51] If you don't want to get married now but you will have to get married one day. After all you will get married.
[12:56] Mom, marriage is a very big responsibility. I have to take care of you and sister is still unmarried.
[13:02] I can't get married now. Please refuse her.
[13:04] What? I should refuse her?
[13:07] It's not a small invitation that I refuse her. It's a major thing.
[16:10] Sister, are you going somewhere?
[16:19] I am going out with Haris.
[16:24] Sister, tell me one thing.
[16:27] When will brother Haris make arrangements for you to go to Muscat?
[16:32] Why?
[16:33] What happened? Why are you asking this?
[16:36] Tell me, when will he make those arrangements?
[16:39] It can take five to six months but I don't understand that why are you asking this question?
[16:45] My marriage is impossible until you get married.
[16:49] And I have to tell this to Hamza.
[16:53] I think you don't want to get married to Hamza.
[16:55] I am afraid that your intentions are not good.
[16:58] There is no such thing. I don't want to get married now.
[17:05] I won't get old by sitting at my mother's home.
[17:08] If you want to get old then stay here.
[17:11] I am getting late, I must leave now.
[17:20] I don't know what would that innocent child feel because of Arham's treatment.
[17:25] You did absolutely right by warning Arham.
[17:30] But Sanaya feels that I shouldn't have said anything to Arham.
[17:34] They are his children and he can do anything with them, we don't have any right.
[17:36] Yes, we only have the right to take care and bring up their children.
[17:39] All other rights belong to them.
[17:42] I am really very concerned for Sanaya now.
[17:48] Somiya is right. How long will she get suffered like this on minor things.
[17:56] Until Sanaya is quiet, we should also remain silent.
[18:01] She is trying to settle in her life so let her do that. At least we can support her if we can't do anything else.
[18:11] Ask me that what do I feel?
[18:15] I can't even ask her to come here for few days.
[18:20] I can only listen her voice on phone.
It would be better for Sanaya to stay away from this house.
[18:26] And we should also refuse to take care of her children.
[18:30] If they feel something bad then they will again accuse us.
[18:33] We are already defamed so there is no need to increase that defame.
[18:38] What are you talking about Somiya.
[18:44] Don't worry, I will take you there to meet Sanaya.
Take me there my son.
[18:52] Anaya, come on, you have to go to school. So you should sleep now.
[18:57] Mom please give me some more time.
Don't argue. Come on good girl.
[19:01] Dad, please tell mom to give me some more time.
[19:05] Let her watch TV for few more minutes. Now no one will disturb my daughter. That's it.
[19:15] Let's go. You have to go to school in the morning. Don't spoil my daughter's routine like your sister. Come on good girl.
Mom please.
[19:22] My daughter is a good girl.
[19:33] I am thankful Farheen, you have resolved all my problems.
[19:37] Haris I am also very happy that the jewelry is sold for two hundred thousand rupees.
[19:42] So the problem of my visa and ticket is resolved now.
[19:46] But Haris.
[19:47] Don't do anything wrong now.
[19:49] Don't spend this money somewhere else and I become a thief.
[19:54] This money is only for my ticket and visa.
[19:56] Rather, we should apply for my visa tomorrow.
[20:02] What happened Haris.
[20:04] Why are you quiet?
How can we apply tomorrow?
[20:07] My flight is scheduled tomorrow.
[20:09] Yes but your flight is scheduled at 3 PM.
[20:12] Visa office will open at 9 AM and we will return till 1 PM.
[20:16] Don't you trust your husband a little bit.
[20:19] I can pass my whole life with this trust. Should I do that?
[20:25] Haste makes wastes. So why do you want to do that?
[20:31] You have waited for a long time so just wait for few more months.
[20:35] And don't have to worry at all. Just let me enter Muscat once.
[20:40] You will be there in the next available flight.
[20:43] And then there will be no shortage in money nor in my love.
[20:50] Listen Haris, I love you so much.
[20:55] I was living my life with a belief that you are with me.
[20:59] But I won't have that belief from tomorrow onward.
[21:05] Oh, mom is calling me.
[21:10] Hi, I am coming in ten minutes. Yes, I am coming.
[21:14] OK
[21:16] What happened?
We have to go immediately.
[21:19] At least tell me what happened?
I have to do an urgent work.
[21:31] So you knew now.
[21:33] How does a mother feel when her children are treated harshly?
[21:40] So think what does that mother feel whose son is snatched by someone.
[22:00] What are you doing?
[22:03] Let me do this.
[22:42] Arham, let me do this.
I will do that.
[22:50] Arham
[22:52] Arham
[22:59] Arham, I am telling you that I will do that
[23:02] You just humiliate me in front of your brother.
[23:04] By the way, your husband is not capable to do anything.
[23:11] I am under your favors so you can treat me just like that.
What are you talking about?
[23:16] I didn't say anything about you in front of my brother.
But you pretended like that.
[23:21] That your husband is not capable to do anything.
[23:23] You earn and manage household expenses and everything else.
[23:27] Arham please
[23:28] Don't make my words my sin.
[23:32] Otherwise it will make us to live together very difficult.
[23:39] Sanaya, for my honor only this tag is sufficient that I am husband of "Madam Sanaya".
[23:51] So let that in tact.
[24:22] Here is your ten months' rent, one hundred fifty thousand rupees.
[24:31] I gave you respite because of estate agent otherwise I would expel you after first month.
[24:42] By the way, have you got some treasure?
[24:47] You have got Muscat visa and you also paid house rent.
[24:50] What's the matter? Whom are you cheating?
[25:04] You have received your rent.
[25:08] We will leave this house tomorrow. So you can go now.
[25:13] OK, I am going.
[25:22] Tell me one thing. Which treasure have you found?
[25:27] Mom, just leave it. Just pray that there may be no other problem.
[25:33] Otherwise we will starve after we reach there.
[25:36] We were lucky. So be thankful to God.
That's right but at least tell me from where did you get so much money.
[25:47] Actually, my crazy wife sold out her mother's jewelry.
[25:54] What?
[25:57] And I am sure that she must have given you this amount for her visa and ticket which you have....
[26:13] Hey Fabiha, look at the stove.
[26:19] What are you thinking?
[26:23] Nothing. Do you need anything.
[26:26] I am your mother.
[26:28] You can lie in front of everyone but not in front of me.
[26:32] Mom you are getting worried for no reason. There is no such thing.
[26:36] Did you talk to Hamza.
[26:38] No.
[26:41] So why are you refusing to get married?
[26:43] Tell me the truth.
[26:48] Mom this is happening too soon and I have to do so many things for you and for myself.
[26:54] What does Hamza say?
[26:57] I haven't talked to him about this matter yet.
[26:59] But I will tackle him but you should understand and don't force me.
[27:18] What happened? Why is so much silence? Has anyone passed away?
[27:23] Don't say anything.
[27:24] You didn't bother to tell me before going with him.
[27:29] Oh really?
[27:31] And what about your dear daughter, who roams everywhere with Hamza?
[27:38] You trust Hamza so much but you have no trust on my husband.
[27:42] Wow, wow wow
[27:44] I am telling you that I am here for just a few more months. Once I will leave this house then I will never show my face again. I swear.
[27:54] That would be nice.
[27:57] I have listened your words.
[28:07] I talked to Fabiha's mother.
[28:10] She wants some time for marriage.
[29:11] Hi.
You are avoiding my calls.
[29:16] I am happy to know that you know me this much.
[29:21] I thought that you will call me immediately after my response.
[29:26] But this is first time that Hamza didn't call me.
[29:34] Because I didn't have the courage to hear the refusal from you.
[29:37] I didn't refuse Hamza.
[29:40] I need some time.
I want to give you time and love Fabiha.
[29:45] With complete rights.
[29:47] Try to understand Hamza. Who will understand except you.
[29:53] And when will you understand me Fabiha.
[29:56] I am afraid of losing you.
[30:02] I will be free from this scare if you will live with me.
[30:06] But then it will be very difficult for a daughter to fulfill her responsibilities about her mother.
[30:13] I am not only thinking about myself Hamza.
[30:16] I have to take care of two more persons and you know about that.
[30:21] It is impossible until sister get married.
[30:26] OK then, I won't insist until Farheen's marriage.
[30:29] But once she will go to Muscat then I won't listen a single word from you.
[30:37] And as far as the responsibility of aunt is concerned, just leave that on me.
[30:46] Tell me that didn't Haroon bother you again?
[30:52] No
[30:55] I have planned to handle this matter.
[30:57] You don't have to worry, he won't bother you again.
[31:18] Hi
[31:20] Yes
[31:21] This bank representative. You have been called to inform you that this month you will have to pay yearly payment along with this month's payment
[31:33] OK
[31:35] Tell me, how much is that amount?
[31:39] Sir, it's five hundred fifty thousand.
OK.
[31:47] I will pay this amount as soon as possible.
[31:51] And the last date is 30th December.
[31:55] OK
[32:22] Sanaya, we have to pay balloon payment of house and children yearly fee as well.
[33:11] So now you knew.
[33:13] How does a mother feel when someone treats her child harshly.
[33:20] So think, what would that mother feel whose son is snatched by someone else.
[33:29] Mom, you have limited your thinking that I have snatched Arham from you.
[33:35] There is nothing like this at all. I can't even do that if I may like to do that.
[33:39] If you don't believe me then at least you should have believed your upbringing.
[33:43] If a man becomes blind in love then he can't see anything and I don't know what magic have you done to my son.
[34:00] Mom
[34:02] Mom, I am not that bad.
[34:05] The way you are thinking about me.
[34:10] I don't even want to see your face.
[34:15] But I don't know why do you come in front of me to tease me.
[34:22] You are doing very wrong mom. Very wrong.
[34:26] It's not less than a sin to accuse someone else for no reason.
Just go.
[34:32] It would be better to repent in front of God for your sins before you may get punishment.
[34:37] You have snatched son from a mother.
[34:42] You can be held accountable for that anytime.
[34:46] And you will have to give justification for your sins.
[34:49] Mom, say whatever you want to say but please don't forget to eat that porridge.
[35:12] Who is there?
[35:13] Fabiha
[35:15] Fabiha, maybe Hamza is at the gate.
[35:21] I don't know where she is. Let me open the gate.
[35:36] Where are you going early morning?
[35:39] I have an interview today.
[35:41] Didn't you get that job, which was recommended by Hamza?
[35:48] Actually
[35:51] I have decided to find an office job.
[35:57] After spending so much money in doing caretaker course now you will work in office?
[36:02] Just leave it and tell me what is the time of brother Haris' flight?
[36:07] At 3 PM.
[36:09] Listen Fabiha, go by bus today.
[36:13] I will go to airport with Hamza. As you know that it is very important for me to go there.
[36:16] Hamza will agree if you will ask him. I don't know whether he will agree if I will ask him.
[36:22] I will ask Hamza to take you there.
[36:25] OK, I will be ready.
[36:29] Good bye.
[36:36] Mom, I am going for the interview.
[36:46] Hi
[36:55] Fabiha you are still standing here.
[37:01] Hi
[37:06] Listen, we are a gentle family and everyone respects us in this neighborhood.
[37:15] So don't spoil our honor.
[37:18] You are very sensible. Kindly teach some sensibility to your daughter as well.
[37:25] I am like your mother and this..
This? This is for my safety. I haven't brought it to scare you. Just think
[37:36] The girl who has men behind her then it is difficult to fight against her.
[37:44] My daughter is not like those girls.
And I am not like those as well.
[37:55] I am sorry. Everyone will seem as he is.
[38:02] Listen, stop bothering us. I will return all your amount.
[38:07] But I am not here to take my money back.
[38:10] I am here to make a deal.
Deal?
[38:17] Your daughter has made a fraud of four hundred fifty thousand rupees.
[38:21] So the deal will be done for your daughters.
[38:30] So make your decision.
[38:36] Younger one
[38:40] Or the elder one.
[38:44] I have no connection with this matter.
[38:48] You are so mean.
[38:51] Your sister sacrificed for you and you saved yourself very easily.
[38:58] This is wrong. This is very bad.
[39:01] Now she is in trouble then you will have to give sacrifice for her.
[39:08] What rubbish?
[39:13] I am saying what you are listening.
[39:17] Listen, give us one month's time, I will return your whole amount.
[39:22] If you will keep harassing us like this then we will be forced to take legal help.
You want to take legal help.
[39:30] For that there should be a proper case. Let's go with me.
Stop.
[39:36] If anyone move forward then..
Go back. Go back.
[39:47] Don't get scared. I forbade you that don't get scared.
