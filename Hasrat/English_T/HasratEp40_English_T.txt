[01:53] My loved ones have placed the chains of society's fear and tantrums on my feet, Mom
[01:58] I cannot let myself free from these chains, even if I want to
[02:04] why?
[02:06] because my mother had to answer her extended family
[02:10] my brother's expenses will increase
[02:13] When a man can set a woman free by pronouncing three words of divorce and declaring that she is characterless
[02:21] then why a woman doesn't have this right, mom?
[02:28] doesn't a woman have any self-respect, mom?
[02:38] why a woman is liable for everything?
[02:42] What's the matter, Sanaya? Did anything happen at your house?
[02:46] I am unable to do it, mom
[02:51] mom...
[02:57] I feel so suffocated
[03:01] it feels as if...
[03:03] I can't breathe, I will die mom
please handle me
[03:11] I will talk to you later
[03:15] oh God!
[03:24] aren't you afraid?
[03:27] about what?
[03:30] what if I go away from you
[03:36] Mister, I completely trust my love. Also I am so proud of it
[03:44] And I will never break your pride
[04:43] what are you looking at?
[04:45] saree suits you a lot
[04:50] I won't be able to digest your false compliments
[04:53] but women loves false compliments a lot
[04:57] I don't get flatter, Mr. Arham
[05:00] so what do you like?
I will say, whatever you want me to
[05:05] A woman doesn't need anything else except her husband's love, not even false compliments
[05:11] and my love is yours
[05:15] and you have a right on it
[05:18] and I don't keep anyone's right
[05:20] Will you specify all the rights today, or will we go to dinner?
[05:25] lets go
[05:42] What are these two doing here?
[05:50] Hadi, Hareem... you guys haven't got ready as of yet?
[05:53] Mom has forbidden us to go
[05:58] She scolded us as well and told us not to talk to Fabiha Aunty
[06:05] let me talk to Sanaya
[06:07] leave it
[06:09] mom is bad, I won't talk to mom
[06:13] Hadi...
Hadi!
[06:15] Hadi, dear listen to me
[06:27] anyways, lets go
[06:30] Sanaya is at home, she'll look after the kids
[07:01] Hadi, open the door
[07:04] Hadi
Hadi...
[07:06] let me bring the keys, you shall stay here. Ok?
[07:10] Hadi, open the door
[07:13] Hadi!
[07:16] Hadi
[07:17] Hadi
Hadi...
[07:19] mom, where is Hadi?
[07:21] Hadi!
Hadi...
[07:23] Hadi
[07:26] Hadi
[07:27] Hadi
[07:37] Hadi, what happened?
[07:40] Hadi, my dear...
stay with your brother, I am coming in a while ok?
[07:44] Okay...
Hadi, come lets play hide & seek
[07:47] No, I don't want to play
[07:48] why you don't want to play?
[08:21] Even if she likes, so what? What is her mistake in it?
[08:26] as I am so handsome
[09:15] Fine! if Hadi doesn't want to play hide & seek then see what mom had brought
[09:21] ice cream!...
yaay
[09:26] I wanted to go with dad
[09:31] Why didn't you let me go? 
Call Dad right away and ask him to come home
[09:37] my dear, you have to go to the school in the morning that's why mom didn't let you go
[09:41] you didn't let me go because of Fabiha aunty, right?
You are a bad mom
[09:45] Hadi!
[09:47] Hadi! Listen to me
[09:51] take it dear
[09:53] eat your ice cream, let me check on your brother
[10:04] what's the matter, Fabiha? What are you thinking?
[10:09] that you've done such a big favor on me by coming into my life
[10:18] You gave me support, although you had your own family
[10:22] I don't know where I would have gone if you had refused to give me respect
[10:30] Fabiha, refusal happens when the heart doesn't agree
[10:38] and every moment spent with you is very important for me
[10:45] since you came into my life
[10:48] life has become so joyful
[10:54] my mom was happy
[10:57] the children were happy, Sanaya's entire stress was gone
[11:03] Everything became so good as soon as you came in
[11:07] but you got into a problem because of me
[11:10] No Fabiha
[11:12] It's not your fault, but this heart wanted to be cared for by someone
[11:16] and then you came into my life
[11:20] Won't you leave me in the middle of nowhere by blaming my love for you?
[11:24] it will never happen, Fabiha
[11:27] I will always stay with you
[11:35] I have only one distress
[11:42] that my mother is not with me anymore
[13:26] Sir, we are from the recovery department. According to the bank's orders, we have to repossess your car
[13:30] what do you mean by this?
[13:32] Can't you see that I am with my wife, is this some appropriate way?
[13:34] I'm sorry, sir, but it's our duty. You are not responding to any bank calls or providing us with any updates
[13:39] we are compelled to take this step
[13:41] See, I will go to the bank tomorrow and talk to them. Please leave for now
[13:44] You will get your car back once the amount is deposited in the bank
[13:49] you need to leave this car for now
[13:51] Usama, ask the madam to come out of the car
[13:53] hey!
[13:53] don't you dare!
[13:56] she is my wife. You want the car right?
take it
[14:02] come Fabiha
[14:09] you want the car, right?
 now sit
[14:27] If they wanted to recover the car, they should have come to our house or your office. How did they find out about our location?
[14:32] maybe because of the tracker
[14:35] Arham, all of this is happening because of Sanaya
[14:38] If she had helped you, we wouldn't be getting humiliated on the road like this
[14:43] anyways, lets go home now. I will look into this matter later
[14:48] come...
auto!
[15:11] what happened mom, you haven't slept as of yet
[15:15] I don't feel sleepy
[15:17] since I have talked to Sanaya
[15:20] I am feeling so anxious
[15:22] don't know how my daughter must be
[15:24] Mom, Sanaya is absolutely fine
[15:27] If you worry like this, you know you'll fall sick
[15:32] she is not fine
[15:37] After talking to her, I fear that she might do something to herself out of depression
[15:49] Why?
[15:51] what as such she had said?
[15:52] whether she says anything or not, but I am her mother
[16:00] I do have an idea of her pain & sorrow
[16:04] Okay
[16:05] don't you worry. I will take you to Sanaya tomorrow
[16:09] promise?
[16:10] Okay, now rest. Go to sleep
[16:14] hurry up
[16:15] Okay, good night
[16:58] what are you looking at?
[17:00] Sanaya's new car?
[17:07] Your car used to be parked next to it
[17:10] On which you used to pick up and drop Sanaya, and do all her work. You were basically her driver
[17:20] now she got her own car
[17:22] now she won't be needing a driver, right?
[17:28] but today, when you need her the most then you are getting humiliated on the roads
[17:37] Arham, if she had cared for you a little, she would have been with you today
[17:45] Arham, there's no use in standing here and looking at your unfulfilled desires
[17:50] lets go inside
[18:20] he is your husband & its your duty to support your husband in bad times
[18:25] he is your husband as well, so you also have some duties
[18:29] Earlier, Arham and you used to divide the house utility expenses equally
[18:33] so why it cannot be done now?
[18:36] because now you've come
[18:41] Arham lost his car because of your stone-hearted attitude
[18:44] you must be more upset than him
[18:46] because your desires are left unfulfilled, right?
[18:55] As it is...
[18:59] a woman should stay happy in her husband's stature
[19:02] and I can't see you happy at all
[19:09] Sorry to say...
[19:11] Arham sacrificed so much for you; he gave up many things for you
[19:15] You have had to tolerate a lot and make many sacrifices, maybe Arham as well
[19:20] he is only mine!
[19:26] he didn't stayed mine, then how come he will be yours?
[19:35] my patience won't get wasted, Fabiha
[19:47] move away
[20:51] what happened Junaid, you seem a bit worried. Is everything alright?
[20:58] I am worried about mom
[21:00] why, what happened to mom?
[21:03] she is quite worried about Sanaya
[21:07] do one thing
[21:08] stay with mom for an entire day
[21:12] try to divert her mind a bit
[21:15] by the way Junaid, shall I say something?
[21:17] She is a mother
[21:19] she will obviously get worried
[21:21] I am tensed, what if she gets sick by taking Sanaya's tension
[21:27] she is taking too much of her tension
[21:29] Okay, don't take tension. I will take very good care of her
[21:34] ok do one thing
[21:36] Be ready in the evening. We'll go to Sanaya's house; maybe Mom will feel better after meeting her
[21:43] okay
[21:46] okay, give me the breakfast as I am getting late for office. Hurry up
[22:02] Sanaya
[22:07] Sanaya, can you please drop me to my office?
[22:09] Why, where is your car?
[22:11] I will get it back within a few days, I don't have it now
[22:14] You will get it within a few days, so you'll manage. Its just fine, as you are a man
[22:17] why will you need me?
[22:19] Sanaya, my office is on your office way. Please
[22:22] but our paths have been changed long time ago, Arham
[22:33] you had complaints with my fate
[22:35] and now you've entered Fabiha in your life
[22:38] so tolerate it
[22:40] so, you won't drop me to my office?
[22:44] I would have dropped you for sure
[22:45] I would have given you this favor for sure
[22:48] if I wasn't getting late for my office
[22:50] Sorry
[23:14] hey, but you were going to the office with Sanaya
[23:17] why did you come back?
[23:19] Arham
[23:21] what happened?
[23:23] did something happened?
[23:25] tell me something
[23:42] that girl will be very lucky who will enter Hamza's life
[23:47] why can't I be that lucky girl?
[23:50] but Hamza loves Fabiha
[23:54] he used to love her
[23:56] he used to love her
[23:58] but now it has become a part of his past
[24:00] and what will you do about your age?
[24:02] people will make fun of you, also you are a divorcee
[24:06] Why?
[24:07] where its written, that only a man can be older in a husband & a wife's relation
[24:13] Can't a divorced girl get another chance to live her life?
[24:18] think about it
[24:20] Hamza have suffered a lot in his journey of love
[24:38] yes
[24:40] I will become an ointment for Hamza's wounds
[24:44] what wrong am I doing?
[24:56] ok mom...
[24:58] I am leaving, see you in the evening
[25:00] one minute...
[25:03] why are you so dressed up?
[25:07] what's wrong with you, mom?
I am not very well dressed up
[25:09] dear look...
[25:11] a face is one's heart's mirror
[25:19] and then I am your mother, so don't lie to me
[25:24] what's the good news?
[25:34] Mom, they have discussed our salary appraisals for this month
[25:38] that's why maybe I will also get a chance
[25:41] Okay
[25:43] Fine...
hey! listen
[25:46] If you talk to Hamza, ask him what he has decided about marriage
[26:08] do talk to him
[26:37] what are you looking at?
[26:42] Nothing... 
shall we go?
[27:22] Arham, I have been asking you since so long that what happened but you aren't answering
[27:27] tell me something, what happened
[27:31] she didn't bothered to take me along with her
[27:34] this is what happened with me
[27:35] I think, I have never done anything in this house. I have not done anything in my life ever. I don't stand anywhere
[27:40] I couldn't do anything
[27:42] I don't have a car to go to my office
[27:51] first of all drink water
[27:57] Arham, its not possible that years long love & affection shall fade away
[28:07] And you were so proud of this weak relation
[28:16] Ma'am, Sanaya didn't fulfill her love for you, and you are still keeping this relation intact
[28:24] Arham, the reality is that she had never loved you
[28:30] aunty was absolutely correct that Sanaya maam is a selfish & opportunist person!
[28:37] She took advantage of your love, and you kept becoming the bad guy in front of her while seeking her love
[28:43] And she kept moving forward in her life freely, while you kept supporting her
[28:50] when you needed her help, then what did you get in return?
[28:53] aunty's hatred & separation?
[28:58] Arham, she always kept you under her favors, labeling her freedom as hard work and struggle
[29:09] When you fall in love with someone, you can forgive not only their mistakes but also their sins
[29:14] therefore, you should remove this matter from your heart that its your mistake. You have done nothing
[29:24] you have to take a stand
[29:25] for me, for yourself, for our future. I am also your responsibility
[29:33] come here
[29:37] you must have saved something for the future
[29:40] any plot, bond... anything
[29:44] yes, I do have a plot
[29:47] then use it, its our right. We don't need any favor from Sanaya
[29:57] Okay?
[30:02] and don't worry, everything will be fine
[30:59] hello sir, how are you?
[31:01] yes sir
[31:03] Sir, I have emailed you all the details.
So what's your opinion?
[31:08] good morning, sir!
good morning!
[31:11] good morning!
Hasn't Arham come yet?
[31:13] No sir
[31:15] send him to my room once he is here
ok sir
[31:23] where were you? Boss is very angry, he had called you inside his room
[31:28] what is she saying?
[31:29] he is so angry, go meet him. Give me your bag
[31:40] sir, did you call me?
[31:41] yes, come in Mr. Arham
[31:44] this is for you
[31:47] Sir, what is this?
[31:49] this is a warning letter
[31:53] You have been marked late almost 15 to 16 times this month, without any prior information
[32:00] Arham, if you continue with this attitude, how will we achieve this year's targets?
[32:04] it won't work this way
[32:07] Sir, I am really sorry sir. I will be careful next time
[32:10] it would be better, Arham
[32:13] just now you've lost the car, soon you can loose your job too
[32:19] this is not a government office
[32:21] It's a bank, and it has specific opening and closing times
[32:25] I understand sir, I am really sorry
[32:28] it would be much better for you to make efforts instead of saying sorry
[32:31] you may go now, please
[32:34] ok sir
[32:49] come in
[32:51] be careful
[32:53] hello!
[32:56] how was your day?
[32:57] very nice
really?
[32:59] mom, the principal has called you & dad tomorrow for the parents teachers meeting
[33:05] okay
[33:08] and from the next week, our final exams are starting
[33:13] Okay, mom will get all the preparations done & like every year both of my children will do the top
[33:18] yes!
[33:20] so tell me, who will eat the chocolate?
[33:23] I will eat
[33:24] and Hadi?
[33:26] No, I don't want to eat
[33:27] if he won't eat, then I will eat it
[33:29] ok fine! if Hadi won't eat it then lets cancel our next week plan of watching a spider man movie
[33:39] spiderman movie?
[33:42] give it to your brother
ok take it
[33:44] ok lets do one thing
[33:47] lets go
shall we go?
[33:49] we'll watch the Barbie movie too
[33:50] okay, lets go
[33:56] Greetings sister!
[33:59] Greetings! How are you Fabiha?
[34:02] I am fine, how about you? how is mom?
[34:06] mom is absolutely fine
[34:07] leave these things & tell me, where did you go for your honeymoon?
[34:13] nowhere
[34:15] why?
[34:16] I called you, thinking that you might have gone on your honeymoon with Arham
[34:20] I was thinking, you might be in Switzerland or in Canada
[34:32] what happened, where are you lost? Why are you quiet?
[34:37] nothing, just today Arham was asking me that where we shall go for our honeymoon
[34:41] Fabiha
[34:43] your desires are standing in front of you with an open arms
[34:48] and you are asking them to wait, instead of hugging them
[34:54] are you mad? If Arham is saying then go. Go & explore the world
[34:58] this was your desire, right?
now fulfill your desires
[35:07] I will talk to you later
[35:12] Fabiha, listen to me
[35:18] Okay fine, we'll talk later. Bye!
[35:23] Sorry Hamza, I was talking to Fabiha after so many days so...
is it the time to leave?
[35:29] Farheen, how is Fabiha?
[35:34] she is very happy, she was telling me that Arham is taking her on the honeymoon
[35:38] first they'll go to Switzerland then to Canada, they have planned such a long tour
[35:52] Hamza, shall I say one thing?
[35:57] See, whenever I talk to Fabiha
[36:01] I never feel that she regret about anything
[36:06] and here you are. You are stilling mourning for her
[36:09] Please, come out of this grief
[36:15] Farheen, this life is there due to the grief
[36:18] if there is no grief, then I won't be able to live
[36:22] there isn't any such thing
[36:24] I think, you have locked yourself in this box forcefully
[36:27] and you've written the word "LIFE" on that box with bold labels
[36:30] what else shall I do then, tell me?
Look around yourself, Hamza
[36:35] life is nearby you
[36:38] its just that you need to extend your hand to it
[36:42] it will hold your hand, it will handle you
[36:48] it will take you out of every grief
[36:51] I... 
[37:03] let me bring my bag
[37:45] you seem quite tired today
[37:47] was the work load very much?
[37:49] yes, there is an assignment in the office & the deadline is nearby
[37:53] that's why there is so much of work load
[37:59] you must be thinking, since you came into my life there is only problems & issues
[38:08] You didn't get anything you deserved
[38:14] what about me, Arham
[38:16] Even before, I used to live according to my desires, so I will continue to do so now as well
[38:20] I just don't want to worry you
[38:23] I promise you Fabiha that I will fulfill all of your desires
[38:26] your companionship is more important for me than any desire
[38:30] I had all the hopes from Sanaya
[38:33] but she didn't supported me
[38:37] by supporting me in those difficult times, you have made a place in my heart & in this house
[38:43] But now, you might be thinking that I am nothing without Sanaya
[38:49] its not like that, Arham
[38:51] Sanaya has put this inferiority complex in your heart & mind
[38:56] and you've started to consider yourself weak by believing it
[39:01] a well earning woman makes a man weaker
