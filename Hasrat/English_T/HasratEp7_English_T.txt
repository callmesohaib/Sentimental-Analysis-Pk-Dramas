[00:13] Sister, which date will be suitable in your opinion?
You can fix as per your convenience.
[00:20] So what about 16th of this month?
[00:25] What happened to grandma?
[00:27] Nothing my child. She is not feeling well so doctor has advised her to take rest.
[00:31] But Muskan told me that grandma's leg is broken and she has become lame.
[00:38] Hareem, behave. This is not right way to talk.
[00:41] Arham, she is just a child. Relax.
[00:44] Just leave it brother. It's not children fault.
[00:47] They will say what they listen from their elders.
[00:50] And both your children spend whole day in their granny's house.
[00:54] So they will talk like this.
[01:16] Hamza didn't eat anything. Go and see him.
[01:22] He is very concerned about you.
[01:26] Console him.
[01:34] How can I do that if I am not comfortable.
[01:38] But you are with him.
[01:41] And if you are with each other then you try to forget even the biggest of griefs.
[01:49] He loves you so much and respects you as well.
[01:55] Appreciate his love my child.
[01:58] Do you know, he will feel so relax if your console him?
[02:08] Otherwise he won't be able to sleep whole night.
[02:14] Go
[02:17] Got and meet him.
[02:44] What do you think that I am relaxing here?
[02:49] Mom is bed ridden, sister-in-law has refused to fulfill her responsibilities whereas brother
[02:56] If brother had taken care of mom then she wouldn't be in this condition.
[02:59] So who is left to take care of mom, it's me.
[03:04] And you that how difficult it is to take care of any patient.
[03:08] It's very difficult.
[03:10] I thought about coming here and spend good time and relax but no
[03:16] I am not destined to live peacefully.
[03:20] I didn't know that I will have to hold such a big responsibility.
She is your mother Hadia.
[03:25] And now it's your and Arham's duty to take care of her in this situation.
[03:29] Really? So it's not my duty to serve your mother. Why do I hold that responsibility?
OK
[03:36] Do whatever you want, it's useless to advise you.
[03:41] OK fine, then I am coming back.
[03:54] Hey, you are here. I was about to leave.
[04:00] I will be concerned about you.
[04:04] I am fine Hamza, no need to worry.
[04:09] OK, then swear on my head.
[04:14] You should believe my words more than any swear.
[04:21] I will take support of swear if I will lie in front of you.
[04:27] Then I will pray to God, that day may never come in our lives when you will have to swear on my head.
[04:36] I am sorry that your birthday got spoiled because of me and you couldn't celebrate.
[04:40] What are you talking about Fabiha, I can sacrifice thousands of birthdays like this for you.
[04:48] Oh yes
[04:52] I brought this flower for you.
[04:55] It's not fresh but
[04:58] It's fragrance is still there.
[05:02] It's rose, don't think it's jasmine.
[05:07] I am your lover, don't consider me lover of your friend.
[05:18] Just keep smiling like this.
[05:20] Don't lose this smile. Just keep it there.
[05:25] Just keep it.
[05:27] What are you doing?
It's my birthday's gift. Smile.
[05:31] Just like that.
[05:33] Let's take a picture.
[05:45] Thank you.
[05:49] Fabiha, I can do anything for you. I can fight against whole world, I can make you laugh whole day and can become a joker for you but I can't see fear and tears in your eyes.
[06:09] I must leave now.
[06:11] Bye
[07:09] It's a nice dress.
[07:14] It's Haris's choice.
[07:18] But no one likes Haris in this house.
[07:23] Today I have realized after seeing mom's longing for Hamza.
[07:32] But Fabiha, Haris also loves me as much as Hamza loves you.
[07:41] Why do you think like this, there is no difference between you and me.
[07:46] But mom differentiates between us.
[07:52] Hamza has saved her daughter's honor.
[07:55] But
[07:57] This can't feed you.
[08:00] Money is essential to live a good life.
[08:03] We can buy anything if we have money, even we can buy happiness as well.
[08:09] Anyways
[08:11] There is not much difference between Hamza and Haris.
[08:13] Hamza isn't earning in millions that he will provide you all luxuries after marriage.
[08:18] You will also have to live in a small house after marriage.
[08:25] And Haris is elder son-in-law of this house.
[08:31] He should get more respect than Hamza but no
[08:36] Your fiance Hamza, who has an ordinary job, mom gives her more importance.
[08:42] Sister why are you thinking like this?
[08:46] You are getting happiness after so much difficulty so you should welcome that.
[08:55] Your Nikah is scheduled for tomorrow so you should be prepared for that.
[08:59] So should I celebrate alone. Tell mom that you are not her only daughter, I am also her daughter.
[09:15] Just leave everything and tell me that why didn't you put henna on your hands?
[09:31] Greetings mom, how are you?
Greetings, how are you my dear.
[09:36] And how is your mother-in-law feeling now?
[09:39] Just think that your daughter's responsibilities have been increased.
[09:44] It's God's will my dear.
[09:48] I couldn't even tell Arham in this tension that I have got promoted.
[09:56] Mom, I will talk to you later.
[10:00] Bye
[10:28] Are you worried?
[10:34] I am in deep trouble.
[10:40] At one side there are necessities of life and on the other hand my mother.
[10:45] I don't understand what should I do.
[10:48] Arham
[10:50] Don't worry.
[10:53] This bad time will pass.
[11:02] My mother may not go with this bad time.
God forbid.
[11:08] What are you talking about? Nothing will happen to mom.
[11:16] Sanaya, mom needs to be taken care.
[11:23] One of us will have to quit job.
[11:29] One will have to quit job.
[11:32] Do you know, what it means?
[11:36] Arham, we will have to leave this house and will have to change our children school.
[11:43] And we can't afford that.
[11:50] I forgot to tell you in this tension.
[11:57] I got promotion and I have got an increment.
[12:03] Arham
[12:06] We are slowly and gradually nearing our destination.
[12:09] What if we changed our path?
[12:15] Please think about our children future.
[12:25] So should I leave my mother?
[12:27] Should I leave my mother for my children future?
No, I am not saying that.
[12:34] But we can find a solution to this problem.
[12:38] And we will arrange a caretaker for her.
[12:45] And before that we will take care of mom during alternate days.
[12:49] Everything will be fine.
[12:52] Do you know any caretaker?
[12:55] Yes, I will talk to a boy in my office.
[13:06] I am worried about my mother.
[13:17] Hi
[13:20] Haven't you slept as yet?
[13:23] No, how about your pain?
[13:27] This pain will heal with the passage of time.
[13:31] But how do I tackle this restlessness which is bothering me.
[13:35] Fabiha, you had to go through this trouble in my presence.
[13:40] Nothing has happened because of you Hamza. Why are you in this guilt?
[13:45] There are no claims in love, there are promises and
[13:49] I want to fulfill all my promises.
[13:52] At least give me chance.
But why Hamza? These are my problems.
[13:58] Why do you treat me as stranger?
[14:00] And that is the case then I have decided.
[14:05] That we will also get married after sister Farheen's marriage.
[14:10] Marriage?
Yes, marriage.
[14:25] Hadia
[14:29] Hadia
[14:33] Hadia
[14:34] Yes mom.
[14:37] Give me water.
[14:40] I am thirsty.
[14:44] Oho
[14:47] Mom, is this the right time to drink water.
[15:09] Wait a second
[15:11] Be careful.
[15:17] Oh, what are you doing mom?
[15:34] Lay down.
[15:42] Are you OK?
[15:46] Mom, couldn't you bear that thirst for some time?
[15:49] I was sleeping soundly.
[15:52] I was in a deep sleep and you spoiled my sleep.
[15:57] Why are you wasting your good deed Hadia?
[16:02] It's a very good deed to serve your mother.
[16:05] Mom, it's not about good deed, it's about taking care of others.
[16:10] Who will do your work after my departure.
[16:14] Your daughter-in-law is useless.
[16:18] Do you need anything from me?
[16:21] That's it.
[16:22] Do I switch off the light?
[16:26] Don't ask me to do anything again.
[16:47] So this is our bedroom. The area from bedroom to TV lounge, the corridor in the center.
[16:53] You called me.
Yes, please come in.
[16:58] Let's discuss later.
Sure, I am going to make tea. Will you take that?
Please.
[17:03] Thank you. Sit.
[17:08] Hamza, once you discussed about a caretaker with me.
[17:12] I need her urgently. Can you please arrange that caretaker for me?
[17:15] Yes why not madam?
[17:17] Actually, she is my fiance.
[17:19] And she is very experienced in this field and she handles all kind of patients.
[17:24] That's great, if she is your fiance then she will be trustworthy as well.
[17:27] And I don't want to hire anyone through any agency.
[17:30] So when will you bring her?
[17:32] As per your convenience.
[17:35] So, bring her at my residence.
[17:37] You have my address, we will discuss remaining matters in front of Arham.
[17:40] OK madam, let me call her and ask about her consent. Then I will tell you.
[17:44] Sure
[17:50] It's really bad, sister-in-law didn't change her attitude.
[17:55] Even though I have advised brother so much last night but to no avail.
No one cares about you.
[18:06] No problem my child.
[18:08] No matter if anyone cares for me or not, my daughter is worried about me.
[18:15] But
[18:16] I will leave shortly. Who will take care of you after my departure?
[18:23] Why?
[18:25] You will stay here with me for a month and a half.
[18:29] One and a half month, I don't want to stay here for two more days.
[18:34] I asked Sameer and he has booked a flight for me. I will leave tomorrow.
[18:45] Tomorrow?
[18:51] Your mother is bedridden so you are leaving me in this situation?
No mom, what are you talking about.
[18:59] Tell me, can I stay here after getting that much humiliation?
[19:06] Daughters visit their mothers' house to get comfort.
[19:09] And I am getting this comfort.
[19:15] Mom, I have brought hot soup for you.
[19:22] Brother I am going back tomorrow. I am concerned about mom.
[19:28] She can't travel in this condition and how will she live alone at home?
[19:32] Don't worry, Sanaya is arranging a caretaker.
[19:36] So my mother will be taken care by maids?
[19:38] Hadia there is a difference between a maid and a caretaker.
[19:42] There is no difference.
[19:43] They treat patients in a very bad way.
[19:45] You don't know about that and by the way both of you don't stay at home whole day.
[19:48] How would you know that mom has got her food and medicine or not?
[19:54] Her life will be shortened to half.
Don't worry.
[20:00] Sanaya has talked to a boy in her office and that girl is trustworthy and she will take care of her.
[20:07] Your wife has told you so it's over.
[20:11] Mom drink soup, lest your sugar level gets low.
[20:18] What is dowry amount?
[20:21] Sister what do you say? It's around fifty one thousand.
[20:26] What is your opinion?
[20:29] Five hundred thousand rupees.
[20:34] Five hundred thousand rupees
[20:35] What are you talking about sister? Talk about marrying your daughter.
[20:40] Aunt, if you feel that dowry amount is your daughter's guarantee then you are thinking wrong.
[20:46] Nikah is more important than dowry amount.
[20:55] Mom, did you talk to Sanaya?
Yes, I talked to Sanaya.
[21:00] So what have they decided?
[21:02] I mean that aunt's condition is not good so that they can leave her alone.
[21:08] Arham and Sanaya will have to think about their jobs.
[21:13] If they will quit jobs then there problems will increase.
[21:16] There will more problems.
[21:21] So what do you mean mom?
[21:24] We will also have to take care of her mother-in-law along with her children.
[21:27] I didn't say anything like that.
[21:31] But your words meant that mom.
[21:34] What they did to us, after that we should refuse to hold responsibility of their children as well.
[21:40] I can't say anything like this to Arham.
[21:44] Learn to maintain relationships my child.
[21:52] Mom is right.
[22:11] I have decided as well that we will also get married after sister Farheen's marriage.
[22:17] How do I tell Hamza that I don't want to get married now.
[22:21] I don't know what will he think.
Fabiha, look at my henna.
[22:26] Fabiha, what are you doing?
[22:29] You were about to burn my wedding dress? What were you thinking?
[22:31] It was just like that.
[22:35] Listen
[22:37] If you will keep busy in your thoughts then you won't be able to make decisions for your future.
[22:42] Just forget what happened to you.
[22:48] Are you worried because of yesterday's incident or anything else?
[22:51] Has Hamza said anything to you? Is he doubting you?
No sister, there is nothing like that.
[22:56] I was thinking that when you will leave then who will fight with us.
[23:01] Really?
[23:02] You will miss my fights, not me.
[23:06] We miss those persons who go away from us.
[23:16] Who is calling?
Hamza
[23:31] Do you think that I should go there?
[23:33] Yes, there is nothing to afraid.
[23:36] In fact, I am very happy.
[23:39] If you will work in that house then I will be content and you don't have to worry.
[23:44] Do you know, madam is very sweet and very straight forward and trustworthy.
[23:48] And I haven't met with her husband but I am sure he must be a very nice person.
[23:52] They have two children and both of them go to their jobs. It's a complete family.
[23:58] Will you take me there?
[24:01] Actually, I am very busy in office today. Hire cab.
[24:10] OK
[24:11] Let me share location with you.
[24:14] OK
[24:16] OK bye
[24:19] Hamza called you.
[24:22] What did he say?
[24:25] He was talking about my job.
[24:28] Haris's mother called me, they will arrive at 7 PM.
[24:32] Ask Hamza, when will Qazi come?
[24:36] OK
[24:49] Welcome.
[24:54] Meet her, she is mother-in-law (to be) of Fabiha.
[25:00] Oh nice.
[25:02] You are looking so beautiful.
Hamza come here.
[25:07] He is Hamza.
Greetings
[25:09] He is my younger son-in-law (to be)
[25:11] But he is like a son to me.
[25:15] Oh son.
[25:18] But elder son-in-law is more than son.
[25:22] Why are you sitting here, you should sit there. Hamza take him there.
Yes go there.
[25:47] Wow, the bride is so beautiful. Sister Farheen, you look so beautiful.
[25:52] Recite some verses upon you.
[25:54] Thanks
[25:56] Hania, ask your brother to marry my younger sister.
[26:02] If he even heard this conversation then he will ask this Qazi to arrange his Nikah.
[26:08] I don't want to marry right now. Please spare me.
[26:15] Hania.
I am coming. Get ready, I am coming.
[26:20] Show me.
[26:24] There is something lacking.
What's that?
[26:27] Let me see this.
[26:30] I will tell you.
[26:34] We will have to protect you from evil sight.
[26:43] You are looking so beautiful. You were waiting for this day. Right?
Now we will spend it very happily.
[26:52] Where is your jewelry?
[26:59] What is dowry amount?
[27:04] Sister what do you say? It's around fifty one thousand.
[27:08] What is your opinion?
[27:12] Five hundred thousand rupees.
[27:16] Five thousand rupees?
[27:17] What are you talking about sister? Think about marrying your daughter.
[27:23] Aunt, if you feel that dowry amount is your daughter's guarantee then you are thinking wrong.
[27:28] Nikah has more importance than dowry amount.
[27:33] He is absolutely right.
[27:35] Sister, what else do you want except to marry your daughter peacefully.
[27:41] If you have given that much importance to your daughter's choice then you should also give us some respite.
[27:47] It's OK aunt, no problem.
[27:57] Qazi sahab
[27:59] Write fifty one thousand as dowry amount.
[28:15] I am not in a mood to get marry now.
[28:18] I have to fulfill so many responsibilities.
[28:22] Don't sacrifice your happiness in fulfilling responsibilities.
[28:25] And you should handover some responsibilities on Hamza's shoulders.
[28:29] If you will keep fulfilling necessities then he will be used to take advantage of your job.
[28:33] And as far as mom's responsibility is concerned, let Haris get job in Muscat then both of us will manage that together.
[28:42] Are you getting my point?
[28:58] Are you ready?
Qazi sahab is coming.
[29:07] Fabiha help me.
[29:27] By the grace of God, you are looking so beautiful.
[29:34] I always wished that you get married as soon as possible.
[29:44] But you know
[29:47] I am very restless.
[29:50] Mom
[29:53] Mom's prayers can change fate.
[29:56] And I want to change my fate.
[29:59] My heart is filled with your love.
[30:04] What do you think
[30:06] That I am strict with you
[30:09] No, I love you so much.
[30:18] Whenever I have scolded you, that was for your betterment.
[30:25] I pray that may God give you lots of happiness. God bless you always.
[30:33] May God give you my age.
[30:37] You have become bride today
[30:39] You will become mother one day.
[30:43] Then you will realize about my love for you.
[31:29] What magic have you done to brother
[31:32] That he is more concerned for his wife's job than his bedridden mother.
[31:37] If you want to live happily in your house then you should take care of your in-laws' house and leave to worry about your mother's house.
[31:44] Just like you are doing.
[31:47] I don't need anyone's advises to settle in my in-laws' house.
[31:51] I will do whatever I feel right.
[31:53] I don't want my mother to become dependent on a caretaker.
You are wrong.
[31:59] You don't like that you sister-in-law go to work and your brother lives peacefully.
[32:05] And we live happily in this house.
[32:08] So it would be better for you to go back.
[32:12] And by the way, married girls look good in their house, I mean in their in-laws' house.
[32:21] And listen, please switch off light.
[32:25] Our electricity bill is very high.
[32:28] And I have to pay that.
[33:57] It's a good opportunity, Qazi is also here and both of us are convinced as well.
[34:03] So what do you think? Should we make that happen?
[34:08] I have shoe and curses, so what do you think, should I do that?
[34:15] Groom is here and it's also a marriage function so what do you think about congratulating them?
She is absolutely right.
[34:25] Please
[36:02] Our Nikah is done, I pray for early receipt of visa as well.
[36:06] It is said that man's fate is made because of woman's fate.
[36:11] And I am sure that my fate is very good.
[36:15] Just pray that no more hindrance will be there.
God willing.
[36:34] Hi Miss Fabiha, how are you? I am Haroon. You have run away by taking my four hundred and fifty thousand rupees.
[36:42] It's obvious that I am not your boss so there is no dedication from your side.
[36:49] So how will you payback my loan. Choice is yours.
[36:59] In terms of cash or....?
[37:14] Poor girl got scared.
[37:17] That's really bad Haroon.
[37:28] What happened Fabiha? Why are you so scared? Who called you?
[37:37] Tell me, why have you become a statue? Who called you?
[37:43] Tell me, who called you?
Haroon called me.
[37:50] Haroon, what was he saying?
[37:58] He wants to get his money back. He was threatening me.
[38:01] Will you ask Haris to give you that money back. He has spent all that amount.
[38:10] No sister, don't worry, I won't ask brother Haris to give me money.
[38:19] So what will you do then?
[38:21] I am unable to understand anything.
[38:29] Tell Hamza about it.
[38:33] No
[38:35] I want to keep Hamza away from this matter.
[38:39] Fabiha listen to me, you don't have any job nor you have any treasure that you can give that to Haroon.
[38:47] Being a man, Hamza would have known so many ways to sort out this issue. He is your future life partner.
[38:54] I will decide how to payback Haroon's amount not Hamza.
[38:58] You can't do anything alone. Why don't you understand?
[39:02] Listen to me.
[39:04] Hamza's craziness has scared me.
[39:07] I don't know what will he do if I told him about this matter. I can't tell him.
