[00:13] Take a look.
[00:16] This is how girls are supposed to be? Willing to let go their happiness for the happiness of others.
[00:27] Sometimes it's good to let go of one's happiness for others...
Mother...
[00:36] I told you not to come home with this man. Did you understand?
[00:42] You lied to me in the morning as well. Does Hamza know that you went to the hospital in the morning?
[00:52] Did you tell him or not?
No.
[00:55] Really... so you lied and made a fool out of your mother.
[01:06] Sofia, can you postpone the meeting with Mr. Sikander?
[01:09] I'll be in a little late today. Please take care of it.
[01:13] Okay, bye
[02:00] Mother... could you help me with my tie.
I'll be right there my dear.
[02:10] Yes my dear... your tie is supposed to be here.
[02:13] How many times have I told you that you're old enough to do this yourself.
[02:19] Is your bag ready?
[02:22] Let me check.
[02:26] Your geometry box isn't here. Where is it?
[02:30] Auntie Fabiha would know?
Why would she? To whom does the geometry box belong to?
[02:35] It's yours, right? Then you should know.
[02:38] Mother... you give her money to take care of us and granny, right?
[02:42] Then whose responsibility is it? Auntie Fabiha, right?
[02:50] Mother here's my geometry box, you know nothing.
[02:59] Let's go mother.... father must be waiting for us at the breakfast table.
[03:03] Let's go Hadi.
[03:18] Mother...
[03:40] Mother.
[03:47] I'm leaving.
[03:55] Mother, are you upset?
Why would I be upset?
[03:59] What right do I have over you? I tried to explain things to Farheen, she didn't listen. I tried explaining things to you, you didn't understand.
[04:06] But now I understand and I'm not upset.
Sit down and listen to me.
[04:11] I admit that I made a mistake. I shouldn't have hid things from you.
[04:16] But if I had told you the truth, you wouldn't have let me go.
[04:19] Mother, I had already told Arhum.
You only care about Arhum...
[04:24] but you don't care about your honor and your mother's word, right?
[04:30] He is the one who is maintaining our honor, he did us a favor, how can you forget that?
[04:37] Haroon gave you the money as well, was he trustworthy?
[04:42] Money can't buy trust, understand?
[04:45] Listen to me, Arhum is an honorable man.
Stating so doesn't make a man honorable.
[04:51] Be smart about it Fabiha... don't trust blindly again.
[04:55] I'm not being blind, I'm just trying to repay the favor.
[05:00] If you want to return the favor, pay them back with money not your honor.
Alright fine, I'll do as you say!
[05:09] I've made a decision about your life.
[05:13] If you want to convince your mother, then move your life forwards.
[05:56] Why did you try to act smart in front of mother? If you didn't know anything, you should have said so in front of mother...
[06:01] But I saved you.
You made me look like the bad guy in front of mother...
[06:09] I never understood you women... I stood by you and you're scolding me.
I don't want you to stand by me like this.
[06:18] It seems that your mother scolded you a lot today. You're so angry.
[06:25] Do you remember that today's dinner is with me, right?
I do.
[06:29] Okay.
[06:36] Mother, I need to check your sugar.
Fabiha will check in once she arrives. Go and prepare for work.
[06:47] Fabiha can insert the insulin.
No!
[06:52] She's the one who will check the sugar as well. Go...
[06:58] Why aren't you ready for work?
[07:01] I decided to spend time with the family, and go to work a little late.
That's why morning seems so special today.
[07:09] I'll bring tea for you.
[07:14] My dear... eat slowly. I can't breathe watching you eat so fast.
[07:21] Sure mother.
[07:29] Thank you so much. It's been a while since I've had your coffee.
[07:35] Do you remember that you didn't go to work without drinking my coffee.
[07:39] Yes, and your coffee still tastes the same.
[07:50] Mother, do you want something?
When will Fabiha be here?
[08:02] Start eating.
[08:07] Coming!
[08:14] Yes?
Is this miss Farheen's house?
[08:18] This is your courier.
[08:22] Haris must have sent me tickets from Muscat...
[08:25] Sign here.
[08:34] Mother... mother...
[08:39] Mother where are you? Come outside!
What's all the noise?
[08:44] Mother look at this... Haris sent me the ticket to Muscat.
[08:49] He sent you a ticket? Are you sure?
[08:52] I told you that Haris loved me...
[08:57] Forget about six months, he couldn't live without me for four months. Do you believe me now?
[09:03] Thank God Haris started using his brain. This is great.
[09:10] Haris is so nice, you should have no suspicion now.
I believe you. Haris turned out to be an honest man.
[09:18] He's very nice, are you happy now?
I'm very happy!
[09:24] To tell you the truth, I didn't expect you to be so happy for me.
[09:28] My dear... both of you are my children. I want both of my children to be happy.
[09:35] I can't believe, I want to dance!
[09:39] Open this up and see the dates on the tickets.
Oh yes! I didn't check the dates of the tickets.
[10:13] Farheen... what's the matter?
[10:20] Farheen? Show me...
[10:35] What's this?
[11:06] What has happened?
[11:10] Farheen, everything is over. I told you...
[11:15] That man isn't trustworthy.
[11:20] What face will I show the world and my family?
[11:26] What will I say?
[11:29] My child...
[11:34] Farheen.
[11:39] Farheen.
[11:41] Farheen.
[11:43] My dear.
[11:45] Don't worry.
[11:49] God will make everything better.
[11:55] This cannot be.
[12:02] Haris...
[12:07] Farheen...
[12:16] Who are you making this coffee for?
For Arhum.
[12:20] He drinks it before work. I was late today, but I'll make it two minutes.
[12:28] Arhum has already had his coffee.
[12:32] The kids are off to school, and mother's breakfast is ready. Insert the insulin to mother and server her breakfast.
[12:38] The rest I'll take care of, just look after mother.
[12:42] I'm really sorry you had to do everything yourself. Hamza was late today and there was a lot of traffic, that's why I couldn't make it on time.
[12:49] I wasn't late because of you.
[12:54] I'm going late because I want to. Before you came I was taking care of these responsibilities myself.
[13:01] Responsibilities that have been handed to you in return of money.
[13:10] These are my duties and I'm just fulfilling them.
[13:17] Exactly how you're taking care of me and providing for your home.
[13:59] Divorce?
[14:03] This cannot be.
[14:06] Haris cannot divorce me.
[14:10] Haris cannot divorce me.
[14:12] He cannot do this.
Farheen, what's the matter?
[14:16] What are you doing?
What did Haris do to me?
[14:19] What did he do? He ruined my life!
[14:23] What did he do? I've been ruined! My life is over!
[14:26] Leave me... let me be! Everything is over!
[14:35] What should I do?
[14:39] What should I do?
[14:41] Here is your juice.
[14:45] Hold this...
Thank you.
[14:51] The phone is ringing.
[14:56] Yes mother...
Fabiha come home quickly.
[14:59] What's the matter, is everything alright?
[15:03] What's that noise behind you? What's going on?
[15:06] This is not the time to talk, come home quickly.
[15:10] I'm coming.
[15:15] My life is ruined... I will ruin everything.
Be strong my dear!
[15:22] What has happened? Haris was supposed to call me to Muscat...
[15:28] I did my packing... my clothes... my shoes...
[15:32] Everything was inside my suitcase... what has happened?
[15:36] What should I do? Will I not go to Muscat now? Haris has divorced me.
[15:41] You will stay here.
I fought for my happiness.
[15:46] Everything is over my dear...
Come to your senses...
[15:50] Come to you senses...
I've come to my senses now... I revolted against you for this relationship.
[15:58] What did I get for it? Haris divorced me!
[16:04] He has labeled my a divorcee!
[16:08] No mother... it's better if I die.
[16:12] Farheen listen to me!
[16:18] Hamza, pick up the phone.
[16:21] What's the matter? Why are you worried?
Mother called, she sounded very worried.
[16:28] I need to go home right now.
Sure go ahead.
[16:31] Hamza is not picking up.
[16:32] Ask Arhum to drop you.
[16:35] No... I can go on my own.
How can you? You don't know what happened, and you need a man.
[16:42] Go and call Arhum, I'll ask him to drop you. Go and call him.
[16:48] Go ahead...
[16:59] What's the matter? Why aren't you at work today? Won't you be late?
[17:04] It's nothing... I was waiting for a meeting. The timing has been confirmed. I'm leaving.
[17:11] Mr. Arhum and miss Shenaya, I need to go home.
[17:15] Is everything alright?
Mother called, she sounded worried... she's asked me to be home.
[17:20] And there was noise in the back as well.
[17:24] Alright... don't worry. Arhum...
[17:28] it's important to drop her off. Take her and I'll take an off from work.
[17:33] Alright...
Let's go.
[18:02] Farheen, listen to me!
[18:13] Farheen... what are you doing?
What are you doing sister? Let go of this!
[18:19] What's the matter with you?
My happiness is dead...
[18:23] Let me die too.
[18:28] What did brother Haris do?
Haris has divorced Farheen.
[18:40] Sister...
[18:42] I'm with Fabiha...
[18:49] Greetings mother, how are you?
Greetings to you too... I'm well.
[18:55] How are you? You didn't call me in a while, so I decided to call you.
[19:01] Mother you know.. with work, I have to look after home as well.
[19:07] Last week was very busy
[19:09] I had to take an off from work today because Fabiha had an emergency with her family.
[19:14] I was so busy that I couldn't call you.
[19:17] I did talk to brother Junaid. Did you go to the doctor for your routine check up?
[19:22] Yes Junaid and Somia took me..
[19:26] The tests were great... tell me...
[19:31] How are Hadi and Hareem?
[19:34] Tell me how Arhum is as well.
[19:38] The kids and Arhum are great...
[19:41] Look at me... I am so busy...
[19:45] that I forgot to give you good news...
Really... what good news...
[19:51] Arhum has been promoted.
[19:54] That's great! Many congratulations!
[19:57] May God keep you and your husband happy.
[20:02] Amen mother... I'm very happy as well.
I pray that my daughter remains happy.
[20:09] And God save you from evil eyes.
[20:29] Did Hamza not tel you?
No, he didn't tell us anything.
[20:34] Did Hamza not tell you anything about sister's divorce?
[20:39] It happened today.
[20:45] Sister Shaheen I didn't know anything about this. If I did...
[20:51] I wouldn't come here to ask a date for the wedding.
[21:00] Enough sister... why are you killing yourself for that man?
[21:09] I can't believe it.
[21:13] He has betrayed me!
[21:19] Haris has betrayed me!
[21:27] Fabiha... please...
[21:33] I didn't know that he would turn about to be such heartless man.
[21:39] Control yourself please...
[21:49] Be strong.
[21:51] Look at me...
[21:56] You're very strong.
[21:59] I'm not... I don't have the strength in me anymore.
[22:05] I'm tired..
[22:17] Control yourself and look at me...
[22:21] Did you talk to him... did he say something?
[22:25] Did you two fight... tell me something.
[22:33] He said that...
[22:36] he would call me Muscat next week.
[22:45] Did you say something that he minded?
[22:49] Did you say something...
[22:54] No.
[22:56] Fabiha... we didn't fight.
[23:00] I was just betrayed.
[23:04] Sister... you weren't betrayed, he is the one who has suffered a loss.
[23:08] He will regret it... he was lucky to have a girl like you.
[23:15] Don't cry for no reason for that man...
[23:24] You'll find a man a hundred times better.
[23:31] What will I do now? Where will I go now?
[23:35] All of us are with you... mother is here, I'm here.
[23:44] I have become a divorcee!
[23:49] Nothing has happened.
[23:52] Everything is over.
[23:55] Nothing is over... we're here for you.
[24:03] Thank you my dear.
[24:05] You came here to drop Fabiha..
No need... this was an emergency..
[24:11] and I was obligated to help. Don't worry, everything will be well.
[24:16] How can it my dear? The sister that Fabiha sacrificed for...
[24:21] all was in-vain.
[24:25] You still haven't left...
No... is she okay now?
[24:30] How can a person be when walking over coals?
[24:34] She's crying over her fate.
[24:37] It takes time to recover from trauma, but everything will be alright, don't worry.
[24:43] If God is willing.
I'll get going.
[24:47] Sir...
[24:48] Thank you so much.
[24:50] See you late, bye
Thank you.
[25:03] What's the matter? Why are you so worried?
How could I not worry?
[25:08] Ma'am gave me the checks... and I cashed them myself.
[25:14] I don't know how it got missed, and there's no record of it.
How will you get a record?
[25:19] How come you gave that new cashier a check made out to cash...
[25:26] He knows that you'll have to take a hit for it.
That's the issues and this will be checked in the audit tomorrow.
[25:33] They will fire me.
[25:37] There might be an issue with the audit... let me think of something.
[25:45] Fabiha called me... I'll talk to you later... I have to call her.
[25:51] Don't worry...
[26:13] Hello... did you find the time to call me?
[26:17] What's the matter? I was in a meeting...
[26:19] Hamza, it's always the same thing with you... either it's a meeting or it's traffic.
[26:25] You're not here when I need you. What should I do with such love?
[26:30] You make such huge proclamations.
What happened?
[26:39] Hamza, brother Haris has sent my sister divorce papers..
[26:44] Thank God that Arhum dropped me home, otherwise I would have lost a lot of time because of you.
[26:49] Sorry... I had no idea...
[26:52] Come home quickly...
[26:57] Lunch is ready... sandwich for you and French Fries for Hadi..
[27:05] Mother... where's auntie Fabiha, she served us lunch every day.
[27:10] Auntie Fabiha had to go home because of an emergency.
[27:13] That's why I've taken a days off for you two.
Who will play puzzles with us today?
[27:19] I will and I will win...
[27:23] No...
What's the point in making the kids happy for a single day?
[27:27] Hand me the phone... let me ask Fabiha what happened.
[27:35] Bring it! Arhum...
[27:38] Thank God you're here... what happened there?
Don't worry... everything is okay.
[27:44] Did you not go to work?
[27:48] No... I didn't go to work.
What happened that made her mother call her home?
[27:55] Fabiha's elder sister has been divorced.
[28:01] She was attempting suicide, that's why her mother called her. We reached there on time.
[28:09] Thank God...
[28:14] Please make me a cup of coffee Shenaya... I'm too tired. I'm going to my room.
[28:21] Mother, I'll take you to your room.
[28:24] Sure... take me. Thank you.
[28:29] Was Fabiha worried?
[28:51] Sister eat something.. you haven't eaten anything since morning.
[28:56] I've made your favorite veggies...
Get up...
[29:01] Eat a little bit.
[29:09] Mother... I'm not hungry.
How long will you starve yourself?
[29:14] You haven't eaten anything since morning. Eat a little bit.
[29:19] Come on.
[29:33] Fate has killed me.
[29:39] Why do you want to keep me alive?
[29:42] Sister, we can't change what happened. You will gain nothing by punishing yourself.
[29:47] I should be punished.
[29:51] Right mother?
[29:54] I should be punished, right?
[29:58] For that man and his love...
[30:02] I suspected your love, forgive me mother.
[30:07] What are you doing? Don't do this.
[30:13] Look.
[30:16] When emotion take over our mind..
[30:21] we understand nothing.
[30:27] When someone makes a joke out of our emotion?
[30:33] Do we not understand it even then?
[30:44] This love has ruined me.
[30:52] Stop crying the two of you!
[30:56] You should thank God that he left you? Just imagine what he would have done if he had taken you with him?
[31:07] And mother... instead of making her understand you are crying.
[31:13] Why am I explaining things to you?
[31:43] It's been so many days since you called, so I decided to come here.
[31:49] No... it's not like that.
[31:53] I was about to call you.
[31:57] But... I didn't get the chance.
[32:00] Where is sister Farheen... I can't see her...
[32:03] Farheen... she's not well. She's sleeping.
[32:10] There is a virus going on, every home has a sick person.
[32:14] Yes indeed.
I came here because of something important.
[32:23] Is everything alright?
[32:26] The thing is that... you're well now..
[32:32] And next month is coming here from Hyderabad.
[32:36] So I've decided to set the date for Hamza and Fabiha's wedding.
[32:41] I don't want any refusals... please life this duty off of me.
[32:47] It seems that you have listened to my heart. I want to do this duty as soon as possible.
[32:54] Look... time doesn't remain the same.
[32:58] First there's happiness, then sadness.
[33:02] You're right about that. So give me a date.
[33:07] I think...
[33:10] How about the 18th?
It's settled then, I'll bring my brother's barat on the 18th.
[33:16] If it were up to her she would do it today.
[33:22] When is Farheen going away?
Did Hamza not tell you?
[33:26] No... Hamza told me nothing...
Hamza didn't tell you anything about sister's divorce?
[33:32] Divorce?
It happened today.
[33:40] Sister Shaheen, I didn't know about this. If I had...
[33:46] I would never have come here for the wedding date.
[33:50] It's not your fault.
[34:01] I'll win you'll see!
[34:08] Oh no... okay... yes you win!
[34:15] Let's start and see who wins this time...
[35:20] What need was there to mention Farheen's name in front of sister Nasreen?
[35:26] What was so wrong? How long would we have hidden it?
[35:30] They would bound to know at some point.
Do you know the meaning of divorce?
[35:37] No matter how innocent a woman is, people always ask question of the woman in a divorce. Do we have the answers?
[35:45] Foolish girl... one has to be cautious in front of one's in-laws.
[35:52] Mother... such a big tragedy has happened to sister and you're worried about me?
[35:59] How hurt will she be when she finds out.
[36:03] Let her wounds fill.
[36:07] Fabiha... I'm a mother to both of you. I don't bad for anyone...
[36:14] But after Farheen I'm concerned for you.
[36:18] Lord knows what's written in her fate. But you shouldn't turn away from your fate.
[36:24] Look, marry Hamza and go to your home.
Mother...
[36:30] What do you want?
[36:33] Do I want me to gamble your honor? Do you want me to listen to you?\
[36:38] When did I say that? That will not happen now...
[36:43] That will not happen. My decision is set in stone, there is no room for refusal.
[36:55] The 18th... you'll be...
[37:00] married on the 18th.
[37:03] Make your home respectfully... or bury it like Farheen.
[37:13] Get up from here.
[37:20] Lord knows what will happen to these girls.
[37:36] So you're here... why didn't you bring the barat?
[37:41] What's the matter Fabiha?
You're asking that?
[37:47] Like you know that your mother was coming to ask about the wedding date.
[37:54] Did you know or not?
[37:57] I did.
[38:02] Do you think we can get married under the circumstances?
[38:09] Sister is crying for her life and you want me to parade my happiness?
[38:17] Do you think that everything will change after the wedding?
[38:24] What will change? My life or the situation of this home?
[38:29] Fabiha..
[38:32] I didn't expect this from you.
Fabiha...
[38:36] listen to me...
What should I listen to?
[38:40] Is there anything left for you to say?
[38:42] I was stuck with an issue from my office. They are about to fire me.
[38:48] I didn't get the chance to talk to mother. Why are you so negative?
[38:54] Will we spend our lives like this? Will you provide for me without a job?
[39:03] Why are you getting so hyper? Let's talk it out.
[39:08] Then do it... 
[39:12] Until sister comes out of this trauma, I will not marry you.
