[01:13] So you are going through such a bad phase that you are getting scared from children.
[01:18] I am not scared, I am advising you.
[01:21] Children are suffering for no reason because of your jealousy.
[01:26] I am afraid they will stand against you.
[01:28] I want to marry Hamza.
[01:33] I like him and I said this to him.
[01:37] Shameless girl.
[01:39] My one daughter has already humiliated me.
[01:41] And you haven't left anything to do that. Oh God have mercy.
[01:44] But what's wrong in it mom? You also want me to get married.
[01:51] I did it sister.
OK, now put your clothes in that and only put two suits.
[02:00] I did it sister.
Done. We will meet in school tomorrow.
[02:22] So you didn't think once since last night.
[02:30] Hamza, swear on the name of you mother that you didn't think about me once since last night.
[02:40] If you really want to see me happy and lessen mom's burden and she may live peacefully then please accept my condition.
[03:16] Why haven't you slept yet?
[03:19] I couldn't sleep.
[03:21] I was feeling thirsty but I got worried when I saw that light of your room is switched on
[03:30] Leave me, why are you so worried?
[03:35] Nothing significant, it's because of work burden.
[03:40] But sister Farheen doesn't get worried because of work.
[03:44] Her job is different, she manages to do easier tasks.
[03:48] But I have to meet with big clients outdoor in restaurants and hotels.
[03:56] Whatever that may be but I don't think that you are only worried because of work.
[04:04] You must be hiding something from me.
Why would I hide anything from you?
[04:12] By the way mom is no more with us that you can threat me that you will tell her.
[04:19] OK don't tell me, sister Farheen has told me about everything.
[04:28] What did Farheen tell you?
[04:33] She is mad, don't trust her.
Relax brother, relax.
[04:40] What she had to tell me?
[04:44] That aunt wants you to marry sister Farheen.
[04:50] There is nothing to worry about.
[04:54] Nothing
[04:56] It's too late so go to sleep. Why are you discussing this topic at this time. Go to sleep.
[05:02] What sister Farheen had to tell me that you became so confused.
[05:05] There is nothing like that and I am not confused.
[05:10] And I am telling you that it's too late so go to sleep.
[05:14] You also go to sleep, it's too late.
[06:00] Wow, Hadi you got ready by yourself today.
Mom told me that we should do our work by ourselves.
[06:07] I know what your mom is trying to teach you. Tell me that you have put all books and geometry box in your bag?
[06:12] Mom also told me that I shouldn't be afraid of aunt Fabiha.
[06:18] And I won't get afraid from you now.
What did you say?
[06:24] You won't get afraid from me?
Yes.
[06:27] Hmm
[06:30] And what if I lock you in the room then what will you do because your mom won't come here to save you?
[06:36] Mom told me that dad is with me.
But dad listens to me so he won't listen to you.
[06:44] And by the way when you will be locked in the room then your voice won't go out of the room.
[06:50] OK then, I am locking you in the room so won't get food and water.
I will tell dad about this.
Hadi
[07:10] Hadi.
What happened Hadi?
[07:14] Aunt Fabiha was beating me and she was also scolding me and trying to lock me in the room.
[07:20] What is he saying Fabiha?
[07:21] I am right. She scares me.
He is lying.
[07:26] He misbehaved with me and said that you took my mom's place.
Hadi what is this?
[07:31] You misbehaved with aunt Fabiha. Say sorry.
No, she is lying.
[07:36] I said, say sorry.
[07:38] I won't say sorry. I won't say, I won't say.
[07:44] Hadi I said, say sorry.
[07:47] Sorry
[07:52] Fabiha he is getting rude day by day. I am really sorry for that.
[07:58] Fabiha, I will drop Hadi to school but please pick him at 1 PM because I have an important meeting. Right?
OK.
[08:05] Come, let's have breakfast.
[08:19] Mom, I have brought breakfast for you. Eat it.
[08:24] Take it away. I don't want to eat.
[08:28] Mom, why aren't you eating? Please don't do this.
Add some poison in it.
[08:35] So that I can die peacefully.
[08:39] So that I can get relax.
OK don't eat.
[08:43] But think once with a cool head that if I get married to Hamza...
[08:57] Mom, what's wrong in it if I want to share Hamza's worries and sorrows?
[09:07] He hasn't forgotten betrayal of Fabiha yet.
[09:16] If Fabiha can hurt him then why can't we cure his wounds?
[09:26] Tell me one thing, will you refuse even if Hamza get convinced for this proposal?
[09:37] Are you more worried about your daughter's age than getting her married.
[09:46] Mom there are so many girls who are elder than their husbands so what's wrong in it if I am elder than Hamza?
[09:55] Both of us will take care of each other.
[09:59] Mom, I thought about it thoroughly and then said this to Hamza.
[10:09] I have seen some flexibility in him.
[10:14] I feel that he is hesitant only because of Fabiha.
[10:34] Suppose you get married to Hamza
[10:41] Then how will we face Fabiha?
Mom, Fabiha is settled in her life.
[10:50] And she is very happy in her house.
[10:55] So think about me, I am still waiting to get married.
[11:01] But no, you don't care about me.
[11:08] You only think about Fabiha.
[11:14] And by the way, I don't think that any decision made in this house would effect Fabiha.
[11:32] What's up Hania?
[11:39] OK, I am coming.
[11:43] I have to change my dress then I will come
[11:49] OK
[11:54] It was Hania's call, she wants me to visit her house.
[12:26] Hareem come quickly my dear.
Greetings. Greetings.
[12:32] Brother
[12:34] Brother, documents file needs to be collected from lawyer's office. Will you pick that?
[12:38] Actually I have to pick Hareem and visit the site as well.
OK, don't worry, I will pick that.
[12:45] Tell me about the progress of Hadi's custody?
[12:49] The file is ready and Arham will receive the notice today and we will also get hearing date.
[12:56] Hmm
[12:58] Look
[12:59] I would still prefer that if you can talk to Arham and settle this matter out of court then that will be better.
[13:09] As you know that Arham is very emotional.
[13:14] And he can't overcome his emotions and doesn't care what he says and what he decides so I don't want to take that risk.
[13:24] This time it's not the matter of Sanaya's love
[13:31] It's a matter of a mother's love and I can't share my children
[13:37] OK
[13:40] Don't worry, I will collect documents and will also discuss with lawyer. Right?
Thanks brother.
[13:46] OK, I must leave, I am already very late.
But you didn't eat anything.
I will eat in office. Bye.
[13:52] Why are you going without eating.
Bye. Come on Hareem.
[14:05] Let's go. Get in the car.
[14:23] Hareem, what's the matter? Why are you so quiet?
[14:30] Nothing.
[14:33] So why aren't you saying anything.
[14:36] Will you listen to me?
Of course, why wouldn't I listen to my daughter?
[14:44] What about going to sea side after school time?
[14:49] We will sit there and will have a long chat.
[14:53] OK?
[15:35] Mom, I was missing so much. When will you come back?
[15:41] What happened? Why are you crying?
I am crying because I don't know how long will I have to live without you?
[16:15] Now go to school.
Go to your class. OK.
[17:22] Hello.
Greetings mom, how are you?
[17:26] Greetings, Fabiha, I am fine. Tell me about yourself.
[17:32] How is your health. Are you taking proper diet.
I am fine and taking good care of myself. Tell me where is sister Farheen?
[17:40] Why? What happened?
[17:42] Tell me where is she?
Farheen has gone to Hania's house. Her marriage is fixed.
[17:51] She had to buy some things and had to pack some stuff so she has gone there.
[17:56] OK. Tell me that what did you say to her that she was shouting on me?
[18:03] What did I do?
You know her.
[18:09] She exaggerates the minor thing.
[18:14] It's her habit and you know about that.
[18:17] Mom
[18:18] Mom was sister Farheen as much possessive for brother Haris as much she is for Hamza right now?
[18:27] I am not having good vibes about her intentions. So please ask her about her plan.
[18:36] Because Hamza's nature is completely different.
[18:41] And Hamza doesn't like her at all.
[18:46] But why are you getting worried?
[18:51] Why would I get worried. I am just telling you.
[18:56] OK fine. I will talk to you later. I have to cook curry. Right?
OK.
[19:26] Dubai ticket?
[19:31] Hello
[19:33] How was my surprise?
[19:35] Very good but not as good as you.
[19:44] So you made my passport because of this.
Yes, I want to fill some more colors in your life.
[19:54] You have really filled colors in my life by giving me this surprise.
[20:02] Thank you so much.
You're most welcome. Now you should get ready because we have to go there tomorrow.
[20:11] And I have also booked ticket for Hadi.
[20:15] So also pack his things.
[20:20] Right?
[20:26] Bye
[20:37] Who takes children with them on honey moon?
[21:06] Hamza will have to live alone.
[21:09] And I don't want this to happen that's why I have asked you to come here. Please talk to him and convince him because he listens to you.
[21:16] For what?
To get married. I have chosen a girl, she is sister of my friend and she is very nice.
[21:22] Sanaya, where can children go? They must be in school.
I don't know, where have they gone?
[21:37] Hania
[21:38] Why have you asked to come so suddenly?
[21:48] What's the matter? You look worried.
[21:52] Didn't Hamza say anything?
It's a matter of concern that's why I have asked you to come.
[21:59] So that you can help me.
[22:04] What kind of help?
[22:09] I will get married after two months and then brother will live alone in this house. And I don't want him to live alone.
[22:19] Well, when you will leave this house after your marriage then Hamza will have to live alone.
[22:25] And I don't want this to happen that's why I have asked you to come here. Please talk to him and convince him because he listens to you.
[22:32] For what?
To get married. I have chosen my friend's sister. She is very nice.
[22:44] If brother gets convinced then I will talk to my friend. They are also finding proposal for their sister.
[22:54] Please, will you talk to him?
[23:01] He will listen to you. Please talk to him.
[23:13] OK, I will try.
Thank you so much sister Farheen.
[23:21] Here comes brother.
[23:35] I asked her to come here to help me in choosing clothes so I called her.
[23:52] Go and please convince him. Till then I will make delicious food for you. Go.
[25:23] What's up sir.
OK, I am coming.
[26:00] Sister, where are we going?
We are going to a place where there are so many children but their parents are not there.
[26:44] Please ask Hareem and Hadi to come out.
Hareem and Hadi were here just a while ago.
[26:53] But they are not here.
Trust me, I saw them standing here.
[27:04] If you asked them to sit here then where did they go?
I don't know where have they gone?
[27:12] Did you see them my dear?
Yes, I saw them, they were sitting inside.
[27:18] Was Hadi with Hareem?
Yes.
[28:27] What's up Sanaya?
Arham, children are not in school.
[28:37] How would I know?
Children are not in school.
[28:42] Fabiha went to pick him from school.
Children are missing and you are concerned about Fabiha.
[28:54] Sanaya, where can they go? They must be in school.
I don't know, where have they gone?
[29:19] OK I am coming. I am nearby. Stay there.
[29:32] Excuse me, I have to go. We will continue later. Bye
[29:56] What's up.
Hi Mom.
[29:59] I called you to share a very big good news. I can't tell you that Arham has given me such a big surprise.
[30:04] What has he gifted you?
Mom, Arham is taking me to Dubai for two weeks.
[30:10] Our flight is scheduled for tomorrow. I am so happy and I am telling you before anyone else.
[30:15] Wow, wow that's really a great news.
[30:18] That's good. Go with your husband for this trip and enjoy yourself.
Amen
[30:23] I am getting this after a very difficult time so kindly pray for me that my happiness may not get effected by someone's evil sight.
[30:27] Amen. My good wishes are with you. Have safe travels.
[30:33] I will talk to you later because I have to pack my luggage. Bye.
Bye my child.
[30:41] O my Lord thanks a lot.
[31:36] Hamza
[31:40] What do you want now?
[31:44] Hania wants me to talk to you.
[31:51] She thinks that I can convince you for anything.
[31:58] She thinks that you listen to me more than her because we have a bonding with each other.
[32:08] But she doesn't know that our friendship has ended.
[32:30] Hamza
[32:32] When you used to come to me for sharing your feelings after Fabiha's betrayal then I liked to spend time with you.
[32:42] And I forgot Haris' betrayal.
[32:47] So tell me, did I do anything wrong?
[32:52] After Haris left me, then you supported me as my friend.
[33:04] And I started to like you and I started to feel your pain more than you.
[33:19] I felt that I can take Fabiha's place in your life.
What do you want to say?
[33:28] No, leave it.
[33:30] Now it's useless to discuss this.
[33:35] Actually, Hania wants you get convinces for proposal of her friend's sister then she will talk to her friend about that.
[33:46] She doesn't want you to live alone after her marriage.
[33:53] If you agree then tell me, I will ask Hania to talk to her friend.
[34:12] And what did you say to Hania?
[34:17] You have to answer her question.
[34:23] I have conveyed her message to you.
[34:29] And I don't want to say anything else.
[34:42] Listen
[34:57] What do you think?
[35:03] What should I say to Hania?
[35:06] You will decide that
[35:13] That with whom you want to replace Fabiha in your life?
[36:08] Oh God, I forgot to pick Hadi because of packing.
Hello.
[36:15] I am leaving. No don't worry, I will reach there. OK bye.
[36:38] Arham, children are not in school.
Sanaya, control yourself, they must be around.
[36:43] Where is Fabiha?
[36:45] Think about children, I don't know where they have gone?
Let me ask.
[37:02] Let's check there.
[37:27] Hadi. Hadi. Hareem.
[37:32] Hadi. Hadi
[37:35] Hareem. Hareem.
[37:38] Fabiha
[37:41] Fabiha that was your responsibility to pick Hadi.
[37:43] Why didn't you come on time?
I was on the way but there was so much traffic.
[37:46] Both me and Sanaya have come in the same traffic so how did both of us reach here?
[37:53] Now where do I search my children.
This is not right time to fight.
[37:56] I don't know where are my children. I want my children back at any cost.
They are my children as well and I am trying to find them.
[38:03] It was your responsibility then why did you ask her to pick him?
Did you fulfill your responsibility about Hareem?
[38:09] I want my children back.
Did you ask from school management?
[38:13] I have asked but they don't know.
We should report this case to police.
[38:17] Yes, you are right, I am going to police station.
I will also go with you.
[38:20] No, you can't go there. Go home with her.
No, I will go with you.
[38:24] I want my children back.
I will find them. Trust me. You should go home. It's not right for you to go to police station.
Promise me Arham
[38:31] Promise me that you will bring my children back. Please promise me.
[38:36] I promise that I will bring children back. You should go home.
[38:39] Fabiha, please take Sanaya to home. OK?
I am going to police station.
[38:45] Oh God.
[38:47] Junaid. Junaid.
[38:50] What happened? Why are you so nervous?
[38:53] Nothing is right.
[38:55] Sanaya called me, children are missing.
[38:58] What do you mean by that?
God knows, where have they gone?
[39:04] She told me that she have searched in school but they are not there.
They must be in school. Where will they go?
[39:11] Didn't someone kidnap them?
No, they must be there. They must went out to buy something and will come back.
[39:21] Please call your friend inspector Farooq. He will definitely help us.
OK, let me call him.
[39:34] Let's go to Sanaya's hosue, she must be alone there.
OK. let's go. Brother Farooq.
Anaya.
