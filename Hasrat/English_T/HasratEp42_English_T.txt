[02:31] where is your husband, Sanaya?
[02:35] I apologize, madam, but he has a very important meeting today and won't be able to join us
[02:40] As you know, our school's rules require both parents to be present.
[02:45] I know madam
[02:46] actually...
[02:48] Do you know how much parental ignorance can disturb children?
[02:52] do you have any idea of it?
[02:57] yes madam, I understand
[02:59] No, you don't. Do you know how important a father is for children?
[03:03] And the negative impact it will have on them?
[03:11] You are his wife; you should try to make him understand
[03:16] yes
[03:20] Well, as usual, the parents are called every year to discuss the children's progress
[03:25] And your children have always been at the top
[03:29] But for the past few days, Hadi has been completely lost.
[03:41] Since last semester, Hadi has been physically present in class, but mentally absent
[03:50] His class teacher has complained to me
[03:54] that he doesn't pay attention. He has been physically present, but mentally absent
[04:00] he is quite disturbed
[04:06] See, I have no concern with whatever issues are going on in your house
[04:09] But the children are being negatively impacted because of it
[04:16] See, if our school's children's progress is affected in any way, it becomes a point of humiliation for us
[04:29] Ms. Sanaya, parental responsibility doesn't only mean sending them to school
[04:33] They need to look after the kids, check their syllabus, and give them complete attention
[04:37] Otherwise, their progress will continue to decline
[04:44] the way Hadi's progress is declining
[04:49] He gets frustrated with every issue and misbehaves with his teacher over the smallest things
[04:53] Please look into this matter. Right now, it is crucial for both of you to pay attention to him
[05:00] See, he will be completely fine if he gets attention.
 Do you understand my point?
[05:06] yes madam, I am understanding
[05:11] I will do my best to ensure Hadi's performance is not affected
[05:15] that's great!
[05:17] what about Hareem's progress, Madam?
[05:20] yes, she is perfect
[05:23] I will do my best to ensure you do not receive any complaints about Hadi
[05:27] Thank you so much!
[05:28] Thank you!
[06:25] please sit
[06:28] I got to know about your mother from Sanaya, sorry to hear about her Arham
[06:32] My house doesn't feel like home since my mother's demise
[06:35] true that
[06:37] Well, Sanaya hasn't come for a long time, and she hasn't had her routine check-up either
[06:41] yes, actually she is busy nowadays
[06:45] Oh ok
[06:47] I might have seen her somewhere
[06:51] Um... she visited with Aunt Riffat once.
[06:57] Yes, I think she was her caretaker. Did you bring her for the check-up?
[07:01] yes, to her
[07:03] that's so sweet of you Arham. You take very good care of your servants too
[07:06] She is my wife
[07:08] yes, she is my wife
[07:11] I'm really sorry, I had no idea that the caretaker is your wife
[07:20] Well, tell me what happened to her
[07:25] nothing...
[07:26] she is feeling dizzy
[07:28] since when?
[07:30] since today morning
[07:32] Okay
[07:33] Arham, please go out for a while. Meanwhile, let me check her
[07:36] Ok
[07:41] please sit here, I am coming
[07:44] they will change your medicine, mom
are you fine?
[07:48] number 42 is going on, & our number is 43
[07:56] are you fine?
[07:58] who is Asiya among you?
[07:59] yes, she is my mother
[08:00] Please come, we'll check your blood pressure first then we'll take you to the doctor
[08:04] Somya, stay here. Let me go for mom's check up. Be careful
[08:29] yes Shehla, did you call me?
[08:31] yes Arham, please come in
[08:39] is everything fine?
[08:41] nothing to worry. But yes, she is going to be a mother
[08:54] anyways, I am prescribing a few vitamins. Do give her on time
[09:12] thank you!
[09:31] hey sister Somya, you are here. Is everything fine?
[09:36] We wouldn't be here if everything had been fine
[09:39] I'm disappointed that these matters no longer seem to affect you
[10:02] lets go, Fabiha
[10:06] you go, I am coming in a minute
[10:12] I intended to share this good news with Sanaya first
[10:19] But anyway, it's fine. Since I met you, let me tell you
[10:23] congratulate me
[10:25] I am about to give Arham the happiness that completes a family
[10:39] I wanted Sanaya and I to live together, from the bottom of my heart, but...
[10:44] She wanted to oust me from Arham's house and life
[10:51] Now, her way back is completely clear
[11:01] Would you like to have the sweetmeats at our place, or should I send them to your house?
[11:05] along with my husband's first wife!
[11:54] It seems you couldn't sleep all night.
[11:57] Even your eyes are swollen
[12:00] and your hopes are breaking.
[12:08] I told you to live peacefully but no
[12:12] you liked to eat in a single plate
[12:20] I'll do something in return if you plan to throw me out.
[12:25] I left everything and caught on Arham's weakness.
[12:34] You lost your husband because of your stupidity
[12:40] and I told him to get this plot from you.
[12:44] And we have to take a lot more now. Like this house,
[12:48] the kids
[12:50] and everything else
[13:41] hello!
[13:44] how are you, Shehla?
[13:45] I am fine, but you tell me how are you doing?
[13:51] I am absolutely fine
[13:54] How can a woman be happy when her husband gets remarried?
[14:02] Sanaya, you used to share your each & every matter with me
[14:06] Then how could you hide such a big matter?
[14:10] What could I have told you?
[14:13] That the person with whom I had dreamed of sharing all my happiness...
[14:18] His hatred has shattered me
[14:26] And broken dreams have no interpretation
[14:31] Neither do they get fulfilled by simply telling someone, nor do they start afresh by just sleeping again
[14:36] but Sanaya, at least you could have lessen your heart's burden
[14:41] If this heart has any burden, it's just two words: 'marriage.'
[14:48] anyways, who told you?
[14:50] Did Arham come to see you?
[14:53] Yes, he just left
[14:57] anything special?
[14:58] No no, everything is fine
[15:02] Okay
[15:06] Bye!
[16:02] hey Arham, you are here!
[16:04] how are you?
[16:04] All good, thanks to God
[16:07] We didn't see you at the parents' meeting today. Sister Sanaya was alone
[16:10] Yes, I had some work and was busy, so I couldn't come
[16:13] It seems Sanaya made you incur quite a lot of expenses today
[16:17] No sister, its not like that
[16:18] By the way, Sister Sanaya is so naive and innocent that she allowed you to go shopping with a caretaker
[16:25] Excuse me!
[16:29] I am his wife
[16:32] Okay
[16:49] I intended to share this good news with Sanaya first
[16:53] But anyway, it's fine. Since I met you, let me tell you
[16:57] congratulate me
[17:00] I am about to give Arham the happiness that completes a family
[17:10] I wanted Sanaya and I to live together, from the bottom of my heart, but...
[17:14] She wanted to oust me from Arham's house and life
[17:21] Now, her way back is completely clear
[17:33] what happened, Somya?
[17:37] are you upset on something?
[17:44] you are quite since you came out of the hospital
[17:47] have you mind something?
[17:54] tell me, what's the matter?
[17:57] I saw brother Arham at the hospital
[18:01] so, was Sanaya with him as well?
[18:05] he was with Fabiha
[18:17] well, they are husband & wife now
[18:24] he can take her anywhere, why to worry?
[18:30] there is a lot of difference between anywhere & hospital, Junaid
[18:35] They didn't just come over there; there was a reason behind it
[18:46] means?
[18:47] what happened?
[18:51] Fabiha is expecting
[18:56] brother Arham is about to become a father of her child
[19:15] did you talk to Sanaya?
[19:19] what shall I talk to her about, Junaid?
[19:22] I cannot talk to her
[19:31] Dr. Shehla didn't discuss anything with us either
[19:36] maybe, she became quiet because of mom
[19:47] don't discuss this matter with mom, ok?
[19:50] Junaid, I am so worried about Sanaya
[19:57] I don't know how that poor girl will react once she learns all this
[20:07] I don't understand, how to help my sister
[20:13] the poor woman had already shared her husband
[20:19] now she has to share her children father too
[20:25] If I think like a brother, I feel like bringing her to me, even if it means taking her away from Arham
[20:34] but when I think as a father
[20:37] I feel as if her marriage shall stay intact
[20:45] what shall I do?
[20:47] Junaid
[20:49] I am so worried about Sanaya & her children
[20:56] don't know how she will face all this alone?
[21:03] Kindly talk to Sanaya
[21:05] Junaid, how will I talk to her?
[21:09] I cannot
[21:12] See, you are also a woman
[21:18] and then you are Sanaya's sister-in-law as well
[21:20] you can talk to her
[21:25] please
[21:30] thank you!
[23:06] Arham doesn't realize his responsibilities
[23:13] but I...
[23:16] how can I become so careless about the kids?
[23:20] I couldn't focus on the kids
[23:26] I have to talk to Arham
[23:43] Arham, you've done so much shopping. We don't even know yet whether it's a boy or a girl
[23:47] it doesn't make any difference to me, whether its a son or a daughter
[23:50] I only know one thing: our family is about to be complete
[23:56] Given the good news you've shared with me, it's now my duty to fulfill every one of your desires
[24:06] now close your eyes
[24:08] Why?
[24:08] I am telling you to close your eyes
[24:10] but why shall I close my eyes?
trust me, I am your husband. Please
[24:13] Okay
[24:18] no cheating..
[24:20] what are you doing?
[24:21] as I said, no cheating
[24:34] hey, its the same chain
[24:35] yes, its the same chain
[24:36] Where did you see it?
[24:38] What kind of husband doesn't pay attention to his wife's desires?
[24:41] Thank you!
[24:44] do you like it?
[24:45] I love it!
[25:26] As long as Fabiha lives in this house, she will never let Arham get close to the kids
[25:32] She will keep Arham involved by making up thousands of excuses
[25:37] why Arham don't understand
[25:39] These matters will have a negative impact on the children's minds
[25:43] I wish...
[25:45] I wish I had never let Fabiha enter my life
[26:02] What kind of husband doesn't pay attention to his wife's desires?
[26:06] Arham doesn't care about his responsibilities anymore
[26:11] Arham never considered that his behavior and rational attitude were not good for us
[26:20] But... how could I have been so careless?
[26:25] I got so entangled in my own matters that I didn't pay any attention to the children
[26:31] How could I be so unaware?
[26:34] I have to talk to Arham for the sake of my children future
[26:40] oh God... please help me
[27:12] greetings sister
[27:14] greetings! what happened to your voice, Sanaya?
[27:23] Nothing, actually I was.. 
[27:26] I was cooking in the kitchen and cutting onions; maybe that's why you felt it
[27:33] Tell me, how are you? How is Mom? Did you take her to Dr. Shehla?
[27:38] mom is absolutely fine, we took her to doctor Shehla yesterday
[27:46] Arham even brought Fabiha over there yesterday
[27:54] Yes, Dr. Shehla called me. She was upset that I hadn't told her
[28:00] Did she say anything else?
[28:04] Nothing, she actually told me about you guys
[28:09] Okay
[28:14] why, what happened?
[28:16] No, nothing...
[28:19] I thought to ask about your well-being
[28:26] anyways, I will call you back after cooking the food
[28:28] Okay?
bye!
[28:31] Okay
[29:29] I never thought that desires could be fulfilled so easily
[29:35] it took me so long to wait for this moment
[29:39] I just want to see you happy
[29:44] and now, you won't do any house chores
[29:47] I will ask Sanaya to arrange a help for you
[29:55] hey...
[29:58] Fabiha aunty, it's been so many days since you haven't made a sandwich for me
[30:07] Fabiha aunty, please make me some
[30:10] let me do something about your sandwich
[30:12] oh wow! So many new toys
[30:17] these aren't your toys, dad will bring your toys soon
[30:21] okay?
[30:28] you are joking, right dad?
[30:30] I am not joking. I will bring a new else for you, and a new big car for you as well. Promise
[30:37] Then, for whom are these, Dad?
[30:45] who is the kid in this house, except for us dad?
[30:53] Do you guys know that a new member is about to join this house? A tiny, cute one, just like Hadi
[31:02] why anyone will come in our house, Fabiha aunty?
[31:08] Hareem
[31:09] why are you saying this, Hareem?
[31:11] this is our house! We will not let anyone come into our house
[31:18] Hareem, bad manners. Say sorry
[31:21] I don't want to say sorry!
[31:23] Hareem!
[31:25] Fabiha aunty is a bad woman; she has distanced you from us, Dad
[31:28] Hareem! out
[31:48] I am sorry, don't know what happened to the kids
[31:52] they are getting ill-mannered day by day
[31:54] Its ok
[32:07] sister, please drink water
[32:10] I don't want to drink, Hadi
[32:12] Sister, Mom used to say that tears become dry from crying a lot
[32:17] nobody loves us
[32:20] dad scolds us, also mom too
[32:25] All of this happened because of Fabiha aunty; Mom and Dad both got distanced from us
[32:43] and I have an idea!
[32:47] what idea do you have?
[32:50] everything will be fine if we'll oust Fabiha aunty from this house
[32:54] No Hadi, we cannot oust her from this house
[32:59] She is our second mother
[33:02] we cannot oust her
[33:03] then what else shall we do, sister?
please drink some water
[33:47] Did you see the children's thoughts?
[33:49] I can't believe that the kids can say something like this
[33:57] Sanaya is instigating the kids against both of us
[34:04] I do understand about myself, but why against you?
[34:07] they are your children too, not only hers
[34:12] according to her, the kids are getting negative impact because of me
[34:16] However, as a mother, she is instigating the kids against both of us. Doesn't that ruin their personality?
[34:26] This child has not even entered the world yet, and Hareem is already thinking such things
[34:29] Once he comes into this world, Sanaya will make the kids enemies of each other
[34:33] nothing as such will ever happen, Fabiha
[34:35] The way Hadi and Hareem are my responsibility, so is this unborn baby
[34:45] its responsibility is mine
[34:52] even his rights responsibility is mine
[34:54] don't you worry
[34:56] but still Arham, I am so scared after listening to Hareem's words
[35:03] I am here with you, Hareem is a kid you know
[35:07] I am not scared of Hareem's words but of Sanaya's planning
[35:14] I know she wants to oust me from your life & this house, by using her children
[35:21] its not like that, Fabiha
[35:24] it is like that, Arham
[35:28] if I will feel any insecurity because of Sanaya then I will leave from this house along with my baby
[35:35] have you gone mad?
[35:38] you may think that way
[35:41] ok relax, I am with you. Please!
nothing as such will happen
[35:50] okay?
[36:54] hello!
[36:56] hello! Hamza
[36:58] you are still sleeping at home. That's why you haven't come to work as of yet
[37:03] and I had to wait for the bus in the morning because of you
[37:06] yes, I am sorry Farheen. I am not feeling well today, that's why I couldn't come
[37:15] I had sent a message to the boss
[37:17] Why? What happened to you?
[37:22] Nothing, its just a slight fever
[37:26] so, did you see a doctor?
[37:31] what's wrong Farheen?
[37:35] its just a slight fever, I am fine. What's the use of seeing a doctor for it?
[37:41] what's the big deal if you'll see a doctor?
[37:45] as it is, one shall never think that a fever is something small thing
[37:49] you've started to talk exactly like Hania
[37:55] Ok fine, I will go to the doctor. Happy now?
[38:00] now disconnect the call, as I have to make an important call to the client
[38:03] ok fine, bye!
but do see the doctor, please
[38:08] Bye
[38:23] what's the matter, why are you guys sitting here?
[38:29] Dad scolded us
[38:33] why?
[38:37] dad had brought new toys
[38:40] and they are not ours
[38:44] how is this possible? those toys must be for you my child
[38:49] no, they are not ours
[38:55] a new member is about to come into our house
[39:05] who said this to you?
[39:08] Fabiha aunty told us
[39:23] oust aunty Fabiha from this house like that day
[39:31] yes mom, absolutely!
[39:33] you should do this
