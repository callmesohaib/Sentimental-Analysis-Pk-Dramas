[03:48] nobody loves me
[03:54] everyone takes care of themselves, nobody cares for me
[03:57] my dear, who said that nobody takes care of you?
[04:00] mom takes very good care of her son

[05:39] Its hurting a lot, please call Arham
[05:41] what's the need to call Arham on such a small matter? Let me give you hot water bottle, you'll be fine
[05:46] I'm telling you to please call Arham
[05:48] I am here, I will take care of you. Nothing happened, you are perfectly fine
[05:53] where are you going?

[05:55] I will go myself
[06:07] mom
[06:10] now Fabiha aunty will go & complaint to dad about us
[06:15] No my dear, she won't say anything. Also it wasn't our mistake
[06:18] she came in front of us by mistake, its ok. Don't worry
[06:22] come, lets play
[07:05] what happened Junaid, you had gone to mom
[07:11] did mom said anything? Why you seem so worried?
[07:14] mom got to know about my discussion with Sanaya
[07:17] she was getting so upset, she was scolding me a lot
[07:20] What was the need for Sanaya to tell Mom everything?
[07:24] I have forbidden her many times, but she doesn't listen to me at all
[07:28] how will I appease her, tell me
[07:32] Junaid, Sanaya wouldn't have said anything like that to her. I know it
[07:40] I think, mom heard us when we were talking inside the kitchen
[07:49] I saw her passing by from there
[07:53] but I became the bad guy
[08:02] I upset her while trying to keep her health well.
[08:06] how will I appease her?
[08:08] its a temporary anger, Junaid
 she will agree
[08:17] just don't discuss this with Sanaya
[08:25] she is already so worried
[08:28] And we shouldn't make her more worried about her mother's matter
[08:38] I will talk to mom
[08:44] don't you worry, she will agree. Ok?
[08:48] Okay
[08:53] talk to her
[08:59] come on, get ready
[09:26] Happy birthday to you
[09:30] Happy birthday dear Fabiha
[09:34] Happy birthday to you
[09:57] What do you mean by "what is this"? You're saying it as if it's the first time
[10:02] Fabiha, its been 5 years that we are celebrating this birthday along with our relation
[11:55] what happened to you?
[11:58] nothing
[11:59] why are you hiding, tell me what happened to you?
[12:02] Actually, Sanaya ma'am and the kids were playing in the garden, and I got hit by the ball.
[12:09] come, lets go to the doctor with me
[12:11] don't worry, I am fine
[12:14] what do you mean that I shall not worry?
[12:16] don't worry, I am fine. They haven't thrown the ball deliberately
[12:20] it happens while playing
[12:26] no matter what, I am relieved that I didn't get badly injured
[12:29] what if something would have happened to this baby, then?
[12:31] Please
[12:36] don't say this again ever, please
[12:42] my happiness is associated with this baby
[12:45] its my duty to take care of this baby, lets go to the doctor
please don't think wrong
[12:50] She got so worried herself that she made me sit here.
[12:58] I know she doesn't like me, and everything associated with me
[13:07] but... what kind of a jealousy with this little one?
[13:15] You won't neglect the rights of your other kids after the birth of this baby.
[13:24] maybe, Sanaya maam is afraid of it
[13:31] She believes that if she becomes distant from you, her children's father will also become distant
[13:41] but she can never do this
[13:48] no matter that she is my husband's first wife, but killing my baby...
[13:52] she cannot think this way
[14:35] come on, quickly finish this juice. Ok
[14:50] Sanaya
Sanaya
[14:54] yes
[14:57] I want to talk to you
[15:01] what's the matter?
[15:03] Sanaya look, whatever I am going to ask you just answer me truly. Don't lie
[15:09] what happened Arham, what's the matter?
[15:13] Did Fabiha get hit by the ball?
[15:23] Arham, listen to me
[15:24] I need an answer for what I am asking please, no explanation
[15:27] did she get hit by the ball or not, just answer me
[15:30] yes, she got hit
[15:36] But Arham, it was an accidental hit; we didn't deliberately hit her. She came there herself
[15:41] have some God fear
[15:45] I am trying to make you good in front of my husband & you are continuously lying
[15:49] there is a limit of everything, Sanaya
[15:57] Sanaya, if something had happened to my baby, who would have been responsible?
[16:01] Arham
[16:04] how can you even think this way? It happened by mistake, we haven't done that deliberately
[16:08] it got hit by mistake, do you even know how much pain she is in
[16:21] she was completely fine now
[16:23] I swear, she is completely fine
[16:26] come on Sanaya, you mean to say all of this is a drama
[16:34] she is in pain because she got hit by the ball, & you think its a drama
[16:37] I am saying the right thing, Arham
[16:43] Just a while ago, she took out the stuff from the kids' room and threw it out
[16:52] if you don't believe me then ask your daughter
[16:56] yes dad, mom is absolutely right
[17:06] Fabiha aunty had scolded me as well, also she had ousted me from my room
[17:11] Fabiha?
[17:13] leave it Arham, there is no use of arguing 
[17:21] She is involving the kids so that you can get angry on the kids & then you shall become the bad guy in front of them
[17:26] so please
[17:28] my daughter doesn't lie
[17:30] she doesn't lie, but you are lying
[17:37] and whatever you will tell her, she will speak the same
[17:39] Fabiha!
[17:43] don't shout
[17:52] so what shall I do? Shall I listen to her quietly?
[17:55] just remember one thing, if my baby gets hurt or Fabiha gets hurt then I will not tolerate anything & forget everything
[18:15] enough
[18:22] lets go Fabiha
[18:38] its not that difficult to get burn in the fire of love
[18:41] the more it is to get burn in the fire of hatred
[18:49] the fire has been lit
[18:51] now only a spark is enough
[19:30] have you finished your juice or not?
[19:32] hey, its still there. Come on finish it
[20:22] there is no need to worry a lot
[20:25] drink some water
[20:28] don't think too much about Sanaya, just drink water
[20:33] Try to understand that Sanaya is deliberately trying to annoy us to create misunderstandings between us
[20:41] Thank God everything happened right in front of your eyes, or I would have become the bad guy for no reason
[20:54] just take care of yourself, Ok?
[20:58] You are there to take care of me, so why should I worry?
[21:04] nothing will happen to me or to my baby, Arham
you don't need to be so afraid
[21:18] I cannot leave you at your mom's place either, as she is still upset
[21:23] Even if she hadn't been upset, would I have left you alone and gone to her?
[21:26] No, right?
[21:30] who else do I have except for you?
[21:39] Fabiha, I was scared
[21:41] you don't need to be afraid at all
[21:46] you have warned Sanaya, right?
It won't happen again
[21:49] Even if it happened, I cannot go to my mom's house, but Sanaya can
[21:54] send her
[21:58] but don't think too much about it, ok?
[22:09] anyways, lets go to the doctor for my satisfaction
[22:11] we'll get your check up done, then we'll go for a dinner
[22:14] Ok
[22:52] just remember one thing, if my baby gets hurt or Fabiha gets hurt then I will not tolerate anything & forget everything
[23:11] its not that difficult to get burn in the fire of love
[23:14] the more it is to get burn in the fire of hatred
[23:21] the fire has been lit
[23:23] now only a spark is enough
[26:00] what is this Hamza, you always bring me to the same restaurant. Why don't you take me to some new place?
[26:07] Fabiha, that day is not far when we'll go to some nice restaurant in our own car
[26:15] just promise me that you'll always stand by my side
[26:19] I promise that I will stay with you
[26:27] happy birthday Fabiha
[26:33] today I have everything, a lot of money... a car
[26:39] only you are not there
[26:45] I wish you had shown some patience
[26:54] happy birthday to you
[26:58] happy birthday to you
[27:02] happy birthday Fabiha
[27:23] don't open your eyes, no cheating
[27:24] what are you doing, Arham?
[27:26] just give me one minute
[27:28] watch, there are stairs
[27:31] there are stairs... very nice
[27:34] there you go, that's it!
[27:39] here...
[27:42] happy birthday!
[27:44] is this for me?
[27:45] yes, come
[27:47] how's the surprise?
[27:48] very nice, thank you so much
[27:56] happy birthday, Fabiha
[27:58] thank you, Arham
[27:59] I never thought anyone would plan a surprise for me
[28:04] I am here
[28:06] I love you!
[28:07] I love you more. Come on
[28:49] oh my God!
[28:52] happy anniversary
[28:53] happy anniversary
[28:56] lets cut the cake & celebrate
[28:59] Wow!
[29:06] thank you Arham, thank you so much
[29:26] Arham?
[29:28] yes
[29:29] cut the cake
[29:31] happy birthday to you
give me, let me do it
[30:31] Fabiha
[31:41] greetings mom!
[31:44] I thought to participate in my daughter's happiness
[31:51] Happy Anniversary, Sanaya
[31:56] When the person with whom my happiness was associated is not with me then...
[32:04] I don't feel happiness by someone's words, mom
[32:11] I am drowned in the sea of my love
[32:15] where is Arham?
[32:18] the place where he should be
[32:23] While fulfilling his own incomplete happiness, he is also fulfilling her desires
[32:32] he doesn't care about me
[32:40] people tell lies...
[32:42] that nobody can take the place of the first wife
[32:49] She has taken possession of everything in this house, along with Arham
[32:59] Now, Arham's comeback is impossible mom
[33:04] being a mother, I will never ask you to leave everything & come back
[33:16] its a difficult time, it will be over soon
[33:23] I just pray to God that he shall bless you with happiness
[33:29] even if the happiness comes back into my life, mom
[33:36] but the lost Sanaya can never come back
[33:44] The pain I have been through can never lessen
[33:52] I might get Arham back
[34:00] When a woman's self-respect is tarnished, she is left only with her breaths to live with
[34:12] then time, companionship, love, justice...
[34:17] nothing is required
[34:21] I know my dear
[34:26] but what to do, I have to give you some courage too
[34:34] never hope for the justice
[34:38] understand?
[34:43] A man can never do justice, mom
[34:50] He can get married four times, but he cannot fulfill the rights of any one woman
[34:59] so how will he answer about the rights of all the four women
[35:35] ok mom, I will talk to you later. Bye!
[35:39] Bye!
[36:12] Arham, why did you stop?
[36:19] nothing, lets go
[36:48] who came at this hour?
[36:50] coming...
[36:53] who is it?
[36:58] Hamza! you are here & that too so late night
[37:06] is everything ok?
[37:08] okay, come inside
[37:11] come
[37:14] is everything alright?
[37:16] you seem worried to me
[37:18] what happened?
[37:23] Hamza, how come you got injured?
[37:28] Hamza?
[37:30] Okay, come sit. Let me bring bandaid for you
[37:34] sit down
[38:01] this...
[38:04] Hamza, tell me something. What happened
[38:22] I am asking you something, Hamza
[38:31] Look, if you tell me, it might lessen the burden on your heart
[38:48] I had gone to Fabiha's favorite restaurant
[38:54] I thought about going there with her sometime
[39:03] But it was written in my fate that I would go there and see her with someone else
[39:15] she was celebrating her birthday with Arham
[39:29] did you mind it?
[39:37] Hamza, shall I give you a suggestion?
[39:46] if you ever go to that place next time
[39:48] then take someone with you
[39:59] so that you don't feel lonely
[40:12] now don't say that I shall find a girl for you
