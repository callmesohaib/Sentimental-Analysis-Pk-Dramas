[00:13] I do remember all your favors
[00:16] but those favors doesn't mean that you shall forget your limit
[00:20]  I am not your wife, Hamza
[00:22] neither you have any right on me
[00:25]  therefore, its better for you to remember your value before imposing your right on me
[00:29] It seems as if she has breathed life into the people of this house
[00:35] See how she has handled the house; it doesn't seem like Sanaya is not here
[00:40]  Arham, the actual thing is that
[00:43] Only that person is important whose absence shatters everything
[00:48] Nothing has changed due to Sanaya's absence 
[00:51] everyone is happy 
[00:53] the kids, you & me as well
[02:03] you haven't slept as of yet?
[02:08] Have the kids gone to sleep?
[02:09] yes, I have made them go to sleep
[02:12] Okay
[02:13] Great!
[02:15] Do you know, yesterday it took me three hours to get them to sleep
[02:18] And you made them go to sleep within ten minutes
[02:22] Don't know, maybe they have become more attached to me
[02:25] maybe
[02:30] Fabiha, can I ask you a question if you don't mind
[02:35] yes, go ahead
[02:38] actually... 
[02:40] you went quiet while talking about Hamza
[02:43] I didn't wanted to force you yesterday as well
[02:48] what do you want to know about him?
[02:52] that are you happy with him or not?
[02:56] a forceful relation isn't nurtured but dragged
[02:59] and I am just doing that
[03:01] forceful relation?
[03:03] my mother thinks that Hamza is such a nice guy, and he will always keep me happy
[03:10] now tell me, a guy who is dependent on me. Who have all the hopes from me
[03:16] how will he fulfill my desires?
[03:21] now he has become the reason of my embarrassment as well
[03:23] I am unable to face Ma'am Sanaya since he committed embezzlement in his office
[03:29] just think, how can I come the respect of that guy who doesn't have his own respect?
[03:36] and now he wants me to repay his loan too
[03:39] never do that
[03:42] if you will do this then... 
[03:44] he will become habitual
whenever he will get stuck in any problem then he will... 
[03:49] I am a man, and I know what is a man's nature
[03:55] Yesterday, when I went home, he was sitting with my mom and complaining about me
[03:58] what!
[04:00] I used to get humiliated in my house every day because of him
[04:05] mom think that he is my protector
[04:08] but a father, brother or a husband is the protector
[04:13] If there is a protector, then all the fears are set aside within ourselves
[04:18] a person becomes free from all the fears
[04:21] but I have never felt like that with Hamza
[04:28] and nobody cares about my feelings
[07:46] yes Fabiha, what happened?
[07:48] Sorry to disturb you
[07:49] Your phone was lying in the lounge, so I thought to give it to you
[07:53] thank you!
[07:59] are you fine?
[08:01] yes yes, I am okay
[08:03] sit down
[08:09] you are having such a high fever
[08:11] Rest for a while, meanwhile let me prepare some tea for you
[08:13] No no please, I don't want to drink any tea
[08:16] I'm telling you, you need to drink it. Take some rest, meanwhile let me bring it for you
[08:19] but Fabiha... 
[08:20] I am bringing it
[08:31] Okay, please let me know what time your next flight to Karachi is
[08:37] Okay please. Put me on the next flight. Ok?
[08:41] thank you!
[08:49] No no... no!
[09:16] hello! yes mom?
[09:18] what's the matter, you haven't slept as of yet?
[09:21] yes actually, I was making tea for aunty
[09:25] ok listen... 
[09:27] at what time you'll come back tomorrow?
[09:28] I will come back on my time
[09:32] Okay
[09:33] today you've stayed there upon her insistence, but if she asks you to stay there tomorrow then refuse her
[09:38] otherwise, I will refuse her myself
[09:40] okay mom, I will tell her. Don't worry
[09:43] Hang up now, as I need to take the tea to her
[09:45] Okay, bye!
and listen!
[09:48] take very good care of yourself
[09:51] do close the doors properly & stay in your senses. Ok?
[09:55] mom, why are you getting worried?
[09:58] how can I not worry, dear?
[10:00] You've gone for the first time without Hamza
[10:03] its obvious that my heart will feel worried
[10:05] Ok fine, hang up the call now as I need to serve the tea
[10:09] Bye!
[10:10] Bye!
[11:02] okay mom, drink your milk now
[11:05] then you need to take your medicines as well
[11:10] what's wrong, mom?
[11:13] why you seem so upset since you came back from Sanaya's house?
[11:17] yes, I am so worried & my heart is feeling so anxious
[11:20] look, Sanaya did such a big stupidity!
[11:23] She has handed over her entire house to that caretaker before going to Islamabad
[11:29] Her staying there alone is startling in my eyes
[11:34] mom.... Sanaya isn't a kid
[11:38] She knows what's right & what's wrong
[11:42] As it is, we trust that person whom we had tested already
[11:46] We cannot realize anyone's intentions within a few times
[11:50] It's only been a few days since the girl came into that house, and my daughter had handed over her entire house to her
[11:57] To the extent that she has handed over all the responsibilities of Arham's to her
[12:02] There isn't a chance of a single mistake in the relation between a husband and wife
[12:09] the husband is also a man
[12:11] the brother is also a man
[12:13] a man never changes his nature
[12:16] mom, you are over-thinking. Don't worry a lot
[12:22] why shall I not be worried?
[12:24] If something wrong happens by mistake, then they'll regret it for a lifetime
[12:32] leave it mom, please don't take tension
[12:35] being a woman, I am a mother as well
[12:40] A mother gets to know whenever any problem may occur with her children
[12:46] and she tries her level best to take out her children from that problem
[12:51] Okay
[12:52] now drink your milk
[12:54] and don't fall sick, Okay
[15:39] hey!
[15:41] Did you wake up?
[15:45] yes
[15:48] you don't have fever anymore
[15:53] You had been here on the sofa the entire night?
[15:56] actually you were having very high fever, so I didn't find it right to leave you alone
[16:01] and Fabiha, you did all this?
[16:05] yes
[16:09] thank you!
[16:11] for what?
[16:13] for taking care of me
[16:17] it was my duty based upon humanity
[16:20] and I've just fulfilled my duty
[16:23] do some rest
[16:45] hey Hamza!
[16:48] are you waiting for Fabiha?
[16:51] don't waste your time, as she is not at home
[16:56] has she started to go early?
[16:58] yes! and she comes back late night
[17:02] in fact, sometimes she had to stay there
[17:06] even yesterday, she had stayed there in an emergency
[17:08] why?
[17:10] what as such was the emergency?
[17:14] God knows! She was saying that her Arham sir & maam, both have gone to Islamabad
[17:23] Hamza, honestly speaking. Please leave her alone for a few days
[17:28] I cannot leave her
[17:30] this heart starts beating from Fabiha
[17:33] and ends on her
[17:36] don't destroy yourself like this
[17:39] Okay, leave this topic. Hamza, why don't you find some good job for yourself?
[17:44] try to come to Fabiha's standards
[17:49] if you say so, then shall I try to talk about your job?
[17:57] Okay, I will talk to them today
[18:00] Anyways, I am getting late. I am leaving, ok?
[18:04] Farheen
[18:06] let me drop you
[18:08] No no, there is no need of it. I will go myself
[18:11] No no, please sit. Let me drop you
[19:39] Why do you seem so scared after looking at me?
[19:42] Sanaya, you've been away from me for 2 days, and now you can see fear on my face
[19:48] You have no idea about the fear that is consuming my heart right now
[19:55] what are you saying, what do you mean by all this?
[19:57] With whom were you yesterday?
[20:08] Good morning! What's up?
[20:11] Fabiha aunty is making sandwich for me
[20:14] really? And what is Hadi eating?
[20:18] Hadi is not eating anything, his mood is off
[20:22] Why? What happened to my prince, why he doesn't want to eat?
[20:25] He is saying that mom hasn't called even once since she left
[20:30] that's why I am angry with mom
[20:34] its not like that
[20:36] Your mom called last night, but you were asleep. That's why I didn't wake you up
[20:39] but now I am awake, so call her now
[20:42] yes, that's also fine
[20:44] Hareem, go bring my phone from my room. Its on the charging
[20:47] let me do it right away, finish your milk first
[20:57] here you go, dad
[20:58] thank you so much!
you're welcome
[21:06] drink your milk
[21:07] yes
[21:09] what happened?
[21:11] your mom's phone is off, lets try again
[21:14] she will pick it
[21:39] what happened, what have you done?
[21:41] get up, leave it
[21:44] be careful, come with me
[21:47] you should have been careful while cutting. Please sit
[21:53] Fabiha aunty is bleeding a lot
[22:00] You should have been careful while cutting
[22:09] its okay
[22:10] trust me
[22:14] Fabiha aunty is getting scared like kids
[22:26] hold it
[22:33] dad, try calling mom
[22:36] yes! Her phone is off right now, lets try again
[22:42] you guys haven't finished your milk
[22:45] let me bring the sandwich. Ok?
[22:57] You're calling after so many days, is everything fine?
[23:01] What can I say! It's been difficult to stay in Dubai
[23:04] We came to Dubai from Pakistan so that we could get rid of our in-laws and their responsibilities
[23:09] but it has become a big punishment
[23:11] Why?
[23:12] What happened now?
[23:15] My mother-in-law's nephew is getting married, so his entire wedding shopping will be done in Dubai
[23:20] So that the gifts will have Dubai's tag on them
[23:23] if I will refuse my mother-in-law, then her moods get off
[23:26] big issue!
[23:28] By giving her son to the daughter-in-law, she thinks that she has acquired someone's daughter
[23:31] there is no need to take her tantrums, just clearly refuse Sameer
[23:36] what do you think, I wouldn't have refused?
I did
[23:39] but my husband, he comes a puppet in front of his mother's orders
[23:43] what is this Hadia, you couldn't control your husband in so many years
[23:47] Look at Sanaya, how she makes Arham dance on her finger tips
[23:52] By the way, Mom, it's such a false statement that the way to a man's heart goes through his stomach
[23:57] I've become tired of cooking food
[23:59] If a woman is working like Sister Sanaya, then she can shut her husband's mouth with her earnings
[24:05] Her earnings have shut our brother's mouth and also filled his stomach too
[24:10] by the way, where is she?
[24:11] She has got moles on her feet now, they don't let her stay at home
[24:16] She has gone to Islamabad for an outing, making an excuse of office
[24:20] She has gone to Islamabad?
[24:22] this is great
[24:24] Brother Arham and the kids have also gone? Are you alone again?
[24:28] No, if she had taken them, then who would she have left me with?
[24:33] hmm... even I was thinking the same. The kids must have annoyed you a lot
[24:37] No no, not much. Yesterday night they were a bit uncomfortable
[24:42] Also, they had irritated me a bit, that's why I asked Fabiha to stay overnight
[24:46] It's good, this way it will become easier for Arham to distance himself from Sanaya
[24:51] hmm... by the way mom, may I say something? I don't find Fabiha any less
[24:56] don't trust her blindly
[24:59] She is also an independent bird, what if she takes your son away somewhere?
[25:02] No, your mother is not that bad player though
[25:06] I've spent my entire life, and I've made this decision based upon my life's experiences
[25:14] sometimes, the decisions gets into trouble
[25:18] don't worry about it
[25:20] I know how to handle this matter
[25:23] tell me, when is the wedding?
[25:26] the wedding is after 2 weeks
[25:28] then you are coming, right?
[25:30] I will come, but Mom, please ensure that Sister Sanaya's relatives don't visit in my presence. Please.
[25:36] yes yes, fine. They cannot dare to come
[26:20] what happened to your hand?
[26:21] nothing Hamza, go away from here
[26:25] I haven't come to go away, Fabiha!
[26:27] what's wrong with you, Fabiha? Why are you ignoring me?
[26:31] you came here to ask this?
[26:33] No!
[26:34] But the matter I want to discuss, I cannot do it while standing here
[26:37] therefore, you need to come with me right away for some time
[26:41] have you gone mad? How can I go with you right now?
[26:43] You've been here since last night. It won't be a big deal if you come with me for some time
[26:49] come
[26:50] Hamza, what is this misbehavior? Leave my hand
[26:52] Fabiha, I said I need to discuss an important matter with you
[26:54] Enough is enough Fabiha! come with me
[26:56] Hamza, why are you forcing me?
[26:57] I can force you because...
leave her hand!
[27:01] if she doesn't want to go with you, then why are you forcing her?
[27:04] who are you to interfere in our matter?
[27:06] This matter concerns Fabiha and me; you stay out of it!
[27:09] What!
[27:11] leave her hand
[27:12] Hamza, go away from here & don't misbehave
[27:16] there is no need to create any drama here. Go away
I will talk to you later
[27:19] Hamza, go away from here
[27:42] thank you, Arham
[27:45] and sorry for the disturbance
[27:56] sometimes she had to stay there
[28:00] even yesterday, she had stayed there in an emergency
[28:02] why?
[28:03] God knows! She was saying that her Arham sir & maam, both have gone to Islamabad
[28:12] If Arham is here
[28:14] Then why did Fabiha tell Farheen that Arham had also gone?
[28:19] Farheen is definitely lying!
[30:15] mom...
[30:17] mom is here, yaay!
mom..
[30:32] mom, you didn't call me
[30:34] I was busy
[30:35] mom, where is my Elsa?
[30:37] its in the luggage, ok?
[30:38] yes!
[30:39] Fabiha, take the kids to their room
[30:43] come on, I am coming in a while
[30:53] You said you'd come within 3 days, so why now all of a sudden?
[30:59] what?
[31:01] what happened?
[31:02] can't I give you a surprise?
[31:05] you can, you can give it for sure
[31:09] Why do you seem so scared after looking at me?
[31:13] Sanaya, you've been away from me for 2 days, and now you can see fear on my face
[31:19] You have no idea about the fear that is consuming my heart right now
[31:25] what are you saying, what do you mean by all this?
[31:28] With whom were you yesterday?
[31:37] Call Asad
[31:41] Sanaya, you have never behaved in this manner ever then why today?
[31:44] Because before today, you had never lied to me
[31:55] this is the reason of your lie!
[32:08] by telling about Emaan & Asad
[32:10] Which girl were you with?
[32:17] I have asked you something, who is this girl?
[32:21] Sanaya, you trust the picture sent by Sambreen more than me?
[32:26] if somebody will say something in the future, so will you believe them?
[32:28] I am compelled to believe whatever I can see in this picture right now
[32:40] then, will you believe on whatever I will tell you?
[32:47] its Fabiha in this picture
[32:55] Fabiha!
[32:56] yes
[33:03] the kids were insisting to go to the play area
[33:06] and they were insisting that they'll go with Fabiha
[33:10] So, you could have told me this yesterday as well. Why did you lie to me or hide this matter?
[33:13] I could have told you
[33:15] I could have told you for sure. But I know one thing that you are woman
[33:20] A man isn't scared of anything except for a woman's doubt
[33:27] I thought, since you are away from me
[33:30] So if I tell you this, you might misunderstand.
[33:36] but I am disappointed
[33:38] I was being careful towards you, Sanaya
[33:41] I was thinking about you. I planned to tell you when you would come in front of me. But, no
[33:45] And Sanaya, you still couldn't understand me even after living with me for so many years
[33:49] I am disappointed on this
[33:54] Arham... I
[33:56] Arham, I am really sorry
please please...
[33:58] I didn't believe it, but my heart felt so restless when I saw that picture
[34:03] I am really sorry. Since I was away from you....
[34:06] maybe that's why I was being so possessive. I am really sorry Arham
[34:09] Sanaya, there's a big difference between being possessive and being doubtful
[34:14] The doubt that you've had on my love for you is such a big insult
[34:21] therefore, keep your phone with you
[35:26] Greetings mom!
Greetings!
[35:29] How come you came so early today?
[35:30] Mom, I am not feeling well today, so I took an early leave
[35:34] Can you please make me a cup of tea? Meanwhile, I'll change my clothes
[35:38] yes yes, let me prepare it
[35:40] Why did you say that Arham had gone to Islamabad?
[35:44] because Fabiha had told us the same thing
[35:47] really?
[35:49] Aunty, tell me, did Fabiha say any such thing to you?
[35:58] Why are you sitting quietly? 
Tell Hamza that Fabiha told us the same thing
[36:02] Stop it, Farheen! How much more will you lie?
[36:05] haven't you gone mad? Why will I lie to you?
[36:08] because you want to create misunderstandings between me & Fabiha
[36:12] You were sure that when you will tell this to me, I would go to Fabiha.
[36:15] and there, Arham's presence would prove her wrong.
[36:21] there is a limit of being shameless, Farheen
[36:23] I don't know why are you doing all this
[36:25] But if you think that this way you'll create distance between Fabiha and me, then it's your delusion
[36:31] Understand!
[36:43] You had never stayed quiet like this for me in front of Haris
[36:46] In fact, you had tried your level best to make us fight
[36:49] Then why is Hamza so special? Why didn't you tell him the truth?
[36:53] You've already said everything in front of him.
 What was the need to utter so much rubbish in front of Hamza?
[36:58] why all of you are after this relation?
[37:02] we don't tell everything to the in-laws
[37:05] as far as Haris is concerned, then don't you dare to take his name
[37:09] get back to your senses!
[37:12] He didn't leave a chance to humiliate you
[37:15] If he had been like Hamza, who would have supported me in every condition, then it would have mattered
[37:20] And Fabiha! Let her come, then I will teach her a lesso
[37:24] this girl is flying too high
[37:26] and listen!
[37:27] Do lock the door after entering the house. Just now, Hamza came. What if the robbers enter next time? Go!
[37:53] I saw you were worried, so I brought some water for you. Please drink it
[38:01] by the way, I shouldn't be asking but what's the matter?
[38:05] why are you worried?
[38:08] I made a mistake
[38:11] I shouldn't have doubted Arham
[38:18] Don't know why I believed Sambreen's words
[38:23] this is the biggest problem of a woman
[38:26] she starts doubting
[38:30] Even with anger or misbehavior in the relationship, it can still remain strong
[38:36] But as soon as doubts arise, the relationship breaks
[38:41] And the good thing is that Sir Arham ended the entire matter with just anger
[38:47] and the person who loves you, gets angry
[38:50] If I had a sister, she would have been explaining to me in the same manner now
[38:55] thank you!
[38:57] your trust is sir Arham's belief
[39:01] And if your trust breaks, then his belief will also break
[39:06] And when belief breaks, then a person breaks and shatters
[39:13] it won't happen
[39:20] and I am waiting for Arham to break
[39:23] the day it will happen
[39:25] I will handle him
