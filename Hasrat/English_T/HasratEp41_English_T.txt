[01:24] You seem tired. Was there a lot of work? 
 Yes we have an assignment deadline. Its the workload.
[01:38] You must be thinking that ever since you came, we've been having problems and worries.
[01:48] And you didn't get anything you deserved. 
 What is it about me, Arham?
[01:55] I was living with desires earlier and I'll do that now as well. I just don't want you worried. 
 Fabiha, I promise I'll fulfill all your wishes.
[02:05] For me, you are important, not my desires. 
 I had all my hopes pinned on Sanaya but she didn't support me.
[02:16] You have made a place for yourself in this house and in my heart by supporting me in this bad time. But maybe even you,
[02:25] might be thinking I'm nothing without Sanaya. 
 Its not like that Arham. This self depreciation is instilled in you by Sanaya.
[02:35] And you're thinking you're weak by believing it. If a woman earns more, she makes her man, weak.
[02:46] But you're not weak. Believe in your power and use it. 
 I'll never be weak if you're with me.
[02:57] I'm with you and I'll always be with you.
[03:04] Did you talk to Sanaya about the plot? 
 I'll do it today. Can you make me a cup of coffee? I'm too tired. I'll go change.
[03:14] I'll go make it.
[03:20] Hello mom. What happened? Aren't you ready? We have to go to Sanaya's house. 
 I'm not feeling well.
[03:28] I feel my blood pressure is high. When we checked, it was 190/110. I have high palpitations as well.
[03:39] Your blood pressure is very high. Lets go to the doctor first. 
 I'll be fine. I've just taken the medicine.
[03:50] You're worried about Sanaya. Thats the problem. 
 Sanaya isn't happy Junaid. 
[03:58] Did you talk to her? 
 I called to ask about the kids. I feel she's upset with me and thats what I cannot withstand.
[04:10] She thinks we're not with her. You should go and bring her here for a few days. She'll feel we're all with her then.
[04:21] Of course, we're with her. What are you saying? But if she's trying to adjust in her house, we cannot hold her back.
[04:30] Her husband has married somebody else. She'll be worried and upset and she'll express her disdain as well. But you shouldn't take everything to heart.
[04:42] See we have to handle Sanaya's problem. If you get worried like this, how will we handle it?
[04:51] Hmm.. 
 Mom relax. I'll call her and talk to her. Everything will be alright.
[06:08] What are you doing? Arham what are you looking for? Tell me what you're looking for?
[06:20] Arham, why don't you tell me, what do you want? 
 Sanaya, where is the file for the plot?
[06:29] You're forgetting that we bought the plot for Hareem. 
 I remember everything. Don't remind me. Tell me where is the file.
[06:36] You cannot sell that plot. 
 Where is the file of the plot? Please.
[06:44] Tell me. 
 The file isn't here. 
[06:48] Where is it? 
 Its with brother Junaid. 
[06:52] Tell your brother, I want that file by tonight. Ask him to bring it. 
 Its not only your plot.
[07:01] Wow. This is what you mean. 
 Arham, I didn't mean that. 
[07:08] I know what you mean. Don't say no. Fabiha is right. You kept the plot, the house for bad times.
[07:19] Isn't it? Sanaya.. after looking at everything, I'm not at all upset about being disloyal to you. You deserved all this.
[07:29] A woman like you deserved all this. I lost my mother because of you, Sanaya.
[07:37] I'll not let Fabiha go.
[07:43] And another thing, if I sell this plot, I'll give you your share. And keep it safe. You'll need it.
[08:30] What happened? Did you get the file? 
 No. Its not at home. Its with Sanaya's brother.
[08:37] But don't worry, I told her I need it by tonight. 
 If it belongs to the two of you, why is it with Sanaya's brother?
[08:50] This shows that she never trusted you.
[09:00] Otherwise, why would someone keep their property with someone else?
[09:07] Aunty kept telling me that Sanaya didn't trust her thats why she left her kids with her mother and then portrayed her to be the bad guy.
[09:20] Aunty told me that Sanaya didn't care for her and I never believed her. But aunty was absolutely right.
[09:35] Sanaya didn't you give tea to mom? How could you forget it? 
 I went Arham. Mom said she wanted to sleep so what could I do?
[09:45] Where? When did you come, dear? I didn't know.
[09:55] Take me to the bathroom. Your wife has said no, clearly. 
 Mom, I just brought you out of the bathroom.
[10:08] She's lying. You change your colors like a chameleon once you see your husband.
[10:19] You want to tell me that its my fault, mom is paralyzed. 
 Yes, if you had given the insulin on time..
[10:25] My mother would have been on her feet. She wouldn't be on the bed.
[10:29] Before you accused me of something so big, at least think about it. I didn't..
 Accept it if you made a mistake.
[10:37] She was right. Aunty never got her insulin.
[10:43] Now see for yourself. Aunty was right objecting her job. Its all her benefit.
[10:49] What can you expect from such a selfish woman?
[11:26] Junaid, I've given mom food and medicine.
[11:33] What is this? 
 This is Sanaya's plot file. I'm going to give it back to her. 
[11:39] But why? It is on Hareem's name. 
 Whatever it is, it is hers. I'll have to return when she asks for it.
[11:46] Sanaya didn't ask for it. It must be Arham's doing.
[11:55] Whenever he is in trouble, he remembers this plot. Don't you remember how Sanaya stopped him the last time he wanted to sell this plot?
[12:06] Sanaya kept this file here so that they wouldn't sell it because it won't be there.
[12:13] God knows, what Arham wants.. 
 Whatever it is.. It is their personal matter. What can we say?
[12:20] Junaid, I shouldn't say this but.. see, this isn't the time when,
[12:31] the parents would see their daughter being ridiculed. Its now the time when a girl's family ensures she's strong. 
[12:40] And those who don't, their daughters suffer like Sanaya is. 
 I tried to make Sanaya understand but..
[12:50] She made me quiet. What can I do? 
 I don't know what Arham is made of? Doesn't he know how difficult it is to make all this.
[12:59] You're right. Don't mention this to mom. I'll go right now and I'll be back shortly. Okay?
[13:25] What are you thinking mom? 
 Nothing. 
[13:31] No. There is something. Tell me whats going on in your mind.
[13:39] I've been missing Fabiha for the past few days.
[13:44] Mom.. Fabiha is happy in her house. Don't worry about her. 
 Did you talk to her?
[13:54] Yes. Just for a bit.
[14:00] She could come and apologize.
[14:07] But mom..
[14:11] I was thinking that Hamza is still disturbed and he hasn't forgotten the insult Fabiha threw his way.
[14:24] Imagine if Fabiha apologizes to you and starts coming here again,
[14:33] what if Hamza will dislike it? To think about it, Hamza has helped us a lot.
[14:42] I pray for Hamza. May God bless him with everything he wants. 
 Just pray that Hamza is blessed with happiness once again.
[15:07] What are you looking at? 
 Nothing. Should we go?
[15:17] Where are you lost? Eat.
[15:34] This is your file. 
 You should have brought mom along.
[15:41] Mom isn't well since morning. 
 What happened to mom?
[15:47] She has high blood pressure since morning. 
 Did you take her to the doctor? What did he say?
[15:54] I'll take her tomorrow. Soumya gave her medicine and made her sleep. Just pray she gets better.
[16:02] I wanted to come see you. This file is just an excuse.
[16:10] I wanted to talk to you. 
 What is it? Is everything alright?
[16:15] See.. I am talking to you as your elder brother.
[16:20] Don't mind me. I know you're going through a lot right now and its not easy to face everything.
[16:31] All your hatred, your frustration, everything is legit. I understand.
[16:39] See, how strongly you're going through everything for the sake of your children.
[16:48] But Sanaya.. our mother isn't that strong.
[17:01] I don't think she can withstand your pains anymore.
[17:12] See, I'll again say, don't mind me.
[17:19] Whatever you say, it affects her mind. She worries for you day and night.
[17:27] If you want to talk, talk to Soumya or me. I know you..
[17:35] must be thinking that I'm only thinking about myself or my house but trust me I'm thinking about our mother.
[17:46] Mom loves you a lot. But you know without mom..
[17:55] What will happen to me?
[18:02] I'm scared, that worrying for you, she might..
[18:08] what if something happens to her.. 
 God forbid.. Nothing will happen to mom, ever.
[18:19] In my worries, I forgot this completely. You're right.
[18:25] Don't worry. I won't talk to mom. But you know, daughters only have their mothers.
[18:37] And the crutch that a mother is.. we can never think we can fall off it.
[18:45] When we share our worries with our mothers and get new courage, daughters once again get ready to bear pain with their in laws.
[18:58] Girls are very strong but I won't talk to mom again. I'll be careful.
[19:13] I know you're very sensible and I expected you to be this smart.
[19:22] But if you still mind something, I'm sorry. 
 I swear I didn't mind anything. If Soumya had said it, I might have been offended but you..
[19:33] You said everything clearly. I didn't mind anything. This is the difference in relationships. If someone understands.
[19:42] You do know, your brother is always with you.
[19:50] I'll leave now. Take care. 
 Thank you brother.
[21:10] Nobody can take Fabiha's place.
[21:16] Hamza, Fabiha's chapter is closed now. She has moved on in life. Please, you move on as well.
[21:34] Here's your coffee.. 
 Thank you.
[21:40] I see you've changed for the better now. 
 Like?
[21:47] Like you are thinking about a beloved and someone drags you out of those thoughts.
[22:00] And then you leave those thoughts in the past and come back to the present.
[22:08] Its this change that I see in you and I'm very satisfied and happy to see this change.
[22:20] I'm watching that my sister is now getting all the more clever. She can immediately guess whats going on in my heart.
[22:27] Of course this is so. I used to think Farheen was different from Fabiha and very ill mannered.
[22:36] But after meeting her I found out that she's very sympathetic and good natured.
[22:41] I can challenge you. If Farheen had been in Fabiha's place, she would never have deceived you.
[23:50] Don't worry. The file is in the right hands now.
[23:56] I have to talk to Arham. 
 You'll have to wait to talk to Arham. Its best if you don't disturb our privacy.
[24:04] I'm here to talk to my husband, Fabiha. 
 Right now I'm with my husband and you're forgetting this is my room and my husband.
[24:30] Fabiha, tell her I don't want to talk to her.
[24:34] I don't think you'll be able to hear anything more. And if you keep standing here, Arham will get in a bad mood and I don't want that. Please leave.
[24:45] The plot file.
[24:57] The kids have parent teacher meeting tomorrow and its important for us to go there.
[25:05] I hope you understand and you'll be ready on time.
[25:10] I cannot come. I have a meeting.
[25:18] You know well there is an annual parent teacher meeting and I believe you'll not do anything to tarnish our children's future.
[27:47] Right now I'm with my husband. You're forgetting this is my room and my husband. 
 Fabiha tell her I don't want to talk.
[29:05] It seems you couldn't sleep all night. Even your eyes are swollen and your hopes are breaking.
[29:20] I told you to live peacefully but you liked to eat in a single plate.
[29:31] Now what can one do if the other person doesn't want to understand?
[29:38] See, you need to change with time and circumstances. If you had thought about all this along with earning money, things would have been better.
[29:51] I'll do something in return if you plan to throw me out. I left everything and caught on Arham's weakness.
[30:07] You're his wife and you know his weakness as well.
[30:15] What did you tell me? That Arham has just lost his car and then he'll lose a lot of things and I'll have to suffer. Isn't it?
[30:29] You lost your husband because of your stupidity and I told him to get this plot from you.
[30:39] And we have to take a lot more now. Like this house, the kids and everything else.
[30:51] A woman thinks she's powerful is she has a man with her. Its good that you think the same.
[31:01] But don't think I'm weak.
[31:10] You clashed with a wife but don't dare butt your head against a mother.
[31:26] You won't have any power.
[32:01] Sanaya what happened? 
 I fell down like you but I caught myself.
[32:34] Listen..
[32:44] I'm going to the bank for the meeting. Get the kids ready. 
 Okay.
[32:53] Arham.. your coffee. No matter how late you're getting, I won't let you go without it.
[33:01] Mom said, if you leave for work without food, you won't get the job done.
[33:21] Where are you? You didn't have breakfast?
 I'm getting late Sanaya..
[33:25] You're not getting late. Don't you remember what mom said? If you leave on an empty stomach, you won't get anything done. Just one sip from my hand.
[33:35] Good boy. One more.. 
 Alright. I'm getting late. 
[33:39] Have a good day.  Bye..
[33:50] I'm getting late. Thanks for the coffee.
[34:14] This is mine. This is mine. Hadi..
[34:21] This is mine. Its mine.. 
 Whats going on? Enough.
[34:28] You've played a lot. Get up. You have a shower. You haven't even changed. Dad is coming. We have to go to school. 
[34:36] Is dad coming with us? 
 Why are you asking this question?
[34:42] Just like that. Ever since Fabiha aunty came in our house, dad doesn't sleep with us or take us out.
[34:57] Its not that dear, dad is coming with us. Come on get ready. 
 Alright. Now I'll show dad my senior class.
[35:06] And mom? 
 You and dad aren't different.
[35:12] You talk a lot. Who taught you all this? 
 Nobody did.
[35:20] Now Fabiha aunty doesn't even talk to us.
[35:31] You have talked a lot. Get up and get ready. If dad doesn't find us ready, he'll be upset. Now hurry up.
[35:39] Good boy. Be careful.
[35:59] Hadi? Hurry with your breakfast. 
 Are you done with your breakfast?
[36:04] Yay.. dad is here. 
 Of course. Lets go. My lion. Lets go.
[36:12] Lets go Sanaya. Lets go. Where is the school bag?
[36:18] Arham.. 
 What happened? What happened to you?
[36:24] Are you okay?
[36:30] Nothing. I felt dizzy. 
 What do you mean? Lets go to the doctor.
[36:38] You go with the kids. I'll be fine if I rest. 
 The kids will go with Sanaya. Its okay.
[36:46] I told you. You're more important. We have to go to the doctor. Sanaya please, take the kids.
[36:56] You know she's sick. Its important to take her to the doctor.
[37:02] Come on..
[37:06] Mom.. Dad has left with Fabiha aunty.. 
 Dear, Fabiha aunty wasn't well. Dad took her to the hospital. Lets go now.
[37:19] Is Fabiha aunty more important? 
 Everybody's dad will be here and not mine. I'll feel so guilty.
[37:30] Mom is with you. Why the embarrassment? Wear your bag. If we get late, our teacher will be upset.
[37:40] And I'll do one thing. I'll call dad. He'll come to the school directly from the hospital. Come on now. 
 Okay mom..
[37:58] I felt dizzy at that time. Thats it. 
 You don't feel dizzy without a reason.
[38:08] Why are you scared? We're just visiting a doctor. 
 I'm not scared. Nothing has happened to me. Why see a doctor?
[38:16] We need to. Be quiet. Its good to get you checked. Its our family doctor. He'll tell us.
[38:25] I don't want to take any risk where you are concerned.
[38:38] Where your husband, Sanaya? 
 I'm sorry mam. He had an important meeting. He won't be able to join.
[38:47] See, you know our school rules. Its important for both parents to be here. 
 I know madam.
[38:55] Do you know how much parent ignorance can disturb children? Do you have any idea?
