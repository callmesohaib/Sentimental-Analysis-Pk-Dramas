[00:13] I don't want to be weighed down all my life. I want to live a good life.
[00:17] I don't want to suffocate to death, be gone.
[00:22] I will die without you.
[00:26] Then die, but please let me be.
[00:30] It wasn't my mistake, whatever that happened was unintentional. I didn't want this.
[00:35] I swear on your life.
[00:37] People who swear are liars.
[00:44] And I might have believed your lie, if I hadn't seen it myself.
[00:47] But now, I don't trust or your words.
Try to understand...
[00:53] I cannot live without you...
You will have to Arhum!
[01:07] You called me mother?
Sit down.
[01:19] What did Fabiha talk about?
[01:23] Do you know anything about what happened?
[01:26] Nothing special... she was saying that she wasn't feeling well.
[01:33] But, she has said something to Hamza. He left without having tea.
[01:39] I tried stopping, but he didn't listen.
[01:45] What must she have said?
[01:48] I don't know anything about that, but..
[01:52] whatever she said, Hamza didn't like it.
[01:58] Mother...
[02:00] What if Fabiha...
[02:04] ended the relationship with Hamza?
[02:11] Why don't you ask her yourself?
[02:14] Where's Fabiha?
She's sleeping right now. She was tired.
[02:21] Alright, I'll talk to her in the morning.
[02:26] Sure.
[02:49] Hadia, when you did you get here?
[02:53] An hour ago. When I arrived mother was alone at home.
[02:58] You weren't here, neither your wife. Where is everyone?
[03:01] I dropped Shenaya at her mother's house.
[03:04] Did you drop her, or did she leave?
[03:12] No.
[03:13] Mother has told me everything, no need to lie to me.
[03:19] Brother, I thought that you loved sister-in-law so much...
[03:24] that you would never think of cheating on her. But you have rendered me and mother wordless.
[03:32] You have proved us wrong.
[03:35] For once you didn't thing what my in-laws and our extended family would think about this once they find out.
[03:42] How do you think that she is worthy of being the daughter-in-law of our family?
[03:49] She's not even worthy of sitting with us.
[03:52] How could you let her fool you like this?
[03:56] Can't you see... can't you understand that she's using you.
[04:00] She's using you to fulfill her dream and desires. I don't know how you allowed yourself to be manipulated by her.
[04:06] Hania, I wasn't manipulated by anyone.
[04:08] I wasn't manipulated.
[08:08] Seeing your impatience and desire, I never thought that you would give up this easy.
[08:17] I haven't given up.
[08:20] Then what is the reason for your silence?
[08:27] If I was in your place, I would have accounted for every word that was said to me.
[08:35] Fabiha look, Arhum expressed his love to you.
[08:41] That is not a small thing.
[08:43] And if he's abandoning this love because of his wife...
[08:48] then that means he is defaming your character.
[08:57] I told you...
[08:59] men are meant to be disloyal.
[09:03] He wasn't loyal to his wife, then how could he be loyal to you?
[09:11] But...
[09:13] You don't have any respect left..
[09:18] neither a job, nor Arhum.
[09:25] You left Hamza a long time ago.
[09:57] Mother provide me with your medicine slip, I'll buy it on my way home.
[10:06] Shenaya... Somia told me that Arhum was here to take you away yesterday.
[10:17] Yes... hurry up and finish your breakfast.
[10:20] Greetings*
[10:25] Good morning princess.
You made a very bad decision.
[10:29] You should have gone with him.
[10:36] Mother...
One shouldn't make one's husband work so hard..
[10:42] If he had forgotten everything to take you back, then you should have gone there.
[10:46] You should have forgiven him. If not for yourself, then for the kids.
[10:56] What effect will this have on the kids?
[11:02] It's not about being harsh... it's about trust.
[11:07] A relationship between husband and wife is made on trust. If trust isn't there then there's nothing left.
[11:14] Shenaya, if a man acknowledges his mistake, then would shouldn't drag it further.
[11:21] If Arhum came for you, then you should have gone with him.
[11:25] What Shenaya did was absolutely right...
[11:30] What hasn't Shenaya done for him? She took care of his home, dropped her kids with you and pursued her career.
[11:38] She has a right for the loyalty she showed.
He was loyal that's why he came, if it were another man he wouldn't have.
[11:47] Brother please don't argue with each other because of me.
You've always had a problem with Arhum.
[11:54] I'm not supporting Shenaya because I have a problem with Arhum.
[12:00] Rather, I am supporting her because I know how a man's cheating affects a woman.
[12:34] Finish up your breakfast my dear. Finish your juice. Good girl.
[12:47] Mother... your breakfast.
[12:51] Did Fabiha leave early today?
[12:54] No... she's sleeping inside.
[12:57] She's sleeping?
[13:00] Fabiha...
[13:03] Fabiha! Fabiha get up!
[13:10] Fabiha... why don't you tell mother the truth?
[13:14] Mother... your daughter has lost her job.
[13:20] Why?
[13:22] You should ask her that.
Come outside... tell me why you lost your job.
[13:31] So what if it has ended. I can't provide you a reason for everything.
[13:35] That's great then... we'll prepare for you wedding now.
[13:40] I'll ask Hamza to finalize the date.
Why do you guys keep mentioning my marriage?
[13:45] Who told you that I want to marry Hamza?
What kind of tone are you speaking to me in?
[13:49] Have you no shame talking to me like that?
[13:52] Listen to me with open ears... I've explained it to Hamza, and you guys should understand it as well.
[13:58] I will not marry Hamza... I don't want to be associated with him.
[14:07] I need a palace to breathe in... no a hut to suffocate in.
[14:40] What did she just say?
[14:46] Mother have your breakfast... Hamza is here...
[14:50] I'm going to work.
What breakfast?
[14:55] My life has been ruined.
[15:01] Farewell*
[15:29] I told you...
[15:32] All men are disloyal.
[15:36] He wasn't loyal to his wife, then why would he have been loyal to you?
[15:50] Arhum left without having breakfast?
Yes.
[15:57] Did he say anything? Did you guys talk again after yesterday?
[16:01] I talked to him.
[16:04] He realizes his mistake, so don't worry. He won't do anything.
[16:11] Alright.
[16:13] How did you find out? Did he say something in the morning?
[16:19] Brother said nothing, but I said a lot of bad things about Fabiha.
[16:24] And brother listened silently, like it made no difference to him
[16:29] But yes... sister-in-law leaving has made a difference on him. And the shame on his face was a testament to that.
[16:38] That's why I'm sure he won't do anything, don't worry.
[16:47] My worries will end...
[16:52] when Shenaya come back home.
[16:55] She will come back, don't worry.
[16:59] Just take care of your health.
[17:05] I've not been well since last night.
[17:10] You didn't tell me...
I feel dizzy.
[17:16] I don't know what to do.
[17:20] Did you take your insulin?
[17:24] I don't know the difference between day and night. I don't know whether I've taken it or not.
[17:32] Mother wait... I'll be right back.
[17:36] Granny please don't cry.
[17:39] I won't cry... I'm worried because of your uncle.
[18:11] I want to meet Arhum.
[18:15] What's your name?
[18:19] Aiman...
Okay.
[18:24] Sir, there is someone named Aiman who wants to meet you.
[18:30] Take a left, it's the first room on the right.
[18:37] Come in.
[18:40] What are you doing here?
[18:43] Shouldn't I have come?
This is not the place, we'll talk later.
[18:48] Whatever we'll talk about we'll talk about right now.
This is my office.
[18:52] What were you thinking when you said it? Am I toy that you can wind up and express your love to whenever you want?
[19:02] Am I a joke to you? Am I someone who you look to when you are bored?
[19:08] What did you gain by doing all this? I've lost everything because of you.
[19:14] Look at me... the person who advised me to leave Hamza can't even look me in the eye anymore.
[19:22] When you didn't want to be with me, then why did you give me that advise?
[19:27] Am I the only one you couldn't have found?
[19:31] Fabiha listen to me...
What should I listen to?
[19:34] Because of you my respect, my mother's trust and my life has been ruined.
[19:40] Hamza who loved me dearly left because of you.
[19:45] Where should I go? Who will marry me now?
[19:49] Tell me... why am I even talking to you?
[19:55] I will never forgive you.
[20:00] Fabiha... listen to me.
[20:19] What's the matter? Why are you guys looking at me like that?
[20:24] We cannot believe that someone could stoop so low...
Hamza!
[20:27] Don't shout!
[20:30] Because if I start screaming then you'll be made a mockery in front of the entire world.
[20:48] I know that you're torturing yourself being away from Arhum.
[20:54] If you stay away from him, it will only increase the distance between you two.
[20:59] You think that if you leave your place, it will remain empty all your life?
[21:06] A little distance is necessary after what I've been through.
[21:11] I need time to recuperate.
Time is merciless.
[21:17] And if you don't take the right decision at the right time then it can cause a lot of difficulty.
[21:23] When Arhum has acknowledged his mistake, you should forgive him.
[21:31] Men tend to make such mistakes.
What do you mean mother?
[21:39] You are defending Arhum for no reason. There is a right and wrong for men as well and Arhum should know his limits.
[21:48] Women have to be patient to maintain a home.
[21:54] We can't change what happened... forgive Arhum and move on in life.
[22:02] What about the pain?
[22:04] The pain I feel increasing when I look at Arhum?
[22:09] Pain remains throughout one's life.
[22:14] But you should think about your kids, they need the two of you.
[22:20] And the right think is that you will have to compromise.
[22:26] You cannot expect little kids to make sacrifices.
[22:31] Listen to your mother and forgive Arhum.
[22:37] And return home.
Let me know if you don't like me staying here.
[22:41] I can arrange for myself. But for now, I cannot go back to Arhum.
[22:48] Shenaya.
[23:26] Are you insane?
Yes I am.
[23:29] Can't you see my insanity?
You could have lost your life.
[23:32] Let it then... what is remaining in my life, I would rather die than live with this humiliation.
[23:39] Let me drop you home...
You've left me...
[23:44] There's no need for your false sympathies...
[23:49] My dying and living should make no difference to you. 
[23:51] Let's talk somewhere...
I don't want to talk to you.
[23:56] I will not leave you and you will come with me... so sit in the car.
[24:00] If you don't care about my respect, then think about yours... everyone is looking at us.
[24:05] Please.
[24:08] Please.
[25:38] Hamza.... is everything alright? Why are you here?
[25:43] Auntie, I came here to talk to Fabiha today and I don't want anyone to get in between.
[25:53] Fabiha is not at home.
[25:57] I'll wait for her.
[26:01] Wait for her...
[26:04] Wait for her then.
[26:47] Here you are.
[27:16] Yes...
[27:19] Hamza is here.
[27:24] He wants to talk to Fabiha.
[27:26] Where's Fabiha?
She's not home.
[27:31] Alright fine.
Where are you Fabiha?
[27:45] Hamza... drink some water.
[28:13] Drink some water...
[28:16] Please drink... and don't ever do something like this. It's my mistake...
[28:22] you don't need to punish yourself...
[28:28] I am the one who made a mistake giving you my heart.
[28:32] I never imagined this would happen.
[28:35] In fact, I didn't think about the future at all.
[28:40] Sometimes we are unable to do what we want, because fate has something else decided for us.
[28:47] It's not a given that what we want happens.
[28:52] How easily you have managed to escape this relationship.
[28:58] You expressed yourself and not once did you think...
[29:02] that how hopeful a woman gets when a man expresses his feeling towards her.
[29:07] I saw a thousand dream, even when I didn't want to...
[29:11] but for men, everything is easy.
[29:15] Men are free to do whatever they want, they don't have to bow in front of anything. It's the woman who is always labeled characterless.
[29:23] And you've proven that.
In my eyes your character is untainted.
[29:27] How will you prove that to the world?
[29:32] Even if you mention disloyalty to an illiterate man, the image that comes to his mind is that of a woman.
[29:37] But you can't understand that.
[29:42] Because men are never disloyal...
[29:46] You have ruined my life.
[29:51] And I don't want to waste my time by staying here.
[29:56] One more thing, if something were to happen to me... please ask my family's forgiveness...
[30:05] Maybe that will wash away a few stains on my character.
[30:22] If your apologies could have brought back my honor, then maybe I would have forgiven you...
[30:33] I'm not cursing you.
[30:41] Please drop me at my home.
[31:15] Anayah...
[31:24] Shenaya...
[31:28] Where am I lacking?
[31:35] There is nothing lacking in you.
[31:42] Am I not beautiful like I once was?
What are you saying?
[31:48] I'm right... I've stopping taking care of myself.
[31:53] Arhum... the house... the kids... inside all of those things, I've lost myself.
[32:00] Ever since I've married Arhum...
[32:05] I never thought that...
[32:08] he could get bored with me.
[32:13] If I knew that I would have taken care of myself.
[32:23] I'm not the Shenaya I once was. I can feel that I'm lacking in a lot of places.
[32:31] That's why Arhum..
[32:36] decided to pit me against that caretaker.
[32:41] You're like how you were.
[32:45] And... don't get insecure because of someone else.
[32:51] Don't hurt yourself because of an ordinary caretaker...
[32:55] No other woman can take place of a wife
[32:59] People who try to force their way can never be successful.
[33:05] Everything seems like a dream.
[33:07] It seems as though that when I wake up I'll hear Arhum call my name.
[33:13] He'll ask me about his coffee... he would ask whether the kids were ready for school or not...
[33:17] And I would tell him that I'm readying the kids for school...
[33:21] He would ask about his tie and his socks. He would ask whether I gave his mother insulin...
[33:25] He would ask about his breakfast and I would tell him that it was ready.
[33:32] After all these things... there was a sentence...
[33:37] He would tell me that if I weren't there...
[33:41] he would have nothing.
[33:45] He would say he would have nothing..
[33:48] Don't worry... have faith... everything will be alright.
[34:30] We're home.
[35:51] What's the matter? Why are you guys looking at me like that?
[35:56] We can't believe how someone could stoop so low.
Hamza!
[35:59] Don't shout! Because if I start screaming then you'll be made a mockery in front of the world.
[36:14] I realized what you were doing a long time, but love had me blinded.
[36:28] Arhum is well established, he earns more than me and he might be more handsome than me.
[36:40] He has a house... a car and a good bank balance. That's why you left me because of him.
[36:48] Right?
[36:51] It's nothing like that mother.
Really...
[36:54] It's nothing like that. We'll believe you... just look in my eyes...
[37:00] and tell me that you have nothing to do with Arhum... or better yet swear on your mother's life.
[37:05] What are you saying?
Swear on her life...
[37:08] and say that you have nothing to do with him.
Swear on her life!
[37:12] Yes I did have an affair with him!
[37:14] I do love him... I don't want to live with you, what will I gain living with you?
[37:19] What will I get? Poverty, starvation... tensions?
[37:23] I would gain nothing living with you.
Shame on you!
[37:28] Did I allow you to work so you could do this?
[37:32] I didn't do anything mother.
[37:36] I stayed in my limits and asked for my right.
Don't forget...
[37:40] Don't forget that your mother is still alive... I am the one who will make the decisions!
[37:45] I've already made my decision...
[37:52] Don't be so selfish....
I'm not...
[37:57] Whatever I'm doing is not only for myself... it's for you... this home...
[38:02] I won't be the only one who would have a good life... all our lives would improve.
[38:06] You can never have a life after burying your honor.
[38:11] The world will spit on you and your mother.
Come on mother!
[38:15] Don't talk about the world. The world doesn't care about people who are dead, let alone me.
[38:21] I had freed myself from this relationship a long time ago and it's time that Hamza does the same.
[38:29] Alright then you have no place in my home... get out!
Mother, what are you doing?
[38:36] Get out...
Mother what are you doing?
