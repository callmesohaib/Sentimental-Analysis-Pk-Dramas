[01:29] So what should I do? Should I listen to her quietly?
[01:33] Keep in mind that if any damage happened to my baby or Fabeeha
[01:38] Then I won't tolerate and will forget everything.
[01:41] It's not that difficult to burn in fire of love than in fire of hate.
[01:47] The fire is on.
[01:49] And this fire needs to be ignited more.
[01:51] I might get Arham
[01:57] When a woman loses her self respect then she has only got few breathes to live.
[02:04] I went to Fabeeha's favorite restaurant.
[02:10] I used to think that I will go with her someday.
[02:16] But it was in destiny to go there and see her with someone else.
[02:26] She was celebrating her birthday with Arham.
[02:38] Hamza, can I give you an advice.
[02:47] Take someone with you if you go there again.
[03:00] So that you may not feel yourself alone.
[03:13] Now don't ask me to find a girl for you.
[03:30] Your bandage is done.
[03:36] Thanks
[03:40] I don't have any other medicine for your pain.
[03:56] Do you know Farheen, maybe I came here because I feel relax after sharing my feelings with you.
[04:17] Well, I am happy that I helped you somehow.
[04:29] Do I bring tea for you?
No, I must leave now.
[04:38] Thanks again.
[07:36] Hareem, where is Hadi? Why he hasn't come yet?
Mom, he was not in room.
[07:55] Hadi where were you? Were you with aunt Fabeeha?
I was in backyard.
[08:11] When will your exams commence?
Tomorrow is my maths exam.
[08:21] And Hareem, what about you?
I have an exam of Urdu.
[08:27] Good, prepare well for that. Right?
[08:32] Fabeeha, take your medicine on time. Your prescription is put in side drawer. Take medicine with milk. Right?
[08:39] Arham, you don't have to worry. I will take good care of myself.
[08:45] You don't have to worry from anyone.
[08:52] Where are you going?
To bring milk, I have to take medicine.
[08:56] I will bring that.
[09:20] Finish your breakfast quickly.
[10:17] It's expired milk.
[10:44] Expired.
[10:51] All of these are expired.
[10:53] Arham
[11:17] It means that I put all expired packets.
[11:23] It will be fun now.
[11:26] Arham
[11:54] O Lord, you are very Forgiving and Merciful. You love us more than seventy mothers.
[12:04] For your love's sake, please bless my Sanaya's life with happiness.
[12:13] Turn the darkness of her life into light.
[12:22] O Lord, accept my prayers.
[12:27] Amen
[12:31] Mom, why didn't you come for breakfast despite Somiya came to you.
[12:39] I didn't want to eat at that time. I will eat when I will feel hungry. You don't have to worry about me.
[12:51] How long will you be angry with me?
[12:55] This is not anger.
[13:00] This is the pain which you have given me.
[13:24] I am sorry mom. Trust me, I didn't do anything for myself.
[13:34] I have done that because of you.
[13:43] You know that you are my whole world.
[13:47] I can't live without you.
[13:51] If Sanaya may have minded my words then I will apologize to her as well. But please don't be angry with me.
[14:02] Junaid listen, don't treat your sister like that again.
[14:09] I promise that I won't do that again.
[14:17] Please forgive me and forget my mistake.
[14:20] I am unable to understand that what will my daughter do?
[14:29] How will she spend her entire life?
[14:32] My mind is completely numb and I am unable to understand anything.
[14:37] Everything will be alright. Trust me, I will fix everything.
[14:44] I hope so.
[14:46] O Lord, accept my prayers.
[14:53] Come and have breakfast.
I am coming.
[14:58] Go, I am coming.
[15:17] Sister, all my desires are fulfilling very quickly and today Arham made me very happy.
[15:25] Today he has put stamp on his love for me.
Tell me, what happened?
[15:30] Well, he humiliated Sanaya and kicked her out of the house.
[15:37] He not only kicked her out of the house but he dropped her to her mother's house.
[15:42] Now let's see how long will she live there.
[15:46] Oh I see.
[15:48] Fabeeha, What magic did you do that you did that in few months what your mother-in-law could not do?
[15:56] Just think that fate is very kind to me. What I think is happening automatically.
[16:07] I put expired milk in fridge but I didn't know that milk is expired but when Arham saw that then he thought that Sanaya put that in fridge to harm our baby.
[16:19] Then Arham got emotional and did what he thought better.
[16:23] Without realizing that who is standing in front of him.
[16:29] Otherwise Sanaya is not that weak as much I considered her.
[16:33] It was not easy to compete against her.
I can't believe it that Arham can do that.
[16:39] There is a last solution that she should be kicked out of Arham's life just like she has kicked out from this house.
[16:49] And you will see that this will happen very soon.
[16:56] It's a matter of few days that Sanaya will have to leave Arham's life and then Arham will only be mine.
[17:44] Mom, I am leaving for office.
Has Hamza arrived?
[17:47] No, I will go by myself.
Listen, come a bit earlier today from office. A family is bringing proposal for you in the evening.
[17:55] Mom, you are doing this again. I have told you that I don't want to get married.
[18:00] I am not in a mood to listen to your decision.
[18:05] Just do as I said and that's it.
[18:09] Now go to office, you are getting late.
[18:11] I am unable to understand that why are you so concerned about my marriage.
[18:18] It would be better if you pray for my death instead of marrying me.
Oh really? Is your drama over?
[18:28] Now, go.
[18:31] Mom, why are you forcing me.
[18:37] I don't want to marry that man.
What do you mean?
[18:44] You are saying that you don't want to marry that man then tell me with whom with you want to get married.
[18:53] At the moment, I don't want to marry to anyone.
[18:58] OK
[19:00] Meet him once.
[19:04] If you like him then fine but if you don't then let's see.
[19:17] Go
[19:37] Take this.
[19:40] Sanaya
[19:42] Sanaya, what happened my dear?
Arham has kicked me out of the house.
[19:49] Everything is finished. Your daughter is ruined.
[19:55] Sanaya. Sanaya.
[19:59] Sanaya
[20:37] What happened mom?
She has locked herself in the room.
[20:40] Don't worry.
[20:42] Sanaya
[20:45] Sanaya.
Sanaya
[20:47] I am worried for you. Open the door.
[20:52] Sanaya open the door, we are getting worried.
[20:58] Sanaya.
Sanaya, I will talk to Arham. Think about your children.
[21:03] Open the door Sanaya.
Break the door.
[21:08] Break the lock.
[21:11] Sanaya, we are getting worried. Open the door.
[21:15] I will talk to Arham. Think about your children.
[21:19] Don't do anything wrong.
[21:24] Isn't there any extra key?
[21:26] Sanaya, can you hear us?
[21:30] Just go, I won't open door.
[22:25] So don't worry. You will get married where will you want.
[22:37] Where I want?
Yes.
[22:41] Arham
[22:43] Arham
[22:45] Where are you? I want to talk to you.
What's the matter? Why are you shouting?
[22:51] How dare you to leave my sister on the road?
Leave me.
[23:02] It's the limit Junaid. How long will Sanaya keep suffering like this because of brother Arham?
[23:10] He has kicked her out of the house today and one day he will divorce her. Then what will happen to children.
[23:17] I am unable to understand that how can he be that much senseless.
[23:25] What would that girl be thinking about her father?
[23:31] That her father left her and her mother on road like that.
It's our fault.
[23:40] We gave that lowly and shameless man respect being son-in-law of this house.
[23:45] And he humiliated our daughter in front of everyone.
We have given him that right.
[23:56] I don't know why women is asked to keep quiet.
[24:04] Woman should fight for her right because in-laws never give her any right or status of a daughter.
[24:15] I don't know why men are so proud?
[24:22] Her mother-in-law used to hate her when she was alive and now brother Arham is doing that.
How long will this go on?
[24:32] Both children and Sanaya are depressed but that won't happen anymore.
[24:38] Mom should talk to brother Arham.
Why would mom talk to him? I will talk to him.
[24:43] The matter will worsen more if you will talk to him, let mom deal him.
It's enough, now we will have to make a decision and I will do that now.
[24:50] No Junaid, listen to me.
[25:32] Why are you showing this much anger?
[25:41] Fabeeha, I am sorry. I couldn't even imagine that Sanaya will do anything like that.
[25:50] And she will go to that extent.
Arham, why are you apologizing. That's not your fault.
[25:59] And as far as Sanaya's jealousy is concerned then women do behave like that.
[26:04] They don't differentiate between right and wrong.
[26:07] And they can go to any extent just to achieve their goal.
[26:13] I trusted her so much.
[26:20] I always supported her and considered my mother wrong.
[26:29] I thought that she will secure her future and will become independent.
[26:34] So I should support her.
[26:42] Fabeeha, should I have to forcefully asked her to stay at home and told her that she can't go anywhere and she should stay at home and take care of house and children.
[26:54] But I didn't do that. And what did I get in reward?
[27:00] A woman can't get any success neither in her in-laws house nor in any other aspect of life without her husband.
[27:07] Just like a woman is behind every man's success in the same way there is always husband's support behind every woman's success.
[27:18] And you always supported her.
But she doesn't acknowledge that.
[27:25] When a woman starts to deny man's sacrifices then it's understood that she has set herself free from this relationship.
[27:46] Hadi will also come. Don't worry Sanaya.
Mom.
[27:51] What happened?
[27:52] Mom, Junaid has gone to Arham's house in anger.
Has Junaid lost his mind.
[27:57] Such matters can't resolve in anger. Junaid.
Mom, you know that he doesn't listen to anyone.
[28:37] Hi sir.
Sanaya, are you in office?
[28:40] Be ready with file for meeting.
[28:44] I am sorry sir, I couldn't come because of an emergency. I am coming within an hour.
[28:52] Don't worry sir, I am coming. Bye.
[30:06] Junaid. Stop. Junaid listen to me. Oh God.
Mom.
[30:15] Stop, listen to me.
[30:17] Mom, leave him. As you know that when he is angry, he doesn't listen to anyone.
[30:20] Oh God, I don't know what will he do there. 
[30:26] Mom, take care of yourself.
He never listens to me.
[30:30] Mom
[30:33] It's useless to talk to him.
[30:42] Arham.
Arham.
[30:46] Where are you? I want to talk to you.
What happened? Why are you shouting?
[30:52] How dare you to leave my sister on the road?
Leave me.
[31:05] You are protector of her dignity because she is your wife.
[31:11] Don't you care?
[31:14] I do care that's why I dropped her at home otherwise I would have left her on the road.
[31:20] I would have pushed her out of this house.
[31:22] You forgot all sacrifices of my sister because of this ordinary woman.
[31:25] Have you forgotten everything?
I do remember everything.
[31:35] You keep taunting me all the time because of your sister's job.
[31:45] Everyone taunts me that she manages expenses of my house.
I know because I am her brother.
[31:53] Ever since she has stopped contributing in household expenses you have kicked her out of your life. You are such a lowly person.
[32:01] Stop, don't say a single word.
[32:04] If I am giving you respect then it doesn't mean that you will say anything you want.
[32:12] Just leave.
[32:15] Now you will leave my sister's life.
[32:26] After today, no man will consider a woman helpless just like you have considered my sister.
[32:51] Has new stock been replenished?
[33:02] Farheen.
[33:08] What's the matter? You look worried.
[33:11] No, nothing.
[33:17] Tell me, what's the matter?
[33:23] It's useless to lie in front of me.
[33:28] You consider me as your friend. Right?
[33:31] Share with me, that may relax you.
[33:38] At the moment, mom is trying to lessen her burden.
[33:42] What do you mean?
She has found a proposal for me.
[33:49] She wants to lessen her burden by marrying me.
[33:54] That's a good thing Farheen.
[33:57] Yes, it's a very good thing. Do you know, with whom she wants to marry me?
[34:03] With whom?
He is father of a child.
[34:09] What are you saying?
Yes.
[34:12] I will go there as a governess not as a wife.
[34:17] Don't worry, I will talk to aunt.
She is not listening ot me then how will she listen to you.
[34:27] And by the way, why would you talk to him? That won't make any difference to you.
[34:32] Why are you saying so? Why doesn't that make any difference to me?
[34:38] It matters. I won't let that happen to you, I consider you as my friend.
[34:45] Hamza, I have told mom that if she will try to force me then I will poison myself.
Are you mad?
[34:55] I warn you if you did anything like that.
[35:00] Why?
[35:02] Will you feel sad if I will die?
[35:12] Say something. Why are you quiet?
[35:18] If I will sit like this then mom will consider me a burden.
[35:26] So it would be better for me to do something.
[35:30] As I said that you won't do anything like that. Understand.
[35:40] I will talk to aunt.
[35:43] I will stop her to marry you to that guy.
[35:53] Don't worry. You will marry to a man of your choice.
[36:05] To man of my choice?
Yes.
[36:17] Are you sure? Don't back off later.
[36:23] I know how to fulfill my promises.
[36:27] Promise?
Promise.
[36:36] I will talk to aunt. Don' worry.
[36:56] He is not receiving my call.
[36:59] Don't worry.
I forbade him.
[37:12] Bring water for Junaid.
Come here.
[37:18] I forbade you but you didn't listen to me and went there. What happened?
[37:25] I am asking, what happened there?
I have told him about my decision.
[37:34] Now Sanaya won't go to that house. It's enough.
[37:44] How can you make any decision on behalf of Sanaya?
Do you think that Sanaya can make any decision in this situation?
[37:53] Such decisions are not made out of emotions.
[38:00] Mom, the relations and decisions which are made out of emotions have same outcome which has happened to Sanaya.
[38:11] Arham has ruined this relation and I am making this decision in my complete consciousness.
[38:24] But Junaid, you should ask Sanaya once.
There is no need to ask from anyone.
[38:35] You just take care of Sanaya. I will take care of the rest.
[38:40] All requirements needs to be fulfilled for divorce.
[38:47] And you will have to fulfill that.
[39:34] How dare you to leave my sister on the road?
[39:42] I am her brother and I know that ever since she has stopped to contribute in household expenses, you have kicked her out of your life. You are such a lowly person.
[39:58] Now you will go out of my sister's life. After today, no man will consider a woman helpless just like you have considered my sister.
