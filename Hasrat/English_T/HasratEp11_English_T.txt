[01:08] I'm so sorry. Please sit. I'm so sorry you had to wait. What will you have? Tea? Coffee?
[01:13] No mam. Nothing.
[01:18] Fabiha, Hamza told me you've been working for long.
[01:22] Yes mam. She has been working in this field for five years now.
[01:27] Very good. So did anyone have any complaints with you in these five years?
[01:41] Or did you have any complaints about anyone?
[01:50] No. 
Absolutely fine.
[01:56] My mother in law is paralyzed.
[02:00] And you know how such patients are treated.
[02:06] She had an attack on the left side. You'll have to help her exercise and physiotherapy.
[02:13] From 9am to 7pm in the evening. I cannot afford holidays.
[02:19] You don't worry at all.
[02:24] Perfect. Alright then. Now you tell me what salary are you expecting?
[02:35] Whatever you think is fine. 
 Alright. You can join from tomorrow.
[02:58] Fabiha. 
 I'm really sorry. Are you hurt?
[03:11] Are you okay? I'm really sorry.
[03:15] Its okay.
[03:17] You people here? 
 Sanaya mam called us for the caretaker job.
[03:23] Oh alright. How was your meeting? 
 It went good.
[03:28] I'm Sanaya's husband. 
 Hie.
[03:33] I'm Fabiha's fiance. 
 Well thanks for coming.
[03:39] Lets go Fabiha. Bye sir. 
 Bye.
[03:52] Open your mouth. Good boy. 
 Mom?
[03:57] Hadi's teacher complained. He doesn't eat his lunch himself. He gives it to others.
[04:04] Its bad. Why don't you have your lunch? You should finish your lunch box. Okay?
[04:08] Mom makes it with so much love. You should eat it. Oh. Its you?
[04:14] You're home early today. 
 Yes. I had a meeting and en route I found out we had to wait for an hour.
[04:20] So I thought I'd come home. So did you find a caretaker?
[04:25] She'll come tomorrow. 
 Okay. You serve lunch. I'll get mom.
[04:34] Eat fast. Finish your food fast. Show mom, how can you eat yourself?
[04:46] I didn't get to spend time with you since so many days so I thought I'd have lunch with you today.
[04:52] I have no objections, you can give it to me on my room only. If only I get it on time. I'll pray for your wife then.
[05:04] Sanaya, get porridge for mom and heat the pulses too. 
 Sure.
[05:09] Do you want water? 
 No dear. I've been drinking that for long.
[06:15] Your plate. 
 Thank you.
[06:20] Mom, first we need to inject insulin.
[06:27] I've told Sanaya to give it to you in front of me. 
 Alright.
[06:32] When did this happen? 
 Mom, if she gives you insulin in front of me, I'll be satisfied and you'll be fine soon. If God wills.
[06:40] Alright. I should either get better fast or die.
[06:46] Kids feel their mothers are a burden if they get sick. Your wife already has a lot of responsibilities.
[06:54] Mom, why are you thinking this? You're my responsibility. Not Sanaya's.
[07:04] I'm your mother. I know what you say yourself and what others make you say.
[07:21] Alright. Don't be angry. Its not good for your health. Please eat.
[07:31] Mom? I'll wear my Elsa frock to grandma's house for dinner.
[07:38] Okay.
[07:41] You have a dinner with your in laws? You people have a plan for dinner?
[07:49] Yes. Its been a lot of days Sanaya hasn't visited her mother. I thought kids would meet their grandma too. They're missing her.
[07:57] Alright. It would have been good if she could have taken permission from her mother in law.
[08:05] My mother did call you.
[08:10] When?
[08:17] Nobody called me. When? 
 She called you.
[08:24] I might have missed it. She could have told me.
[08:31] I wouldn't have gone with you. I would have at least known.
[08:37] Alright, I'll call mom to call you. 
 No. Let it be. There's no need now.
[08:43] If you give importance to someone when its too late, its like slapping them.
[08:57] Oh well. I'll take it in my room. 
 Mom, finish your porridge at least.
[09:03] Let it be dear. I'm full. I'll take it along.
[09:16] You two finish your lunch.
[09:24] Mom.. why is grandma always upset with you?
[09:32] Finish your lunch, fast.
[09:47] Thank God, you have such a good job confirmed.
[09:51] And with such a handsome salary. 
 Thanks to you. It was possible because of you.
[09:57] You do so much for me. 
 When two hearts become one, nothing is separate.
[10:04] You'll always find me with you at every step.
[10:09] Alright, I'm getting late. Drop me at the hospital. God knows how much bill the hospital must have made.
[10:15] Don't worry. 
 Where will you pay from?
[10:20] Its my problem.
[10:22] But Hamza.. 
I told you. I have.
[10:25] You haven't gone home since last night. Did you talk to aunty?
[10:32] Lets go. Get up.
[10:42] Where did he go? He didn't even tell me. He hasn't come home all night.
[10:47] Mom, how do you know he didn't come home? Sometimes he leaves when we're sleeping in the morning.
[10:53] I woke up for the Fajr prayers. I saw the lights in Hamza's room switched on.
[10:57] I thought I'd go and switch them off but Hamza wasn't there.
[11:04] I'm worried about Hamza.
[11:07] Why isn't he answering? 
 Nothing will happen mom. Don't worry. Its ringing but he isn't answering.
[11:30] Your bag. 
 Alright. Now go home. Aunty must be worried.
[11:36] Alright. 
 Listen. Take care.
[11:40] You too.
[11:56] Hello? 
 Hello? Hamza? Where are you?
[12:00] I'm just leaving the hospital. 
 Hospital? Are you alright?
[12:04] Give it to me. Hamza dear?
[12:09] Where are you? You,
[12:12] are you alright? What are you doing in the hospital?
[12:15] Yes mom. Everything is alright. Don't worry. It was an emergency so I couldn't tell you.
[12:21] Fabiha's mother had a heart attack. I'll tell you everything when I get home.
[12:38] Shaheen is in the hospital. She had a heart attack. If he had told me, I'd have gone with him.
[12:47] We need family at this hour. The girls are all alone. 
 Mom..
[12:53] What if something happens to Shaheen aunty? What will become of Farheen and Fabiha?
[12:59] God forbid.
[13:02] But we all need to bow down when its a test from God.
[13:07] Whatever God has written in our fate. It will happen.
[13:12] May God pull these girls out of this test.
[13:18] Dear, do one thing. Call and ask about Fabiha after a while.
[13:24] To be honest, I'm worried more about my brother. If Fabiha is worried, he won't be at peace.
[13:33] You're right. He always get worried when she's worried. He's happy when she's happy.
[13:42] This is the identity of a good life partner.
[13:46] We shouldn't love someone so much that we breakdown if that person commits a mistake.
[13:52] What happened?
[13:56] Fabiha is a strong girl with a good character.
[14:01] I don't think bad about her at all and you shouldn't either.
[14:07] But I feel she's a bit hesitant. As if she needs distance.
[14:13] Don't think so deep. Some people are habitual of talking less.
[14:20] She's reserved. You should also talk less.
[14:28] She is so clever. I didn't know. Look at her face.
[14:33] She looks so innocent. Oh my God, forgive me. 
 Now do you understand?
[14:40] I wasn't wrong. Not only our sister in law, but her mother is very clever as well.
[14:45] Yes. Don't even talk about her mother. She's so secretive.
[14:51] Ever since I'm bedridden they have thrown me out like a fly from milk.
[14:57] Look at my son. They have dinner at their house today.
[15:02] He couldn't even ask me before he left. That mom..
[15:06] will you go along? Or not. Not at all. 
 Did she call you?
[15:12] Yes. I did. I didn't tell them.
[15:17] Its good. Now both the mother and sister will give clarifications to Arham now. 
 You did good.
[15:22] Will you be alone at home now? 
 What else?
[15:27] Its in our fate to be alone. 
 Its not your fate mom. Your daughter in law has made you all alone.
[15:34] And what is this? How can they leave their mother alone? I'm amazed at you.
[15:39] You should created a fuss and said no to Arham.
[15:44] Who listens to me in this house?
[15:48] Alongside the daughter, the mother too wants to control the husband.
[15:53] Yes both of them want the same thing. Otherwise my Arham, who would come running to me if I shouted once,
[16:00] he is following his in laws as if they didn't give away their daughter but we gave away our son.
[16:07] Mom, to tell you the truth, who is with you throughout the day? Who takes care of you?
[16:13] Sanaya and Arham take days off alternately. 
 So what could be better than that?
[16:19] The day Arham takes off, be so good that there's nobody better and the day Sanaya takes off,
[16:26] you show your real face. Just make sure you clear it to Arham that you don't bother anyone at all.
[16:32] And make Sanaya tell him you irritate her a lot. You'll see the chaos then.
[16:41] And how you'll have to do, you know well. 
 You're right.
[16:47] You're no less either.
[17:02] Hania, bring water for your brother.
[17:08] How did all this happen all of a sudden? How is Shaheen now?
[17:14] She's out of danger now. 
 Thank God.
[17:20] You must be tired, dear. You mustn't have eaten anything.
[17:27] Hania? Get food for your brother. 
 No. Let it be for me.
[17:34] Do one thing, get me something for Farheen and Fabiha. I'll eat with Fabiha.
[17:41] You were in the hospital since last night. Rest for a while before you go anywhere.
[17:46] Who asked you for advise? Go do your work. 
 Alright. Don't rest.
[17:52] I'm talking for your best. You're always shouting. 
 What happened? Why are you arguing with your younger sister always?
[17:58] Like you're worried for Fabiha, she's worried for you as well.
[18:04] I don't understand all this right now. I'm also worried mom.
[18:17] Fabiha?
[18:22] I couldn't understand anything. I did what I thought was fine.
[18:31] If something had happened to mom, I would have never forgiven you.
[18:41] I know I made a big mistake but this doesn't mean you blame me for everything.
[18:49] Circumstances often take a person's life.
[18:54] My luck was bad but you supported the bad luck and wronged your mother.
[19:04] Fabiha, what else do I have?
[19:10] Mom's love came in your share. A good life partner came in your share. What did I get?
[19:20] Wait.. hatred. helplessness.
[19:24] And if I did something for my peace, why did it cause such a big mess?
[19:33] When a person stops looking at right and wrong, the don't even see if there's a river in front of them.
[19:41] Just pray that our mother isn't punished for the mistakes you made.
[20:36] Yes I did call your mother in law and invite her for dinner. Did she tell you?
[20:42] No. I know. And you know Arham as well. I cannot say anything against his mom to him.
[20:49] And she clearly said Arham was lying. So I cannot argue now. If I argue, things will get worse.
[20:56] What must Arham be thinking about us? 
[20:59] You didn't put a condition that my mother in law would be like a mom to me, when you got me married.
[21:03] Dear, parents with daughters are always suffering from this fear. All their life.
[21:08] And, if only our daughters' happiness be given to them when they get married.
[21:18] Mom, I'm very happy. Don't worry. Tell me did you make arrangements for dinner?
[21:25] Yes, Soumya is doing everything. You know she cooks really well.
[21:30] Alright, we'll meet tonight at the dinner. Bye. 
 Okay mom. Bye.
[21:40] Did you talk to Sanaya? What did she say? When will she come? 
 I did talk.
[21:44] They'll come around 9- 10 pm. Actually, she has to give dinner to her mother in law.
[21:48] Its surprising how did her mother in law accept so easily? 
 Does she accept anything so easily?
[21:55] She told Arham that I didn't invite her. 
 What?!
[22:00] And Arham believed her?
[22:04] I don't understand. Does Arham not see how clever his mother is or does he ignore?
[22:10] Sometimes they have to ignore in such relationships. He doesn't want to answer back.
[22:22] I'm alright Fabiha. Nothing happened to me. 
 What if it did?
[22:27] Where will we go? What would we do? Have you ever thought? You just held your heart and laid down.
[22:34] Like my bad luck, my heartbeats are also very stubborn.
[22:40] They'll not stop so easily.
[22:47] Mom..
[22:55] Fabiha, tell her to leave from my sight.
[23:04] Ask her to leave. 
 Please..
[23:09] You should go for now.
[23:23] Don't think about it. 
 Dear.. I just had hopes pinned on my jewelry.
[23:32] To get rid of all the wretchedness.
[23:41] But Farheen snatched that as well.
[23:50] There's only one way to save our respect.
[23:54] What? 
 You should marry Hamza as soon as possible and make him the protector of your respect.
[24:03] See.. there is no room for saying no.
[24:09] Bad luck isn't in our hand but,
[24:15] we do have our respect and disrespect in our hands. 
 Mom..
[24:21] I have a job now. I'll pay him back very soon. Why are you worried? 
 But dear..
[24:29] You cannot earn hundred thousands in two days.
[24:34] One day has already passed.
[24:41] I'll go and ask doctors for the discharge.
[25:01] What should I do? I don't have money in my account and there's time in my salary.
[25:19] Hello? Hammad? Sorry I'm disturbing you right now but,
[25:25] there's an emergency. Fabiha's mother is hospitalized. She had a heart attack.
[25:33] I need some money. 25000.
[25:38] I'll return as soon as my salary comes. Please have it arranged for me. Anyway possible. I'll return them to you.
[25:52] Alright. Fine. Fine. I'll ask Haider. Okay.
[26:37] Yes mom? You called. 
 I feel suffocated sitting inside.
[26:44] Take me to the lawn. 
 Alright, I'll take you.
[27:36] Give me my scarf.
[28:04] Hania, what is this? 
 They aren't much but they'll be useful to you.
[28:12] How did you get so much money? 
 Its my pocket money. I saved them for you.
[28:20] Brothers can forget their sisters in bad times but sisters will never forget their brothers.
[28:30] Come here. Sit with me. Sit down.
[28:40] I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you this way.
[28:47] You were never like this, brother. I don't know what has happened to you.
[28:53] I am like this. 
 No. You were never like this.
[28:58] You're lost when you loved someone and started worrying for them.
[29:05] Its not that Hania. 
 It is so.
[29:10] Otherwise, someone who could hide his worries behind a smile and didn't make his mom and sister realize,
[29:20] today he cannot hide a single pain. Why? What happened?
[29:26] You're in love. People learn to live when in love.
[29:32] You've finished yourself.
[29:37] What can I do Hania? I cannot do anything for Fabiha, even when I want to.
[29:44] What do you want to do?
[29:50] I want her to be free of all her responsibilities so that she can only love me.
[29:57] She can give me time and only think about me. So that she's only mine.
[30:13] They are yours. Keep them.
[30:29] Make me a milkshake. 
 Sure.
[30:33] And listen, make it cold. Don't make it hot like your temperament.
[30:46] Sure.
[31:41] Yes mom? 
 My mobile fell down. Please pick it up.
[31:51] Thank you dear. 
 Mom, anything else?
[31:54] Nothing.
[33:20] Yes mom? 
 This milkshake spilled on my clothes.
[33:27] I didn't have tissue or else I'd have cleaned it up. Get me a tissue.
[33:38] I'll get it.
[34:29] Yes? 
 Just take me inside now.
[34:58] I don't have the bad fate in my hand, but..
[35:02] we do have our respect and disrespect in our hands.
[35:53] Alright now. 
 Where are you going?
[35:57] Actually, I have to get the kids' clothes for tonight. I'm going to do that.
[36:04] Yes. You can do that. Make me exercise. The doctor said at least two times in the day.
[36:15] Physiotherapy. I cannot do it alone.
[36:43] Hello? Haris? Hello? Haris?
[36:49] Haris, can you hear me? Hello.
[36:55] The net had to die right now. I'll call uncle.
[37:08] Hello? Hello uncle. This is Farheen.
[37:14] What should I tell you? We have one problem after another, uncle.
[37:21] Yes. Mom had a heart attack.
[37:26] Yes. Yes. She's better now. She's at home. Uncle,
[37:33] did you meet Haris?
[37:38] What? You don't know Haris came there? But he told me he had informed you.
[37:51] Yes. Yes. I talked to him last night. He said he'd meet you definitely.
[37:59] Alright. Uncle, let me know when you meet him.
[38:06] Alright. Fine. Okay. Bye.
