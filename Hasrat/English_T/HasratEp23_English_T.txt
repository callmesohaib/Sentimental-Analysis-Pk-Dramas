[00:13] Auntie said something very weird to me today.
[00:19] What's that? 
[00:22] She told me that I should include myself in Arhum's life.
[00:25] and you've been free from my responsibility a long time ago. Go and have fun.
[00:32] Mother, she's going because of an important meeting.
[00:34]  What did I say? 
[00:36] Everyone has their priorities. To some people family is the most important thing...
[00:41] for other it's their future. 
[00:44] It's all about making the right decision at the right time.
[00:55] these are my most favorite earrings
[01:00] Arham's father bought this for me with so much love, and I have used them many times
[01:04] I won't wear them anymore
[01:07] I want to give them to you
[01:09] No no aunty, I cannot take it
[01:11] if maam Sanaya will get to know then she will get angry for no reason
[01:14] keep it, I am giving it with my own happiness
[01:17] so why anyone else will interfere in this matter?
[01:20] therefore, you don't need to be afraid at all
[01:25] they are quite ordinary
[01:26] but my dreams, my wishes... 
[01:29] my desires are way too bigger than this
[01:32] and only Arham will complete them
[01:36] what's the matter, didn't you like them?
[01:40] No no, they are really pretty. Thank you!
[01:42] then wear them, & show me
[01:53] see... 
[01:56] Come in, dear. You haven't been here in so many days
[02:00] is everything fine at your home?
[02:03] yes
[02:04] sit down
[02:07] is your mother fine?
[02:09] yes
[02:12] what's the matter, Hamza?
[02:14] did you & Fabiha had any argument?
[02:21] this is what I want to know aunty, that what as such is the matter
[02:27] oh no, maybe you are having a misunderstanding
[02:29] See, you know she is such a sensitive girl
[02:36] Ever since she found out about your embezzlement matter, she's been very confused
[02:41] but.. 
[02:43] I've explained her so much
[02:45] that see, I can never believe that Hamza can do any such thing
[02:51] No aunty, she is not concerned about it. If she had been worried about it, then she would have talked to me
[02:56] She would have fought with me to express her anger
[02:59] but she is trying to tell me something else by staying quiet & ignoring me
[03:07] No no, I don't think so that there is any such matter
[03:09] actually, she is over burden with work
[03:12] maybe that's why
[03:14] why are you worrying?
[03:17] I am here
[03:18] I will explain her, don't worry
[03:23] Okay
[03:24] you may explain her
[03:26] you may talk to her
[03:31] but in front of me
[03:33] I also want to hear
[03:46] in front of you?
[03:50] yes
[03:52] I know, she hasn't come back home as of yet
[03:55] therefore, today I will sit here & wait for her
[04:14] Hadi, don't do like this
[04:17] children are brave, now look at Hareem. She is not crying
[04:20] I want to go to my mom
[04:22] hmm.... 
[04:24] if you will go to your mom, then who will go to the school tomorrow?
[04:31] how to fix Hadi's mood?
[04:34] hmm... shall we play some game?
[04:36] yes!
[04:38] lets play the racing game
[04:40] No
[04:40] Hadi, please play with us. We will enjoy a lot
No, no!
[04:43] okay, cricket?
[04:45] hide & seek?
[04:50] you haven't gone as of yet?
[04:52] actually how could I leave the kids alone, also Hadi's mood was also off so
[04:58] what happened to my Spiderman? Are you missing your mom?
[05:01] don't worry! Lets go to the play area, we'll have food there & an ice cream too. Say what?
[05:06] yaay.... 
[05:08] then we'll go to drop Fabiha aunty to her house on our way back
[05:11] we will enjoy a lot
[05:13] it will get very late, I need to go home
[05:16] the kids are insisting, its just a matter of today. Please
[05:22] your aunty has agreed, lets go. Come
[05:31] Hareem, if you don't like it then return it or change it
[05:35] ok?
[05:39] Fabiha, thank you so much
[05:41] to take care of my kids with all your happiness
[05:44] The kids have made me their own in such a short time
[05:47] do you know, if any one of them gets upset then I feel so restless
[05:50] therefore, I cannot refuse the kids
[05:54] actually the kids have never been away from Sanaya, its their first time
[05:58] and you?
[06:00] I mean, haven't you went somewhere far?
[06:05] No, no, the kids never let me go far from them
[06:10] anyways, would you like to eat something else?
[06:11] no no, thank you!
[06:48] hurry up
[06:51] will you wear this jewelry?
[06:53] No, tomorrow is my teacher's birthday
[06:56] oh... 
[06:58] will you help me in buying the gift for her?
[07:01] absolutely! Umm... 
[07:04] how are these?
[07:06] No
[07:07] No?
they are not good
[07:09] Okay.. then how is this?
[07:13] oh nice! Its very beautiful, nice
[07:19] I think you should buy it
[07:22] me?
[07:24] what happened?
[07:26] don't you like it?
[07:27] No, its very beautiful
[07:29] then?
[07:31] excuse me
[07:33] hello!
[07:36] how was your meeting?
[07:38] The first meeting is done, it went well. Now tomorrow is our presentation
[07:43] you tell me, where are you? Its quite noise, it seems as if you are somewhere outside
[07:47] yes, I came out with friends
[07:53] where are the kids?
[07:55] the kids are at home, sleeping
[07:58] Can I call you back after going home? They are calling me
[08:01] Arham listen, the internet is not working here so don't send me a watsapp
[08:06] Okay, bye!
dad
[08:10] Hareem?
[08:12] Hareem?
[08:13] hello!
[08:19] it cannot be Hareem, as the kids are sleeping at home
[08:23] Relax Sanaya, don't take so much of stress
[08:26] its just the matter of 2 days
[08:38] oh!
[08:41] Arham, drive carefully. See he got injured
[08:45] is it hurting a lot, Hadi?
[08:46] I am fine
[08:48] drive carefully, even Hareem is sleeping on the back seat
[08:54] By the way, the kids were very happy today because of you
[08:57] thank you!
[08:59] honestly speaking, I love to spend time with the kids
[09:03] and they are unable to go anywhere, that's why
[09:07] well, thank you so much for coming
[09:10] its nothing like that
[09:13] I have become used to of the kids, you don't need to thank me
[09:19] let me call Sanaya
[10:07] hey Fabiha
[10:09] thank God you are back, we have been waiting for you since so long
[10:12] where were you, you weren't receiving my call as well
[10:19] where were you since so long?
[10:21] I am asking you, where were you since so long?
[10:24] mom, I was with the kids as they were alone
[10:27] Okay
[10:29] with whom you came back?
[10:34] tell me!
[10:36] with whom you came back?
with Sir Arham
[10:47] I will look on this matter later
[10:50] first of all tell me what is your issue with Hamza?
[10:53] neither you receive his call, nor talk to him. What is your problem?
[10:57] I don't want to talk on this matter right now, so please don't force me
[11:02] we'll talk later
[11:06] why later? why not now?
[11:08] I need to answer Hamza
[11:10] as I said, I don't want to talk about it!
[11:14] Fabiha
[11:19] aunty, don't be angry. Please sit down
[11:31] if you allow me, then can I talk to Fabiha?
[11:43] go
[12:01] a moment is required to understand a person
[12:07] you know me & I know you since so many years
[12:13] but you couldn't understand me, Fabiha
[12:19] I am stubborn
[12:23] I am emotional
[12:25] I can be a liar
[12:28] I can be ill-mannered
[12:32] but I am not a thief or unfaithful, Fabiha
[12:40] don't you trust me this much?
[12:44] what was the need to say anything to mom, Hamza?
[12:47] what else I could do, Fabiha. I was unable to understand
[12:51] neither you are talking to me, nor your are receiving my call
[12:54] if I am not attending your call it doesn't mean that you shall come to my house
[12:58] I do remember all your favors
[13:01] but those favors doesn't mean that you shall forget your limit
[13:05] I am not your wife, Hamza
[13:08] neither you have any right on me
[13:10] therefore, its better for you to remember your value before imposing your right on me
[13:16] and what is my value?
[13:19] I want to know
[13:24] you can talk to me clearly today, there is no need to be afraid
[13:27] Hamza, I don't want to discuss anything with you right now. So go away
[13:31] We'll talk whenever I'm in the mood to talk
[13:34] what if your never get into the mood then?
[13:37] as I said, leave from here
[13:43] Fabiha, I need an answer
[13:46] Hamza, go away from here. Go!
[13:56] Okay
[13:59] I am leaving now as you are angry
[14:04] we'll talk later
[14:24] granny
[14:27] granny
[14:28] we are unable to sleep, can we sleep with you?
[14:32] what is the problem?
[14:34] every night you guys sleep easily, so why not today?
[14:38] we are feeling afraid
[14:41] oh my God! then go & sleep with your dad
[14:45] we had gone there
[14:47] but dad is not there
[14:51] come here, lye down
[14:57] don't make noise, no talking. Ok?
[15:00] come on, you could have come from that side. dear
[15:04] oh my God.. 
[15:09] come on
[15:10] here, take one more pillow
[15:17] their mother have gone
[15:19] now they are ruining our sleep
[15:22] granny, do you know any story?
[15:26] I don't know any story, quietly go to sleep
[15:29] granny, please tell us some
[15:31] oho Hareem, close your eyes. Hurry up!
[15:34] come on, I am switching off the light
[15:37] close your eyes, take God's name. You will fall asleep
[15:40] come on, good kids
[15:58] honestly speaking, I love to spend time with the kids
[16:03] and they are unable to go anywhere, that's why
[16:29] hi Sanaya!
[16:32] hello! you were calling?
[16:34] No no.. you must be missing me. Right?
[16:37] I'm sorry Arham, I couldn't receive your call as I was preparing the presentation
[16:44] its ok
[16:47] haven't you slept as of yet?
[16:50] even you haven't slept
[16:52] I am missing you
[16:54] I don't feel like staying here
[16:56] everything is so good here
[16:59] but there is something missing
[17:02] maybe you
[17:04] If you had been here, then all of this would have looked even better
[17:15] what's the matter, why are you so quiet?
[17:19] I am listening to you
[17:21] Arham, distances are just namely
[17:24] actually these distances makes a person more closer
[17:30] ok tell me, how is the weather there
[17:33] The rainfall can happen anytime here
[17:36] There's a prediction of rainfall here as well
[17:39] it will happen anytime
[17:42] hmm... its good
[17:44] you will miss me a lot while enjoying in the rain
[17:49] so my value will increase a lot before coming back
[17:54] hmm... 
[17:58] anyways... 
[18:00] I am tired
[18:01] I am going to rest, you also go to sleep as you have a meeting tomorrow morning
[18:05] okay, go to sleep
[18:08] I love you!
[18:11] good night!
[18:12] love you too!
[19:04] what is this happening?
[19:08] what do you mean?
[19:10] I mean, what is happening in your life will you tell us?
[19:14] I didn't get it
[19:17] don't pretend, you understand all!
[19:19] tell me the truth
[19:21] did you had any discussion with Hamza or not?
[19:24] Tell me the truth, or I'll make you guys sit in front of each other
[19:28] mom, don't know why are you so concerned about Hamza
[19:31] he doesn't care about respect
[19:34] He has beaten Mr. Safdar's son
[19:37] Thank God I apologized to him, or else there would have been a big commotion at our house
[19:40] Hamza hadn't left any chance though
[19:42] Okay, so did Mr. Safdar tell the reason for it?
[19:46] because he was looking at your daughter
[19:49] maybe Hamza doesn't know that I am a girl & millions of men will look at me
[19:52] Will he make the entire world blind for me?
[19:55] he is your to-be husband
[19:57] if he won't mind then who else will mind?
[20:00] mom, he is my to-be husband
[20:03] he hasn't become one yet
[20:05] and Hamza is also the same men from this world
[20:09] he is my fiance not husband
[20:11] but your support has made him my husband
[20:14] What rubbish you are uttering, are you in your senses?
[20:18] mom, let me handle Hamza in my own way
[20:21] don't give him so much of freedom by giving him so much of support
[20:25] do give him as much respect as you want to, but please don't give your daughter's right to him before time
[20:42] It seems as if she has breathed life into the people of this house
[20:48] See how she has handled the house; it doesn't seem like Sanaya is not here
[20:53] Arham, the actual thing is that
[20:56] Only that person is important whose absence shatters everything
[21:01] Nothing has changed due to Sanaya's absence
[21:04] everyone is happy
[21:06] the kids, you & me as well
[21:58] Good children have their breakfast on time, okay?
[22:02] hey, Hareem start eating
[22:05] Okay
[22:06] hurry up
[22:08] Before everyone comes and says they haven't had breakfast
[22:12] how come!
[22:13] hey...
its my responsibility
[22:15] Let me do it, as my therapist told me that I have to do the hard work myself. Leave it, Arham
[22:21] Look here, we need to impress the kids too
is it fine, dear?
[22:24] come on
[22:25] is it looking good that your granny is coming on her own
[22:33] come on, eat
[22:35] hurry up
[23:11] thank you!
[23:14] this girl has magic in her hands
[23:19] come on Hadi, quickly finish it
[23:21] we have to eat quickly
[23:26] Here you go, just look at this... such heavy rain. How will you go to your office in such a downpour?
[23:31] yaay its raining
[23:34] we won't go to school today
[23:36] hey, look at him
[23:39] aunty, come. Lets go & enjoy in the rain
[23:41] come on...
but I will get wet
[23:44] it ok, come on
[23:45] go, enjoy in the rain. Its okay
[23:48] let them go, take them dear
[23:52] take me as well, I also want to see the rain. Come on
[23:56] in the name of Allah. Its raining after so long
[23:59] its a sudden rain
oh yes!
[24:14] I can see you're so happy after so many days
[24:18] I feel so good
[24:19] its all because of Fabiha
[24:24] It seems as if she has breathed life into the people of this house
[24:31] See how she has handled the house; it doesn't seem like Sanaya is not here
[24:35] Arham, the actual thing is that
[24:39] Only that person is important whose absence shatters everything
[24:44] Nothing has changed due to Sanaya's absence
[24:47] everyone is happy
the kids, you & me as well
[24:55] do you know what
[24:57] last night, the kids were feeling scared while sleeping
[25:00] then I made them sleep with me
[25:02] kindly ask Fabiha to stay here tonight
[25:04] so that she can sleep with the kids
[25:06] mom, how will Fabiha stay? Her mother won't allow
[25:09] I will seek permission from her mother, you just talk to Fabiha
[25:15] look at them. Go, you also enjoy in the rain
[25:19] but I have to go to the office
[25:21] hey! these are the only days to enjoy with the kids. Get up!
[27:54] yes Samreen, can you hear me? Is everything fine in the office?
[27:58] Sanaya, where are you? I've been trying to call you since yesterday, but your number is continuously switched off
[28:03] I want to discuss something important with you
[28:05] I understand, but the place where I'm staying has a lot of network issues
[28:10] it means, you haven't seen the picture as of yet
[28:13] which picture?
[28:15] yesterday I saw Arham...
Arham what?
[28:18] I saw Arham with a girl
[28:20] what!
[28:21] are you out of your mind?
[28:24] Arham... he can never do this and...
[28:28] you might have some misunderstanding
[28:30] Even your misunderstanding will be cleared once you see the picture. I am not having any misunderstanding
[28:36] Arham, that too with some girl
[28:38] I had a word with him last night, and he was out with his friends
[28:41] and he cannot lie to me, out of question
[28:44] leave this topic. We'll discuss it once I am back. Ok, bye!
[29:14] Greetings!
[29:16] Such heavy rainfall, it seems as if there is a thunderstorm
[29:19] the weather is so bad, its raining heavily but Fabiha doesn't care about anything
[29:25] even you came back on time, but I don't know where is she
[29:28] oh mom, don't be after Fabiha. She has already decided everything about herself
[29:33] you are saying as if she has told you everything
[29:36] will you believe my words, even if she had told me everything?
[29:38] therefore, end this argument
[29:40] even I don't want to argue about anything.
[29:43]  Call & ask her, where is she & at what time she will come home
[29:46] Okay
[29:53] whose call is it?
[29:54] don't know, its coming from an unknown number
[29:57] hello!
[29:58] yes, is this Shaheen speaking?
[30:01] I am Arham's mother speaking. Greetings! How are you?
[30:05] yes, I am fine. Is everything fine as you have called me at this time
[30:11] yes yes, everything is fine. Actually the children parents have gone out of city for a day
[30:17] So, as you know that I cannot handle the kids all by myself
[30:21] So I was thinking, if you're okay with it, Fabiha could stay here tonight
[30:27] No sister, I'm sorry. See, it doesn't look good that a girl shall stay in someone else's house
[30:35] we are not strangers, Fabiha is just like my own daughter
[30:40] and then who else is at home? Only I am here & the kids
[30:44] how shall I handle the kids? Its a bit difficult, I hope you do understand
[30:49] So, if nothing else, at least allow her to stay here tonight on humanitarian grounds
[30:57] as far as over time amount is concerned then Arham will send it to you once he comes back
[31:04] Okay, fine
[31:06] ok, thank you so much
[31:08] bye!
[31:15] what happened mom? Who was it?
[31:19] it was Arham's mother, she was saying that Fabiha will stay there tonight
[31:25] let me bring tea for you, as you came all wet in the rain
[31:56] I do remember all your favors
[31:59] But those favors doesn't mean that you shall forget your limit
[32:03] I am not your wife, Hamza
[32:06] neither you have any right on me
[32:08] therefore, its better for you to remember your value before imposing your right on me
[32:52] both of you shall not come out of the room, ok?
[32:55] I will bring hot milk for both of you
[32:57] Okay
[33:06] Ok, I am coming in a while
[33:07] ok
[33:11] I've ruined your hair, now I will tell Fabiha aunty that you've messed them up
[33:40] oh!
[34:09] Fabiha
[34:11] you haven't change your dress as of yet
[34:13] you'll catch cold, as your clothes are wet
[34:16] No, its fine. They'll dry within some time
[34:18] Please, if you will get sick then it will be a very big problem for me
[34:23] what do you mean, I didn't get it
[34:26] If you get sick, then I will have to do all the work. Furthermore, the kids are alone
[34:31] I cannot stand it that you shall work in my presence
[34:33] don't worry about that
[34:36] Okay
[34:38] by the way, tell me something
[34:41] why are you formal with me?
[34:44] why do you talk to me so formally?
[34:47] even you call me Arham sir, so that's why
[34:50] Okay, so what were you saying?
[34:52] Okay, actually...
[34:54] Fabiha, I was saying if you could...
[34:56] again formal?
[34:57] okay 'you' informal
[35:00] "Fabiha, if you could stay with the kids tonight, they will feel better since they are alone
[35:08] but how can I stay?
[35:11] I am not allowed to by my mother
[35:13] Don't worry about that. My mother talked to your mother, and she said it's fine
[35:18] really?
[35:23] okay
[35:26] thank you!
[36:32] maybe she is busy in a meeting
[36:35] lets go
[36:37] Oh, it would have been really nice if you had visited while your daughter was here
[36:41] Obviously, a daughter's in-laws' house is only because of her
[36:45] she is sitting there in Islamabad
[36:47] and you are here
[36:49] Sanaya told me that she is going to Islamabad, but today I am here to meet Arham specifically
[36:55] the promotion matter has become an old one
[36:58] I did many calls, but we couldn't talk
[37:01] that's why I am so embarrassed
[37:03] its ok aunty, its enough for me that you are happy for me
[37:07] I came to invite you for dinner because of this good news
[37:10] Since Sanaya will come tomorrow, why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night?
[37:16] do take permission from sister Riffat as well
[37:20] only Sanaya's orders are obeyed in this house, if you remember
[37:24] if they don't have any problem, then obviously they have my permission too
[37:31] Besides, there are no more in-laws houses where daughter-in-laws used to obey all the orders
[37:37] now its their own will, they own happiness
[37:41] Greetings!*
[37:51] bring it in
[37:57] who is she? Her introduction
[38:00] she?
[38:02] She is Fabiha, our dearest Fabiha
[38:06] my caretaker
