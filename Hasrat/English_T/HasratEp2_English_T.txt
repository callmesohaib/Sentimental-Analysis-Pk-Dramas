[00:13] Mom, you don't have to apologize. 
[00:15] why sorry? Its not the matter of sorry
Arham, trust me, I went to her room. 
[00:19] Sanaya, not necessarily mom would have forgotten.
You can also forget because you get so busy.
[00:24]  But how, I remembered that.
[00:25]  It's enough. There is no need to argue.
[00:28] Go and bring her insulin, I will inject that. Then give her tea. We are getting late for office as well.
[00:33]  Nothing has happened? She will be alright. Doctors are treating her.
[00:35] Yes but I dropped Hareem at your home so what are we doing here in hospital? 
[00:39] Brother Arham actually Hareem had a very high favor and then her body started to shake suddenly and then.. 
[00:46] Then what sister?
[00:47] She fainted.
[01:02] Hello!
[01:03] hello! Greetings sir, I am Hadi's class teacher. Hadi is sitting all alone in school. Why haven't you come to take him as yet?
[01:15] Is Hadi still in school?
[01:20] Sir, sorry to say but there is a limit of showing carelessness
[01:24] come quickly to pick him, bye!
[01:27] nobody picked Hadi from school. Did you get a call?
[01:30] actually Sanaya wasn't picking the call, so the driver had called me but... 
[01:35] I completely forgot as I was so tensed about Hareem
[01:38] Arham, lets do one thing. Let me go & pick Hadi from the school. You stay here
[01:42] No its okay, I am going
[01:43] try to understand my point, you should be at the hospital right now. Please
[01:46] let me also come with you
[01:48] lets go
[01:48] aunty, you shall also go. I am here
[01:51] you must be tired
[01:52] come mom, lets go
[02:09] we'll go very slowly, you don't have to make any noise
[02:20] where are you taking her?
[02:22] I am taking her outside to the garden
[02:24] if maam saw you then she will create so much of chaos
[02:27] why? She also has the right to go out in the fresh air
[02:29] maam doesn't like her to step outside her room
[02:33] she breaks the things in anger
[02:36] she won't break today, I am here. I will handle her
[02:39] I am telling you to make you understand. Rest is your choice
[02:42] nothing will happen
[02:45] lets go
[02:47] in the name of God...
my child
[02:51] she is back home safely, oh my God..
[02:55] Hareem, how are you?
[02:58] look here, my child... look at your granny
[03:00] oh my God, my child has become so weak in a single day
[03:05] my child, you don't know how worried your granny was
[03:11] I can't tell you, what I was going through
[03:15] thank God... where is Hadi?
[03:19] he is at his granny's house
[03:21] what had happened to her?
[03:23] nothing mom, her fever spiked due to which they took her to the hospital
[03:27] what do you mean that she had high fever? Didn't anyone gave her the medicine?
[03:31] why they didn't tried to take off her fever?
[03:34] Sanaya
[03:36] didn't anyone gave her the medicine?
[03:39] sit here my child
[03:41] Its obvious, they wouldn't have given her the medicine. 
[03:43] When a mother doesn't care about her child, then how come anyone else will?
[03:55] drink this, come on
[04:00] its not like that, mom. I had a very important meeting, that's why I had to go
[04:04] otherwise, I would have never gone after leaving Hareem
[04:08] was your meeting more important that your child's life?
[04:13] what's wrong with you, Sanaya?
[04:16] you give thousands of your hours to your office in a month
[04:21] if you would have given 24 hours to your sick daughter, then she wouldn't have come from the hospital after battling with life & death
[04:29] I didn't had an idea mom, that Hareem will fall so sick
[04:34] yes, why will you have an idea
[04:37] that's why I say, try to become a mother of your children instead of governess
[04:42] if you will become one, the only you'll have all the knowledge
[04:45] you will have all the ideas
[04:48] tell me... 
[04:51] if something would have happened to my grand daughter, then who would have taken the responsibility?
[04:55] will your family take the responsibility?
[05:00] there is no fault of my family in this, mom
and God forbid that any such thing shall happen to my daughter
[05:06] hey... 
[05:08] but there is someone's fault, missy
[05:11] this sick child won't take the medicine herself, somebody had to give her the medicine
[05:15] and they didn't give her
[05:18] do they have any idea that how we would have felt if something would have happened to her?
[05:23] who can feel the pain more than a mother, mom?
[05:26] yes
[05:28] obviously.. 
[05:30] and if you are hurt
[05:32] then leave the job, sit at home & handle your kids
[05:38] how much more you'll covet?
[05:41] when this greed will end?
[05:44] we have a house, we have cars. We have everything, then what else do you want Sanaya?
[05:50] I don't want anything, mom
[05:52] this house needs my job, my kids future needs it. Also Arham needs it
[05:58] and if he'll say it himself
[06:01] if Arham says it himself to you to leave the job
[06:05] will you leave it then?
[06:10] remember my words, Sanaya
[06:14] a mother can fulfill a miss of every relation but... 
[06:19] nobody can fulfill the amiss of a mother
[06:34] do you like flowers?
[06:37] I also had a flower like son
[06:41] what do you mean by "had"?
[06:42] my daughter-in-law had snatched him
[06:45] She locks my room when you leave
[06:50] but why?
[06:52] this woman hates me. She hates me!
[06:55] I will kill her, I won't spare her
[06:58] She had snatched my son from me, I will kill her
[07:02] I will kill her!
[07:04] he is my son! She had snatched my son from me
[07:07] what is happening here?
[07:09] with whose permission you have brought her out of her room, tell me!
[07:13] actually...
what actually?
[07:15] she was insisting... 
[07:16] if tomorrow she'll insist to oust her from this house, so will you oust her?
[07:20] for what you take the salary? Can't you handle one woman?
[07:23] I'm sorry maam
[07:24] Listen! I will do something wrong in anger. Pick up your things & get lost
[07:29] maam, I really need this job... 
[07:31] I don't need you at all, just get out of here
[07:36] pick up your things & leave!
[07:37] but listen to me, please.. I am really sorry
[07:40] sorry for what? 
Guard, oust her from here. I shall not see her again
[07:45] pick up her things & oust her!
I'm sorry
[07:47] Maam, please listen to me. Just give me one chance..
sister
[07:50] See, I beg you
[09:19] yes Fabiha, where are you? I have been waiting for you since so long
[09:22] I am at the bus stop
[09:23] bus stop?
Ok, I am coming
[10:10] what happened? Isn't Arham reeving the phone?
[10:13] I've been trying since evening, but no response
[10:15] even Sanaya isn't receiving the call
[10:18] I think, brother Arham got upset with her
[10:23] by the way, I am also feeling the same
[10:25] but we don't have any fault in it
[10:28] in fact, we were handling his responsibility. He should be thankful to us
[10:33] Strange! this incident could have happened in Sanaya's mother-in-law presence too
[10:39] Look, we cannot say such things to them
[10:43] when a daughter is wed off, then we need to give more importance to her in-laws than her
[10:49] so that she can stay happy there
[10:52]  this is the tradition, also we've seen the same 
[10:55] mom, Sanaya won't get the reward of our silence at her in-laws house. No matter what we do
[11:01] you don't know, Sanaya's mother-in-law must have scolded her too much over there
[11:04] I am not worried about all this
[11:07] I am just worried about Hareem
[11:09] mom, don't worry otherwise you'll fall sick
[11:14] please take something
[11:16] Hadi & Anaya had slept?
[11:18] yes mom, they are asleep
[11:22] Junaid, try calling Arham once again
[11:26] okay
[11:32] *sorry, the number you have dialed is powered off*
[11:37] the phone is off
[11:38] I think we should go there
[11:43] I think, we shall go in the morning
[11:46] mom, leave it & have dinner. Otherwise, you'll fall sick
[11:49] I want that one...
[11:51] do you want to eat this, mom?
give that to me
[11:52] here
[11:57] wow, its so soft
[11:58] Hareem...
so soft
[12:01] See, what I have brought for my dear child
[12:06] your favorite corn soup
[12:10] we'll drink it, finish it & get well soon
[12:16] come on, try a bit & tell me how mom had made it
[12:20] open your mouth... 
[12:24] yummy!
[12:24] really? that's great!
[12:26] we'll finish it quickly, you'll get well & then I will take you to play land
[12:32] we'll enjoy a lot, ok?
[12:34] shall we go tomorrow?
[12:35] how can we go tomorrow, my dear?
you are not well right now
[12:39] come on, take one more bite
[12:42] its yummy
[12:44] yes
[12:46] I am fine, don't worry!
[12:52] I know my dear that you are absolutely fine, but how can we go now?
[12:56] even your brother is not here, he is at granny's house
[12:59] we'll go together once he will come back, then we'll enjoy a lot. Ok?
[13:05] Okay done! But we'll also take Hania along
[13:08] Done! promise... 
[13:11] come on my child...
see, this is so soft
[13:13] I know its very soft, just like you. My doll
[13:18] you have to finish it all, ok?
[13:20] why are you getting worried? And see, I never wanted you to do this job
[13:25] a place where there is no respect, we don't do a job there
[13:28] its easy to earn respect in this era, than earning money
[13:34] if I kept thinking about respect, then I won't be able to move on in my life ever
[13:37] why do you think this way? I am with you
[13:40] to fulfill your every wish for life time
[13:45] my every wish has become a desire
[13:49] I have come too far in this race, Hamza
I don't see anything else except for needs
[13:54] mom's needs, sister's needs... my needs, that's it!
[13:59] Fabiha, you think too much nothing else
[14:02] See, everyone's life experiences difficulties
[14:06] and difficult time passes, it doesn't stops
[14:10] but we have to give it some time
[14:13] I can't wait, Hamza
[14:18] Ok fine, as it is it wasn't the last caretaker's job in this whole world
[14:22] there are many other houses too, they'll keep you on a job there
[14:26] talk to your agency
[14:27] I'm fired from my agency as well
[14:30] that ill-mannered woman had filed a complained over there too
[14:34] then, now?
[14:35] how would I know? I fear, if mom gets to know then she will get worried uselessly
[14:40] don't know how will I tell her
[14:42] No, there is no need to tell her anything right now
[14:45] let me make some arrangement for your job
[14:52] what happened to your hand?
[14:54] Nothing, its just a small injury
[14:56] how come? Come, get up. Let me get you a bandaid
[15:00] No, its a small injury Hamza. I'll be fine
[15:03] No, the injury doesn't heal itself. As I said, come with me. Get up
[15:08] give me your bag
[15:10] lets go
[15:45] Arham, I've been noticing since morning that you are not talking to me
[15:49] I know, the pain you've been through. I have suffered through the same pain
[15:55] say something please, talk to me
[15:57] what shall I say, Sanaya?
[15:58] I had called you so many times since morning, but you didn't receive a single one
[16:02] I was in a meeting, Arham
[16:03] which meeting? You had said that the meeting will be only one hour long but you took almost 2.5 hours
[16:06] at least, you could have informed me. I would have gone to Hareem
[16:09] so you want to say that I don't care about my daughter?
[16:11] Because of your carelessness!
it was your duty to call the van guy daily
[16:15] did you call?
[16:17] today, Hadi was all aloe at the school for 3 hours. Who is responsible for it, you or your brother's wife?
[16:21] tell me
[16:22] it was more important to reach hospital, Arham
Hadi is also important, Sanaya!
[16:27] we cannot loose one child for another
[16:29] and Hareem is in this condition, because she didn't get the medicine
[16:33] medicine.. 
[16:34] So you are trying to say that my mother didn't gave the medicine to Hareem on time?
[16:37] I haven't said this thing, but the doctor had. That Hareem got the fits because she wasn't given any medicine
[16:45] Arham
[16:47] for the past 2 years my family is taking care of our kids
[16:52] they did good with us, & this is how you are repaying them?
[16:56] so instead of arguing with me, why don't you ask your mother?
[17:00] did she gave her the medicine or not?
[17:03] you aren't saying this from your side
[17:07] I know you very well by now
[17:56] you are having severe hair fall nowadays
[17:58] it had to happen because I wash my hair from boring water
[18:01] not boring water, but the worries of two unmarried daughters on your shoulders is the cause of your hair fall
[18:06] oho... 
[18:07] Greetings mom!
[18:09] Greetings dear! How are you?
[18:11] I'm fine, how are you?
[18:13] hey! What is this?
[18:15] Nothing, it got cut by a glass
[18:19] isn't the wound deep?
[18:20] No, its fine. Hamza took me to the doctor
[18:25] may God bless Hamza with long life & protect from an evil eye
[18:29] he takes very good care of you as of yet
[18:31] dear look, value him a lot
[18:35] Blessed people get such life partners
[18:38] mom, I am so tired. I want to rest for a while
[18:41] Fabiha, I am also tired by working since entire day
[18:45] I have kept a few clothes on your bed, kindly fold them before going to sleep. Ok?
[18:52] what's wrong with you?
Are you tired of working?
[18:56] what's the big deal, if you'll fold a few clothes?
[18:59] what was the need to tell her this work?
[19:01] mom, will I become your dearest daughter if I also earn some money & keep on your hand?
[19:08] remove feelings for Haris from your heart, & become my good daughter once again
[19:18] come on
[19:20] pick up these things
[19:29] listen
[19:32] you didn't get ready?
won't you go to office?
[19:35] No, you had asked me to resign
[19:38] so I had resigned last night
[19:46] anyways, come quickly as the breakfast is served & its getting late
[20:12] I've told your wife
[20:15] Hadia is coming tomorrow, by night's flight
[20:18] tell her to take 10 to 15 days leaves. What if she refuses for the same
[20:23] my daughter comes here once in a year, and I don't want her to do the work after coming here as well
[20:28] she shouldn't face any problem
[20:32] tell her in your way, because a husband's words have more importance
[20:35] I will tell her, she will take the leaves
[20:37] is Sameer coming along?
[20:41] he wanted to come, but I told him not to
[20:45] why did you refuse him? He will mind it
[20:48] its better to refuse someone earlier, rather than calling them home & humiliate 
[20:52] a son-in-law's relation is much heavier than a daughter-in-law's relation
[20:56] one needs to give time, & serve them
[20:58] here, the family members of this house aren't at home until evening. So who will take care of the son-in-law?
[21:02] She will take the leaves, don't you worry at all
[21:07] the one who doesn't care about her daughter
[21:11] how will she serve her sister-in-law & her husband?
[21:16] now everyone is not like my Hadia
[21:19] who serves her mother-in-law from morning until night, to make her husband happy
[21:25] my daughter is coming for a few days to rest
[21:28] she shouldn't face any problem, just take care of it
[21:31] hey, take some curry
[21:34] give me, let me pour some
[21:36] Fabiha, tomorrow is the last date to pay the electricity bill. Do pay it tomorrow while going to your office
[21:44] what happened to you, why you look so pale?
[21:48] Fabiha
[21:49] yes? what?
[21:52] what as such is the grief that you are standing so lost?
[21:55] nothing! what will happen to me?
[21:59] really?
[22:02] Then tell me, what I had said to you a while ago?
[22:07] What did you say?
[22:08] tomorrow is the last date to pay the electricity bill.
[22:11] I've kept it on your side table, do pay it while going to your office
[22:14] and yes, the internet is also not working. Do pay its bill too
[22:18] I have to make a watsapp call to uncle
[22:21] why?
[22:24] come, sit here
[22:28] Haris's family came today
[22:30] but they were about to come tomorrow
[22:32] yes...
[22:34] Haris lost his job
[22:36] now he wants to go to Muscat
[22:38] mom will not talk to uncle, so I have to talk to him
[22:42] please pay the internet bill tomorrow, so that I can call him
[22:46] Okay?
please, my good sister
[22:49] please...
[22:51] I will see
[22:54] do remember it, ok?
[23:28] mom was telling me that Hadia is about to come
[23:31] do one thing, take a few days off from office
[23:34] its difficult to get the leaves
[23:38] why is it difficult?
[23:40] there are 30 days leaves in every organization, so what could be the problem?
[23:46] you are a professional yourself
[23:48] how can you talk to me like that?
[23:51] however, you know that I am working on a very important project. I am heading it
[23:55] do you want me to hold it & take 15 days leaves. How is it possible?
[23:59] so what's the big deal in it? Hand it over to someone else
[24:01] So, you want me to leave this project?
[24:03] if possible, then why not?
[24:10] Alright then, why only the project. Let me leave the job too
[24:14] As it is, your mother & sister doesn't like my job. So this will be fine
[24:20] yes, leave it
[24:21] if you cannot handle your responsibilities with household then leave the job
[24:26] Fine Arham, I will resign tomorrow
[24:29] Why tomorrow? Do it today, resign today. Its just a matter of an email
[24:43] Okay fine!
[26:00] Fabiha
[26:01] Fabiha
[26:03] dear, get up. You are getting late, don't you have to go today?
[26:07] no
[26:09] why?
[26:12] I am not feeling well, mom
[26:14] what happened to you?
[26:18] I am suffering with fever
[26:21] Okay, let me check
[26:26] do one thing, go to the doctor with Farheen & get some medicines
[26:31] No mom, I will take the medicine after breakfast. I will be fine
[26:35] your madam scolds you for coming late
[26:39] what if she fires you from the job if you will take a day off
[26:42] I have talked to my agency, they'll send someone else today in my place
[26:46] at least go to the doctor & get the medicines, you'll be fine
[26:49] No mom, there is no use of it.  
I will take the medicine after breakfast. I will be fine
[26:55] okay
[26:56] dear, actually..
[27:00] the landlord had visited
[27:03] he was asking for the rent
[27:07] tell him that we'll pay by next 2 days
[27:11] Why? its already 10th
[27:14] ask your madam to pay your salary
[27:18] yes, she has gone to Dubai. I will ask her as soon as she comes back
[27:26] mom, don't worry. I will pay the rent
[27:29] Okay... anyways
[27:32] I will talk to the landlord
[27:46] so the internet won't work today as well?

[29:35] yes
[29:36] Fabiha, your 20 days salary is ready. Please come to collect the cheque
[29:42] why only 20 days? When I had worked for an entire month
[29:45] and every month I get the salary in my account then why cheque this time?
[29:48] madam, our company have some rules. You get the last salary's cheque upon ending of the job
[29:53] please collect your cheque today
[29:57] end of job, means?
[30:04] Fabiha...
[30:06] why didn't you tell us that you had lost your job?

[30:13] you guys would have become worried for no reason
[30:15] and I am searching for another one, I will get it
[30:20] Please just don't tell this to mom
[30:24] why I shouldn't tell? Today I got a chance, she is so proud of her dearest daughter
[30:29] she should also know, how we'll run the house when one looses the job
[30:33] listen to me, sister!
[30:39] wait, don't tell mom please
[30:42] it will become a problem for no reason, what do you want?
[30:44] mom should also know that what her dearest daughter is doing, right?
[30:48] there is no need to do all this, listen to me
[30:51] mom... did you hear anything?
yes Mr. Rao, we'll pay you by 28th of this month
[30:54] did you hear something?
why are you worrying her?
[30:55] yes yes, don't worry
sister!
[30:56] hey, hang up the phone & listen to my news first
[30:58] I'll talk to you later
[31:00] what happened, why are you making so much of noise?
[31:01] do you know something? Not only this month, but you won't be able to pay the rent of this house next month as well
[31:06] why, what happened? What rubbish you are uttering, are you crazy?
[31:08] yes mom, you always find me wrong. But this time I am telling the correct thing
[31:12] this dearest daughter of yours, she lost her job
[31:15] what! she lost her job?
[31:20] what is she saying?
[31:22] you have lost your job?
[31:24] tell me, what I am asking you!
[31:26] why are you standing quietly? Tell mom
[31:27] let me see, how we'll run this house now without our job
[31:31] yes mom, I've lost the job. But don't worry, Hamza had talked to a few people. Soon I will get the job
[31:37] you had lied to me? Did you!
[31:40] I had just hid this matter from you, so that you don't get unwell. Nothing else
[31:44] Enough! I didn't get hurt because you've lost your job, but I got hurt as you had lied to me
[31:51] mom, I agree that I haven't lied to you ever
[31:54] but you would have become sick, if I would have told you
[31:57] oh!
[31:58] please don't worry, mom
I will get a job
[32:02] you've become so grown up now, that you'll lie to your mother on her face. Right?
[32:07] I keep telling everyone in our family that my daughter had never lied to me
[32:12] she had never let me down
[32:14] but now, you've let me down not in front of the family only but in front of this whole world
[32:18] mom... I made a mistake
[32:21] it won't happen next time, I promise you
[32:25] swear upon my life, right away
[32:28] mom, what's wrong?
swear upon me!
[32:30] ok fine, I swear upon your life. It won't happen next time, I will never lie. Please don't worry
[32:41] please sit here, come
[32:47] just now I had a word with Mr. Rao on the phone that he'll get the rent by 28th
[32:52] don't worry, I will manage
[32:54] from where you'll manage?
[32:56] I will manage it from anywhere, just don't worry. You'll get sick, mom
[33:00] my health may go to hell! I am worried that how I will manage this house expenses now
[33:04] everything will be done
[33:06] just don't take tension
[33:54] listen
[33:56] you didn't get ready?
won't you go to office?
[33:59] No, you had asked me to resign
[34:02] so I had resigned last night
[34:10] anyways, come quickly as the breakfast is served & its getting late
[35:26] have you left the job in real?
[35:28] yes
[35:33] look at me, then say it
[35:40] I took 2 days leave
[35:43] I don't take rational decisions like you, you know me very well
[35:49] Sanaya, its your right to get upset
[35:53] but if you won't express your anger, then how we'll fix everything?
[35:59] I am just your wife
[36:01] you have all the rights
[36:04] you signify them whenever you want to
[36:08] Arham, there is no importance of supporting someone when the other person doesn't realize anything
[36:19] come here, come to me
[36:34] yes, tell me
[36:38] Sanaya, I know the fact that we cannot run this house without your job
[36:43] still, I don't know what I had said last night in anger
[36:47] and I shouldn't have said that
[36:49] you do the same sacrifices for this house, like I do
[36:54] therefore, I shouldn't have done that to you
[36:59] Sanaya, you are as important to me as breathing is important to live but...
[37:04] what to do
[37:06] sometimes I get late in realizing it
[37:10] but I do understand
[37:12] I am nothing without you
[37:15] the way Mr. Meer (the poet) says..
[37:18] "I always get late"
[37:21] maybe, I do the same thing
[37:25] but then I do realize
[37:31] Arham, if a person gets a bit late
[37:35] then nothing is left except for regret
[37:37] I promise you that we'll never face regret in our lives
[37:43] To support each other, time is not important but love is
[37:50] what about time? 
Its good as well as bad
[37:54] but, if there is no love in good times
[37:57] and there is no support in bad times
[38:00] then a relation isn't nurtured but dragged
[38:05] Sanaya, I can promise you only thing. Whenever there will be a bad time, I'll always be there for you
[38:15] I will never leave your side
[38:19] always..
[38:22] always?
[38:24] always!
[38:26] forgive me, I am really sorry
now fix your mood
[38:33] okay
[38:37] Arham
[38:39] yes mom?
[38:40] have you brought my medicines?
[38:43] which medicines, mom?
You didn't tell me any medicine
[38:49] dear, didn't you tell Arham that my medicines are finished?
[38:56] mom, when did you tell me?
If you had, then why I wouldn't have told Arham?
[39:01] hey..
[39:02] what are you saying? 
Yesterday, I had told you that all of medicines are finished
[39:07] Okay, no problem. Tell me, I will bring them on my way back home
[39:11] leave it
[39:13] Hadia is coming, I will ask her to bring it
[39:15] mom, why will you tell Hadia?
 I am here, I will bring them
[39:21] nobody cares for me in this house
[39:25] however, you guys refute me
[39:29] only Hadia is concerned about me, she will bring it. No problem
[39:33] its not the matter. 
Give me this cup, come on
[39:36] Sanaya, make porridge for mom. Ok?
[39:40] Ok! Come with me, let me show you a video
[39:44] do you know Mr. Munir Niazi (the poet) says "I always get late:
