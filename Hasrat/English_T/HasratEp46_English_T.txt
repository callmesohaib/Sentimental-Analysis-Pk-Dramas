[02:30] You have compromised with your fate.
[02:35] Just pray that your children do it too.
[02:41] What it is about kids, mom? They'll forget everything in one night.
[02:54] They'll forget everything when they see a little kid laughing and playing.
[03:01] They won't remember anything. 
[03:05] My dear, don't forget yourself while making these sacrifices. 
 Don't worry about me, mom. I'll handle myself.
[03:24] And someone who has her mother's prayers with her. How won't she be happy?
[03:31] I cannot see you in any more pain, Sanaya.
[03:37] Come on, you come with us. 
 No mom.
[03:45] I will not go anywhere. I've thought things through before I made this decision.
[03:56] If I leave today, my children will be scattered. I'll not go anywhere.
[04:22] Sorry, mom..
[05:17] Arham.. being angry won't solve anything. 
 The kids, for whose future, I have been struggling day and night..
[05:30] Sanaya feels I'm not serious about their future.
[05:40] Thats why I am the one to be blamed.
[05:55] And is marrying for the second time, is it such a big sin? Am I responsible for everything?
[06:06] Do you think I don't care about my children or don't I love them? 
 Its neither yours nor Hadi's fault.
[06:16] It is only Sanaya's fault. She is responsible for everything. And Hadi is just a kid. He'll learn whatever he's taught.
[06:32] I accept whatever happened was wrong but you should know why it happened.
[06:48] I don't know Fabiha. 
 I do. I know everything. Sanaya is doing everything.
[07:00] If there had been any other kid in place of Hadi, he'd have done the same.
[07:08] What is Sanaya doing? 
 Sanaya is pressurizing kids to stay away from you, because of me. Thats the truth, Arham.
[07:21] Hadi told me himself that she's very strict with him. The kid will be scared Arham.
[07:30] You have no idea how scared he is.
[07:40] Fabiha, she is their mother, why would she do this? 
 Because of me. Why else? She's very hurt because you married me.
[07:52] And now she want to hurt you and drive the kids away from you.
[08:02] Hadi and Hareem are being negatively affected by everything, Arham. This is why they're misbehaving more and more everyday.
[08:15] They aren't getting any affection from their mother and they're losing their father as well. The kids are bound to do this.
[08:25] You'll have to think yourself about them.
[09:39] Do you have to discuss something else with me, other than Farheen? When I told you to leave one, leave. Don't you understand?
[09:54] Go!
[10:38] What is this? Will you not have it? 
 No. And even if I want it, I'll have it in my room.
[10:46] I won't disturb your privacy. 
 Sit here. I'm asking you to sit Hania.
[11:01] Sit down.. I'm sorry.
[11:10] I was very  rude with you. 
 You always do this. It isn't something new.
[11:21] I'm telling you I'm sorry. I was worried about work.
[11:31] And you know very well, it wasn't about office. I'm sure Farheen must have said something to you.
[11:42] Otherwise why would she call me and ask about you? 
 You've become way clever living with Farheen. 
[11:56] Think about it as so because respectable people cannot survive in this society.
[12:05] Thats why I tell you to not be so respectable. 
 So you want me to become a goon?
[12:14] Not a goon but at least become someone's reason to live.
[12:24] Oh well.. there's no use to make you understand. Farheen is right. 
 And what is she right about?
[12:35] God save the girl who comes in your life.
[12:43] You have started talking way too much. Go and start making arrangements for tonight. Sit, I'll go and see.
[13:01] Hello aunty. Come inside please. 
 I have a lot of complaints. I came myself or else you wouldn't have called me.
[13:10] No. Its not that. I was so busy working, it skipped my mind. 
 Of course it would skip your mind. See,
[13:17] you said it wasn't like this but it is so. 
 Please come and sit. Hania, aunty and Farheen are here. Come and bring some refreshments.
[13:27] The good news is that you still came even if you were upset with me and I'm indebted to you.
[13:37] I'll make it up to you, soon. 
 Its not like this, dear.
[13:43] Hello. How are you? Thank God you're here. I was waiting for you. Please come. 
[13:50] Where? 
 I need your help to choose a dress.
[14:02] Who is the boy? What does he do? 
 He has an import export business, aunty.
[14:10] He supplies things made of crystal. 
 Don't worry. I'll handle the guests.
[14:19] Its good that you came otherwise all this would have been difficult for me. 
 How could I not come?
[14:26] Hania is like Farheen.. just like my daughter. 
 Yes, it is so.
[14:32] You see if there is something missing or if we need anything else. I'll go and get it right away.
[14:37] I'll go and ask Hania if something is missing. Then I'll tell you. 
 Alright.
[15:05] See, what I brought for my Hadi. Your favorite sandwich. 
 No. I don't want it.
[15:18] Why? You were hungry. 
 Mom told me not to.
[15:34] But mom isn't home right now, you can eat it. 
 We shouldn't do anything secretly from mom.
[15:44] I'm telling you.. dad will talk to mom.. you can eat. 
 No. I won't eat or else mom will hit me.
[15:59] Mom warned us that we have to eat the curry and flat breads.
[16:09] Come on Hadi, lets eat.
[16:23] Sanaya is being harsh with the kids. She's dragging them in between without any reason. Whats their fault?
[16:33] The children are scared even when Sanaya isn't present. This isn't happening. Sanaya is the limit.
[17:22] Did you see with your eyes how scared Hadi was?
[17:30] He didn't eat his favorite sandwich.
[17:38] Think about it.. if a mother doesn't care about what her children like or dislike. Will she take time to take them away from their father?
[17:50] I'm not a mother but seeing all this pains me, Arham.
[17:59] If this keeps on, it won't be long before the children are away from you.
[18:13] Hareem is growing up and she understands the good and bad. This is why Sanaya only pressurizes Hadi.
[18:24] He is a kid and he is scared. Looking at Hadi, even Hareem is being affected.
[18:34] Sanaya has thought everything through before planning all this. 
 Fabiha I don't understand what to do.
[18:46] Should I give you an advice? 
 What advice?
[18:52] You should overtake Hadi's responsibility yourself.
[19:01] If you don't want his mind to be negatively affected, keep him with you.
[19:51] What happened? 
 Nothing.
[20:59] Now write it down and show me. Very nice.
[21:08] Which paper have you prepared for now? 
 Math.
[21:12] Very good. Very good. 
 Dad are you upset with me?
[21:19] No dear. Dad isn't upset with you. 
 Dad, I'm sorry. You had to face insult because of me in the school.
[21:29] But what could I do? I didn't like when someone sad bad things about my father.
[21:37] I know. Dad isn't upset with you. Don't think like this. You'll sleep with dad from today. 
 Yaay..
[21:52] Lets go. My dear.. 
 Where are you taking Hadi?
[22:08] Hadi will sleep with me today. 
 Hadi has always slept with me.
[22:21] Why did you think of taking Hadi along, all of a sudden? 
 Sanaya, I'm their father.
[22:32] I'll take him whenever I want to. I have this right. 
 You're passionately aware about being their father today.
[22:43] You couldn't see anything else other than Fabiha earlier. 
 This.. this is the trash in your mind that you're polluting the kids with.
[23:04] Sanaya please don't do this. They're very innocent. 
 And what do I want?
[23:11] Hadi will not stay with you, Sanaya.
[23:18] You are distancing the children from me because you're angry. 
 I know very well whose teaching you all this Arham.
[23:32] You snatched yourself away from me and now you want to take away my kids?
[23:37] So whats wrong in this? Its not wrong at all.
[23:45] You're polluting their mind. Accept it. 
 Arham, why would I pollute the mind of my own kids?
[23:57] She is only saying this to turn you against me. Nothing else.
[24:07] Remember this.. you'll regret it. 
 Sanaya, only time will tell whose right and whose wrong.
[24:17] Hadi will sleep with me and thats final. I don't want any more arguments.
[24:30] Hareem, do your homework. Come on Hadi.
[25:20] Hadi, you're here. 
 Fabiha aunty I'll sleep with you today.
[25:26] Why will you sleep here? 
 Because dad said I'll sleep with you.
[25:40] Fabiha, will you take care of me and play games with me?
[25:47] Tell me Fabiha aunty. Tell me..
[26:08] Fabiha aunty tell me.. 
 Hadi, be quiet and sleep!
[27:33] Hamza? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
[27:43] Thanks.. you take Hania as your own.
[27:52] Hania has no connection with whatever happened.
[28:03] But Hamza if you didn't like what I said, you could have been angry. Running away or hiding has no use.
[28:17] See, talking will solve problems and giving space increases love.
[28:27] If you're angry, you should express. And if you love someone, you should tell them.
[28:39] Farheen, you shouldn't have said that about dying for Fabiha. 
 I was right.
[28:51] And thats why you didn't like it. You couldn't digest the truth.
[28:59] Its not like that. 
 Alright. Whatever it is. I'm here because of Hania.
[29:11] No matter how you break our trust, I promised Hania and I cannot let her down.
[29:22] How do you think the boy is? 
 This is in your hand. Why are you asking me?
[29:38] As it is, my opinion doesn't matter to you. You think I'm Fabiha? 
 You can advise me as a friend.
[29:49] He's good but ask Hania once.
[30:00] Hmm.. 
 And listen Hamza.. don't mention our argument to Hania. She's already worried about you.
[30:13] Don't worry.
[30:26] What happened? 
 I was just looking at the tray.
[30:48] What is it? Did you have an argument with Hamza?
[30:55] No. No mom.. Nothing.
[31:39] Here's your fresh juice. Finish it fast. 
 I understand whatever you're doing.
[31:52] Don't think you can take away my kids doing all this. 
 You're mistaken if you think the kids will stay with you.
[32:06] The kids will stay where they get love.
[32:14] And do you remember, you told me you had nothing to lose? The day isn't far when you'll lose the kids too.
[32:27] Of course, if you leave the kids will leave with you.
[32:36] And if the kids leave with you, Arham will be worried and if Arham is worried, my happiness will be affected.
[32:47] Do you understand what I'm saying?
[32:53] Thats why its important that kids know that you're not responsible for them. They want their freedom and they'll get it with me.
[33:07] And of course, when you go to work, I'll handle the kids. But this activity will go on for a few weeks only.
[33:21] I already have the husband. The kids will soon be mine as well.
[33:32] I'm not scared anymore.
[33:42] I made the juice myself.
[34:00] Farheen? How much will you make Hamza wait for? 
 Mom, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
[34:07] Hurry up. What have you thought about the proposal Hamza?
[34:15] I was thinking to discuss with you once. Did you like the boy?
[34:26] I really liked him. You're mature enough now. 
 Even I liked the boy. Should I say yes?
[34:39] Of course. If you like him, why should you hesitate? Go ahead. 
 Had mom been here on this occassion..
[34:49] Hamza.. dear when mothers leave this world..
[35:04] even then, they don't forget their children. They pray on the skies.
[35:13] Aunty.. have you not been able to forget Fabiha, yet.. 
 The person who wounds you..
[35:37] its very difficult to forget them. Even if its your children. 
 Will you forgive Fabiha if I forgive her?
[35:56] Hamza.. what are you made of?
[36:04] You'll forgive the person who killed you?
[36:10] Mom used to say the person who forgives is better than the one who hurt you.
[36:24] I've forgiven her.
[36:31] You should also forgive her and allow her to come here.
[36:54] Farheen? 
 Yes mom. I'm here. Tea.
[37:01] Farheen, get ready fast. We'll leave then. 
 Just five more minutes.
[37:08] Please take something.
[37:27] Arham.. I was thinking since Hareem sleeps with Sanaya and Hadi sleeps with us, why don't we set up the kids room for our baby?
[37:41] He'll adjust with Hadi and Hareem too. 
 If you want, we'll decorate another room for our child.
[37:51] I wanted that. If we can set up the kid's room for our baby and shift the children to another room. What do you think?
[38:06] Alright. This isn't a bad idea. I'll talk to Mr. Amir. You decide how to renovate. Everything will be done.
[38:18] Thank you Arham.
[38:24] Ask Sanaya once.
[38:31] What if she minds? 
 Why should I ask Sanaya? Why would she mind?
[38:36] Arham, they are her kids. If we change without asking her, she'll mind. 
 They are not only her kids, but mine as well.
[38:46] And you shouldn't worry about Sanaya. I'm here. I'll handle everything. 
 Thank you.
[39:06] You think, forgiving Fabiha will allow you to throw her out of your heart and mind? 
 I'm trying that.
[39:19] Maybe I can forget her. 
 God knows if this is possible for you.
[39:27] Leave everything and tell me, I'm thinking to finalize a date for Hania next month.
[39:36] What do you think about it? 
 Its great news.
[39:43] She will get married very soon. 
 Alright then. Start preparing for the wedding.
