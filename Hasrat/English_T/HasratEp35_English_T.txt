[01:26] What happened to mom? Fabiha call the ambulance. What happened? 
 Mom...
[01:35] Mom.. 
 Brother.. what happened to mom?
[01:57] I'm sorry sir. She couldn't survive because of severe heart attack. She's no more.
[03:55] Everything happened because of me.
[04:00] Its not like that Arham. Don't blame yourself.
[04:09] So.. who else should I blame?
[04:17] The mother who taught me how to live with respect, I insulted her in two minutes.
[04:33] My mother left this world, upset with me.
[04:42] You'll see, I'll never be happy. 
 God forbid Arham. What are you saying?
[04:47] And mothers will never curse their children.
[05:10] I'm sorry. Leave me alone for a while, please.
[05:20] Please.. 
 I'll get you water.
[05:59] I'm getting the car. You people come. 
 Sure.
[06:10] The pain of losing your mother will never diminish even if someone lends you all their support.
[06:19] Thank you so much aunty. We need our family during such times. 
 Why thank me? Families come to the rescue in such times.
[06:30] Aunty.. please make Sanaya understand that this is her house.
[06:41] After all, a woman's real house is with her husband. 
 Mom, my phone is upstairs. I'll go get it.
[06:54] I'm Sanaya's mother and I know her pain well.
[07:01] I cannot see her like this. Sanaya is tolerating everything.
[07:08] Dear.. take care of yourself. Okay?
[07:17] Soumya.. I wanted to apologize to you as well. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened.
[07:27] Whatever happened, lets just forget it. Please pray for your mother. Lets go, mom..
[07:39] Let Sanaya come.. 
 She'll come mom. Junaid must be there.
[08:18] I forgot my phone. 
 Here..
[08:46] Please stay..
[08:53] I need you.. 
 If I had ever known..
[09:00] you were alone, I'd have never left.
[09:10] But you're not alone. 
 Can you see?
[09:27] I need you very much right now.
[09:37] Look at me.. I'm all alone.. Please..
[09:55] Please don't go..
[10:17] Arham, a person's own mistakes punish him.
[10:30] You drive away your loved ones so far away that when you need them, they're never there.
[10:49] I'm alone.. please.
[11:04] I can feel her presence very much. In this house. In this room. In your life.
[11:20] And even being so close to you.. I feel like a stranger.
[11:34] I'm standing here with a lot of difficulty. Who wants to suffocate to death?
[11:48] Take care of yourself. 
 Then stay back to take care of me.
[11:54] I'm not used to living without mom, Sanaya..
[12:07] I'm all alone now.
[12:14] Throw Fabiha out of your life. I'll come back forever.
[12:34] This cannot happen.
[12:44] I cannot leave her. 
 And me?
[12:52] Not even you..
[14:52] What happened? Are you missing your mom?
[15:03] What do you think? You'll regret and mom will forgive you?
[15:13] You should be ashamed brother. I've not even seen tears in your eyes.
[15:24] You've hurt mom.. 
 I didn't want to hurt her. I didn't intend to.
[15:40] But I didn't know how it happened.
[15:48] What would you do if you were in my situation? 
 You should have been patient. If a mother is upset, it shakes up the 7 skies.
[16:05] What happened after that? Mom took her pain with her.
[16:15] You should worry about your forgiveness. 
 You also think I'm responsible?
[16:25] You are a sinner. You are responsible for your mother's death.
[16:42] And if you want forgiveness, there is only one way out. 
 What?
[16:55] You will have to divorce Fabiha.
[17:04] Right now Sanaya has decided to leave you. Tomorrow, even your kids will leave you.
[17:16] What will you do then? Did you see mom?
[18:59] Close your eyes. 
 Why?
[19:02] Close your eyes. I didn't ask you for your life. 
 If only you had asked me for my life.
[19:11] If you're done, close your eyes. 
 Alright. Here.
[19:14] Don't open them. Keep them close. 
 What should I do now?
[19:17] I'm opening them. Its late. Will you push me down the roof? 
 Open them now.
[19:25] This? Where did you find this? 
 I just did.
[19:32] Do you know Fabiha.. its amazing to listen to classical songs with it. It'll make you fall in love again. This is priceless for me.
[19:43] The favors you've done for me, this isn't anything compared to it. If only you hadn't done me any such favors, I wouldn't have to buy such gifts.
[19:56] You're too much. 
 Do you like it?
[20:01] I love it but you don't. I know right now you want...
[20:48] If you remain like this, you'll never be able to move on in life.
[20:55] I don't have a reason to live.. I was stupid. 
 Its not important that you get the person you love. 
[21:05] And that too such a selfish person. Have you ever thought? Have you? What will become of me if something happens to you?
[21:19] Mom has already left. What will become of me? Should I tell you?
[21:24] I'll take poison and kill myself.
[21:26] Are you mad? I'm warning you. 
 Yes, I'm mad.
[21:29] Because you've gone mad. 
 See, don't you dare say such a thing again.
[21:32] I will. I will!
[21:34] Because you are still in love with her!
[21:39] And our whole family is destroyed because of this love!
[21:43] Just because of this. And that too such a selfish woman.
[21:48] For God's sake. Step out of your love life and look around. There's a lot happening around you.
[21:55] You have a sister in this house.
[22:00] Your mother is dead. Your love sacrificed your mother.
[22:05] Now I cannot sacrifice you.
[22:15] Let it be. You stay here. Celebrate this love.
[23:16] What happened Arham? Didn't you stop Sanaya mam?
[23:27] No. She's insistent upon not staying back.
[23:32] Should I talk to her? 
 No Fabiha.
[23:47] She isn't listening to her husband. How would she listen to his second wife? She has decided.
[23:54] She won't budge. 
 Did you ask her what she wants?
[24:01] She must have something in her mind. 
 She wants me to leave you.
[24:16] And what did you say?
[24:22] What do you think?
[24:34] Fabiha, you're my responsibility and I'll stick by my responsibility at all costs.
[24:43] But there must be some way. Something can be done.
[24:57] If only..
[25:02] I just have you..
[25:36] Throw Fabiha out of your life and I'll be back forever.
[25:47] I can't do that. I cannot leave her.
[26:42] Can I beat coffee for dad? 
 Hareem you'll spoil your clothes. Your uniform..
[26:47] Carefully.. I'll do it carefully. 
 Alright. Sit down and be careful. I'll fry your egg until then.
[27:10] What are you doing?
[27:12] I'm making coffee for dad..
[27:21] Very good.
[27:27] You're making this little kid beat coffee?
[27:32] Then you'll give her the responsibility of the entire house. You've struck a lottery.
[27:46] Hadia, Hareem insisted. 
 Hareem insisted?
[27:50] Tomorrow, she'll insist that you light the stove for her, would you do that? 
 What are you saying?
[27:57] The truth is always bitter.
[28:02] What do you think? Hareem is an orphan? She doesn't have parents?
[28:09] Why are you being atrocious to a little kid? 
 You're misusing my silence, Hadia.
[28:17] If I'm not saying anything, this doesn't mean you'll do whatever you please. 
 Or else...
[28:22] What will you do? 
 Or else I'll forget that you and I have a relationship.
[28:27] As if we have a relationship. Throw this misunderstanding out of your head. I or this house has no relationship with you.
[28:39] Remember one thing Fabiha.. a man can forget his wife but never his children.
[28:48] And its because of those children, Sanaya is standing on a firm footing in this house. And you'll hear her footsteps real soon.
[28:58] And you'll listen to my brother's changing decisions. And then you'll be out of this house.
[30:12] Hamza? Have you packed everything?
[30:18] Yes. 
 So where have you bought a house?
[30:29] If you don't want to tell me, its okay.
[30:39] Actually mom told me about Fabiha.
[30:45] How did you know about her wedding? 
 I don't want to talk about Fabiha, so please Farheen..
[30:52] If you want to discuss work, do it or else leave. Don't waste my time like your sister.
[30:59] Hamza.. I was just expressing my sympathies with you as a human being.
[31:08] Why are you forgetting that I'm going through the same pain you are?
[31:16] Oh well.. its your wish.
[32:06] Come in.
[32:11] These are loan files. You should check them once.
[32:17] And yes, I heard about your mother. My condolences. I'm sorry I couldn't attend the funeral.
[32:24] You know, family is the first priority.
[32:28] I understand. 
 I just had a son.
[32:31] All praise to the Lord. 
 You tell me, how are your wife and the kids?
[32:38] This Sunday its my son's aqiqah, you and your family has to come for sure.
[32:44] It won't be possible. I'm really sorry. 
 I won't hear a thing. You're coming.
[32:49] If you don't come, our friendship will end. 
 Alright, I'll try.
[32:56] Listen.. Congrats.
[33:00] Most welcome..
[33:18] Did you check these things? Is it there? 
 Yes.
[33:25] And this one?
[33:29] Farheen?
[33:33] You have to keep this one and this one stocked. 
 Farheen?
[33:44] Sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like this.
[33:51] Its alright. Hamza, I can understand your pain.
[33:59] I went to Sanaya mam's office to return the money. I found out there.
[34:08] I couldn't tolerate so I went to Arham's house.
[34:13] What? Did you meet Fabiha? How is she Hamza? 
 She's very happy and peaceful.
[34:22] I couldn't tolerate her peace. Now I'm uncomfortable.
[34:29] I never thought Fabiha could do this to me, Farheen.
[34:35] Hamza.. did your Sanaya mam accept Fabiha?
[34:42] Maybe.. What option did Fabiha leave for Sanaya mam?
[34:48] I cannot even curse her. I'll be the one in pain.
[34:54] Forget Fabiha.
[35:00] Hamza... see when Fabiha has moved on in her life, why don't you do it too?
[35:07] What will you get following a shadow? 
 I was under the impression that it was mine.
[35:54] Divorce papers? 
 Show me..
[36:13] Think about it once more, Sanaya. Don't take an emotional decision.
[36:25] Not only your life but two more lives are associated with Arham.
[36:35] And you cannot take Arham's kids away from him even if you want to.
[36:48] See Sanaya.. whatever your decision is.. we'll accept it. All of us are with you.
[37:04] I will just tell you to think before you decide anything.
[37:14] I don't want you to regret anything later. 
 Think about it once more Sanaya.. this is a big decision.
[37:28] There is nothing to think about, Soumya.
[37:36] There is peace in separation.
[37:41] If we live together, life will be difficult. It wasn't easy for me to take this decision either.
[37:48] But I took this decision to spend the rest of my life peacefully.
[37:55] A woman tolerates everything easily.. a man's temper, his agression and all decisions he imposes on her..
[38:04] But when it comes to sharing.. I will never accept that.
[38:14] If I compromise today, I won't be able to take any decision in the future, brother.
[38:22] Please send these papers to Arham.
