[01:42] Here you go.
[01:45] Anayah...
Shenaya my dear what has happened?
[01:51] Arhum has ousted me from home.
[01:52] Don't worry, you'll marry the place that you want to.
[01:57] Wherever I want?
[01:59] Yes...
Wherever you want.
[02:01] Are you sure? I don't want you go back on your words.
[02:05] I know how to fulfill my promises.
I've told Arhum my decision.
[02:11] Shenaya will not go in that house again. He's made enough mockery of Shenaya.
[02:24] How dare you oust my daughter?
[02:32] I'm her brother and I know. Ever since she lost her shares in the company...
[02:37] you've removed her from your life. You are a small man.
[02:48] You will not enter my life again. No man will treat a woman like you have treated my sister.
[03:29] I could never imagine Shenaya's brother to be so rude.
[03:37] Look at how rude he was... I could never imagine someone behaving like that.
[03:45] I'm sure Shenaya must have told them that she was the one who did everything for this house and that you didn't do anything for this house or your kids.
[03:57] The nerve of him!
[04:04] You know mother used to say this. Mother said that Shenaya used to tell her in-laws that she ran things here.
[04:19] I didn't believe my mother.
[04:26] I always followed and trusted what Shenaya said... but today her brother...
[04:40] After what her brother said has shown me my worth.
[04:46] I'm here, you can trust me blindly.
[04:55] I will never break your trust.
[05:02] We will we be very happy, Arhum.
[05:09] Where's Hadi?
[05:12] He was afraid, it was hard for me to put him to sleep.
[05:17] He's a kid, I know. He has his maths paper, look after him.
[05:24] Don't worry.
[05:42] Don't do this Shenaya. This is wrong.
[05:49] Nothing is wrong.
[05:56] I don't understand why you're making Shenaya understand after what happened.
[06:02] She can stay here for the rest of her life without a divorce.
[06:10] I've decided, I don't want to talk about this topic again.
[06:22] Arhum has only removed me from that house.
[06:26] But I've removed him from my heart.
[06:37] Shenaya, listen to me, try to understand.
I don't know what's the matter with you mother.
[06:46] Why are you pressurizing Shenaya to stake her life on that vile man.
[06:52] A life can put her life at stake, but not the life of her children.
[07:00] She might end things with Arhum, but not her children. He will always remain their father.
[07:06] But... when he comes here and takes them away.
[07:10] Then how will she tolerate that?
[07:16] Will I let my daughter stay here for the rest of her life?
[07:20] Really.... what if Arhum sends Shenaya the divorce papers?
[07:27] Arhum is free to make his decision...
[07:33] But not a mother!
[07:37] Look mother...
[07:40] She had become so independent that she can take care of herself and her children.
[07:50] Please don't force her.
[08:13] Auntie Fabiha, why was uncle hitting father?
[08:18] It's because your mother complained about your father to your uncle.
[08:25] The way mother complains about you to father, exactly the same way mother complained to your uncle.
[08:32] Auntie Fabiha, mother doesn't scold anyone.
[08:37] She lies... you get scolded don't you?
[08:42] You get scolded because your mother complains about you to your father.
[08:48] Have you ever been scolded because of me, no right?
Auntie Fabiha, why is mother doing this?
[08:57] She's doing this because she doesn't want to live with your father anymore.
[09:01] Will mother not ever come here again?
[09:06] Never...
Will sister Hareem be away from me?
[09:11] Do you want to go to sister Hareem?
Please call sister Hareem here.
[09:20] I'm trying to rid myself of her and he's talking about bringing his sister here. If Arhum finds out about this...
[09:33] You need not mention this to father, because he's angry right now.
[09:39] He's angry right now, he's scold you if you talk to him about this. He'll drop you off at mother's house, do you want that?
[09:44] No uncle's there...
Then don't talk to your father about this. Now finish your homework.
[10:10] Give me the presentation file from yesterday.
[10:12] Thank you.
[10:14] Good morning*
Am I late? Is the boss here?
[10:18] You're not late at all... the boss isn't here. Don't worry.
[10:20] Thank God! Send me Deluxe Group of Companies file to my office with a coffee.
[10:25] Alright.
[10:27] Good morning sir...
Good morning and congratulations! The Dubai client is happy with your performance.
[10:33] They want to do five year contract with our company.
[10:37] That's great news.
All of this is because of your hard work.
[10:42] That's why our office has organized a party with you as our chief guest. You must come here with your husband.
[10:51] Well done.
Congratulations!
[11:17] Let's make our egg...
[11:20] And... my son will then eat it... alright?
[11:42] Father, mother doesn't break an egg like this.
Oh really, then how does she do it?
[11:49] Give me here, let me make it.
[11:57] Hold it like this... then your break it like this.
[12:03] Then you put it here and then you start beating it.
[12:09] Wow... my dear child is very intelligent.
[12:16] But father isn't intelligent yet.
Father, you've not grown up yet!
[12:23] How will you cook when mother isn't here?
[12:25] That's why I'm training father, so that he knows how hard it is to live without me.
[12:30] Father doesn't know.
Where are you going?
[12:35] You won't leave.
What if I do?
[12:40] That will never happen.
[12:43] Give it to me, I'll make it...
[12:46] I'm making it.
I'm here, then why will you make it?
[12:50] Father, when will you grow up?
[12:53] How will you cook if mother leaves?
[12:57] I know how to... don't teach your father.
[13:05] What are you doing? What did you do?
I was making him an egg.
[13:10] I would have made it... come with me.
[13:15] I was focusing on something else.
Is Shenaya back from work.
[13:21] No... why are you asking? Here you go.
[13:25] I have a meeting with a lawyer.
[13:28] I will file a case for custody of Hadi and Hareem.
[13:34] Junaid... mother wasn't wrong.
[13:44] Alongside being a wife, Shenaya is a mother as well.
[13:50] A bride's  family is always afraid, that her happiness, her children...
[13:57] might be taken away from her. That's why they fear the very word of divorce.
[14:04] Do you think my sister will wait for Arhum for the rest of her life.
[14:10] Millions of women are.
[14:15] Shenaya will to.
Do you think Shenaya is taking the wrong decision?
[14:24] Junaid, I just want her to be happy.
[14:32] I don't want to lie to her, telling her that I'm supporting her decision.
[14:39] Look... I'm someone's daughter and sister.
[14:47] God forbid if this had happened to me, I would have gone to my mother's home.
[14:57] But... please leave this decision up to Shenaya.
[15:05] Only she the right to live wherever she want, however she want
[15:15] You're not wrong.
[15:53] What need was there for you to make Hamza make that call. Why did you mention our conversations to him?
[16:02] Mother, you never said anything to Fabiha when she used to tell everything to Hamza.
[16:10] Now that I've told you, you're on my case!
Have you gone insane? Why do you involve Fabiha in everything.
[16:19] When Fabiha was here everything she said goes.
[16:25] Now that she's left, Hamza has taken her place.
[16:30] But mother, in this time I've learned how to convince people.
You've gone insane.
[16:39] What was so wrong in meeting that man? We would have refused if you didn't like him.
[16:45] Why are you after me when I've told you that I don't want to marry.
[16:52] Why is it important to marry.
[16:56] You lived your life without a man, I will too.
That's easier said that done.
[17:05] It's hard to live without one.
[17:09] I had two children to spend my life with.
[17:16] Whom do you have?
Please don't get on my case, I don't want to marry.
[17:23] It's pointless talking to you. Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was refusing them?
[17:33] If you care about me that much, then do as I say/
[17:37] What do you want?
Something that isn't in my control
[17:44] What?
[17:51] Mother, it's nothing.
[17:55] You've gone insane.
[18:08] Shall we go inside.
No, you go ahead.
[18:17] I want to go as well.
Let her go, we'll go somewhere else.
[18:22] No, I want to go as well.
[18:27] Okay... let's go...
Alright I'm waiting.
[18:56] Mother, when Hamza used to take money from Fabiha...
[19:04] She used to agree with him, now that he's taking my side, you don't like him all of a sudden.
[19:10] Hamza doesn't have the same relationship with you as he had with Fabiha. So stop mentioning that.
[19:19] And yes... sooner or late you will be married.
[19:24] Note that down in your head.
[19:27] I might have maintained Hamza's respect this time...
[19:34] but I won't listen to him next time.
For God's sake mother, get off my case.
[21:25] Hello, Aliyah how are you?
How are you sister-in-law?
[21:30] You were late in picking up the phone, is everything alright?
[21:34] You didn't leave things great here.
[21:40] Nothing is well here.
[21:43] What do you mean?
[21:47] Did something happen? Did Fabiha say something to you?
[21:53] She had me removed from home to clear her path.
What?
[21:57] Brother ousted you from home?
[22:01] Yes...
What about the kids?
[22:06] Hareem is with me and Hadi is with Arhum.
You shouldn't have left Hadi there.
[22:15] One can trust one's father, but not a step mother.
[22:22] How could you leave Hadi behind? I might enforce my right on my husband, but not one someone elses.
[22:30] I don't think Hadi wants to stay there, I'll talk to brother Arhum.
[22:38] You have the same right as you do.
[22:42] I've forgotten all of my rights... I've forgotten everything. I don't want anything. 
[22:53] I'm just worried about my kids. Please bring them back to me.
[23:36] Hey, how are you?
I'm fine, how are you?
[23:44] I'm perfectly fine.
Father, do you miss me?
[23:48] I miss you a lot...
What about mother?
[23:55] Who permitted you to be here? Get out!
[24:01] You've made a mockery of your honor... why are you doing the same for us? Get out!
[24:12] Fabiha...
[24:14] It's good you're here.
[24:20] Mother has been on my case since morning.
[24:25] I was unable to convince her. The broke the stick while doing so...
[24:30] The snake died without you breaking the stick.
[24:34] That's exactly what I mean.
[24:39] How let you in?
[24:47] Who let you in? Get out of here!
[24:53] You've made a mockery of your honor. Do you want to do the same to us?
[25:00] Have you sworn to kill your mother?
[25:07] One doesn't want to marry and the other ran away from home.
[25:10] Get out of here.
[25:16] Get out!
Mother, you can be as angry as you want.
[25:24] Do and say whatever you want to say but please...
[25:28] don't do this...
Not one more word.
[25:33] Go back on your merry way and take him away.
[25:42] Get out! You won't listen to me this way.
Get out of here!
[26:05] I'll be waiting in the car... come on Hadi...
[26:26] What's the matter with you? Arhum is your son-in-law. Fabiha might be his step mother, but he's his father, he wouldn't have liked that.
[26:33] To hell with him!
[26:36] What's the matter with you mother?
[26:42] Enough... how long will you stay upset?
I will not forget.
[26:51] This will be a stamp on my heart.
[26:56] It will be a stamp.
Sit down mother...
[27:11] Who asked you to be so angry? You will only increase your blood pressure.
[27:18] Enough mother... sister... bring water for her.
[27:23] Because of you people I'm in this state.
[27:29] Enough.
[27:34] Forgive your daughter.
[27:39] Mothers are able to forgive their children a thousand times and you're unable to forgive me just this once...
[27:51] Forgive me.
[28:06] If you want I'll ask Hamza's forgiveness as well. I'll do as you say, please forgive me.
[28:12] He forgave you.
[28:17] He proved that he's my son...
[29:04] Yes Hadia?
Hello
[29:07] What's the matter? Are you that upset with your sister?
[29:15] You didn't call me once... you didn't ask me how I was...
[29:20] It's nothing like that.
[29:25] I was busy with work.
Was it work, or home?
[29:34] It was not right for you to remove sister Shenaya from home.
[29:39] Hadia, hang up if you're supporting Shenaya.
[29:44] Sister Shenaya was right about you, you've gotten used to taking emotional decisions.
[29:55] Even mother and I didn't know you that well... sister Shenaya was able to in a few years.
[30:04] Brother, if you're late even a little bit...
[30:08] then there's nothing left but regret.
[30:14] And now you don't have a mother or a sister to share your sadness with.
[30:24] The girl you're doing this for will all come to bite you in the back.
[30:36] The day you lose your money is the day you'll lose your love.
[30:46] I don't want anything bad to happen to you. I don't want you to regret things.
[30:53] I'll talk to you later, I can't speak right now.
Listen to me...
[30:59] For you and Hadi it would be better if you leave him with his mother.
[31:06] A single mother can raise her children better than a single dad.
[31:57] Here are your noodles...
[32:18] For Hadi and you it would be better if you leave Hadi with his mother.
[32:25] A single mother can raise her children better than a single dad.
[32:53] Arhum...
[32:59] Why aren't you eating?
[33:31] Work well on your paper and start the paper in the name of the Lord.
[33:40] Here's your bag, shall we go?
I was on my way.
[33:46] It's nothing... I've taken care of it. We're getting late.
[34:17] You're placing it wrong, you need to place it in the back aisle. You should concentrate on working rather than talking.
[34:25] How are you?
I'm well..
[34:27] You're running late... hurry up.
I know... the bus came in late today.
[34:39] What are you doing? You scared me!
How's your hand...
[34:45] It's better than before... you tell me... what did you make of the relationship?
[34:50] Why? What will you do after knowing?
I'm just asking...  if it's a yes, I'll start dancing.
[35:04] There is one thing... your one call made mother change her mind. You're very lucky for me.
[35:11] That doesn't sound like a thank you!
[35:17] Yes Mr. Hamza... thank you very much.
[35:21] That's better. You're welcome.
[35:24] You might think it's funny, but you can't imagine what mother did to me after your call.
[35:29] Thank God Fabiha was there, otherwise...
[35:36] Why you go so blank when you hear Fabiha's name?
[35:41] Now dance... if you want I can dance with you...
[35:44] Was that a joke?
Yeah so?
[35:49] Go and change... you're running late...
[36:09] Let's go my dear... read your questions before answering them.
[36:14] Okay...
Good luck* Bye*
[36:18] Bye...
[36:23] Take care  and don't bother the teacher.
[36:31] Go ahead... bye.
[36:35] Hey... how are you?
I'm well, how about you?
[36:43] I'm fine...
Do you miss me
[36:47] I miss you a lot.
[36:49] I miss you more than most.
What about mother?
[36:58] I miss your mother as well.
Then why don't you cheer her up?
[37:04] She's upset with me right now, but I'll cheer her up.
[37:14] And father misses you... now go inside and do well on your paper...
[37:19] Be sure you do it well.
Bye*
[39:03] What's the matter? Did you not go to work today?
[39:07] No...
What's the matter? You look worried.
[39:15] It's nothing like that.
[39:18] Arhum, I've been noticing you've been in an off mood since yesterday, are you upset with me?
[39:23] Do you think I should be upset with you?
Isn't it enough that I know your upset?
[39:30] Your mother is upset with you...
[39:37] Why did she take it on Hadi?
She got emotional...
[39:47] She ousted me from home as well and her child...
[39:56] Not once did she think where I would go in the night.
[40:01] It's not like that... 
[40:09] I just have one request, Hadi won't go there again.
