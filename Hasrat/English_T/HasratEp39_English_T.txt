[01:16] Make space and keep this bag. Hadia come we're getting late for the airport. Come Muskaan.
[01:36] What were you doing? 
 Nothing.
[01:41] Hadia, your brother doesn't have time to see you off. Come. We're getting late. Come Muskaan.
[02:00] Come dear.. Hadia..
[02:14] You're upset with me and leaving? 
 Yes. I'm upset and leaving.
[02:29] Do you know brother..
[02:34] when daughters leave their father's and brother's house upset, their brothers are never happy.
[02:46] I'm just afraid of this.
[03:03] Hadia, I don't know what I said to you when I was angry. Please I'm really sorry. Don't be upset.
[03:13] Brother, we get upset with the ones we love.
[03:21] And, I have nobody who loves me in this house.
[03:38] Bye.
[04:18] Mom, Hamza took me to have ice cream. 
 Oh wow. What was the happy occasion?
[04:24] You should ask Hamza about that.
 Whats the occasion you're celebrating with ice creams?
[04:30] I got a promotion today and a car from the company.
[04:41] Here mom.. your breakfast.
[04:47] Mom? What happened? Where are you lost? 
 Nothing. I was just thinking..
[04:54] When a man has a woman in his life, his fate changes.
[05:00] Ever since Fabiha left Hamza, Hamza's luck has sky rocketed.
[05:11] Fabiha didn't have true love in her fate, neither did she have peace.
[05:17] She will now keep burning with her desire when Hamza has another woman in his life.
[05:25] Mom.. when God didn't create Fabiha and Hamza in a pair, what could we do?
[05:34] You shouldn't worry about Hamza getting married. He'll marry when he's ready. 
 He'll only be able to forget Fabiha, when there will be someone else in his life.
[05:47] I'll ask Sumbul to send me some pictures of girls.
[05:54] Maybe he'll like a girl from them. Then, you, I and Haniya will go with a proposal and get him married.
[06:08] I think Hamza is here. Mom, we'll leave for work. 
 Dear, you didn't even have tea.
[06:14] I'll have it in the office. We're getting late. Take care. Bye.
[06:59] Hello. 
 Hello.
[07:02] Hamza drop me at the bus stop on our way back, today.
[07:06] Why? Is everything alright? Why on the bus stop? 
 Yes. I have to go to the market for something.
[07:12] Yes. Which market? 
 This mall nearby. I have to come here.
[07:18] So I'll take you. 
 Hamza, why will you be disturbed because of me. I'll go myself.
[07:25] Farheen, I like to help family. Can we go now?
[07:47] Hello mom.. 
 Hello? Where were you? I've been calling you since long.
[07:55] Yes actually I went to drop Hadia to the airport. 
 Yes, Soumya told me.
[08:02] That's fine. You tell me are you okay? Is everything okay between you and Arham?
[08:11] Yes mom. Everything is fine. 
 Does he give you time? Does he take care of your needs?
[08:20] Yes mom, he does. 
 You're lucky that he values you over the other woman.
[08:29] This mean, he loves you, dear. And now its your duty to return his love, with love.
[08:39] God knows, which mothers teach their daughters the wrong thing. A man is a leader.
[08:47] No matter what he does wrong, its a woman's fault in the end.
[08:54] You cannot change his natural instinct.
[09:02] A husband also values his wife as much as a wife values her husband.
[09:11] You should treat Arham like you used to. With the same love and same care. Understand?
[09:23] There's a meeting being called, mom. I'll talk to you late. Bye. 
 Alright. Bye.
[09:42] You know we're working people. Friendship and bosses don't mix.
[09:48] There are some rules of the bank that we cannot change.
[09:53] The same rules are for me as well. You will have an idea how much time it takes to approve a loan.
[10:04] But I'll get your case processed but keep in mind that it will take about two months.
[10:10] Yes, I understand. Thank you. You're so busy but still you managed some time for me. Thank you.
[10:19] Its alright. Why are you embarrassing me? 
 I'll leave mow.
[10:23] Why? Have tea with me. 
 No, thank you. One second..
[10:31] Yes Farrukh?
[10:36] Handle it for a while. I'm coming. I'll leave now, I have a call from work. 
 Sure. See you.
[11:02] What do you think? You'll destroy everything and I'll compromise? Don't even think about it. I built this house with love and your greed destroyed it.
[11:15] Whether I get Arham or not, but you'll not stay in Arham's life for long. I promise you.
[11:24] The speed at which the kids are being detached from me, this way Sanaya will also take Arham away.
[11:37] And I'll not let this happen. I need to keep the kids close to keep Arham close.
[11:57] Fabiha didn't have true love in her fate and neither peace.
[12:03] She will keep burning with her desires when Hamza has another woman in his life.
[12:13] How are you Farheen? 
 I'm fine. How are you?
[12:17] You had a shift upstairs. Has it changed again? 
 It didn't change. I got it changed.
[12:24] What do you mean? I don't understand. 
[12:27] Can I ask you a personal question?
[12:31] Yes sure.. 
 How is Hamza related to you? You come and go with him. Is he your brother?
[12:40] Why are you so concerned about Hamza? Who is he to me? Who I come and go with, shouldn't concern you.
[12:47] Mind your own business. Why do you keep an eye out for others? 
 Oh, I was just asking.
[12:56] To tell you the truth. I like Hamza. I want to talk to him.
[13:02] I thought I'd ask you. You might give me a favor. But you're more possessive about him than me.
[13:12] What's the scene? But you and him have a big age difference.
[13:19] Stay in your limit, or else. 
 Is everything alright?
[13:22] Hamza, please leave from here.
[13:26] Farheen, let me talk. What happened Faryal? 
 Nothing. I'll tell you. You leave from here.
[13:31] Oh but wait.. What happened? 
 I'll tell you. Why do you have to talk to her? Come.
[13:37] Listen to me.. 
[13:44] A wife is as important to a husband as the husband is important to his wife.
[13:52] You should be treating Arham like before. With the same love and care.
[16:08] The kids aren't home yet? Soumya? Soumya? 
 Yes?
[16:16] Why haven't Hareem and Hadi here yet? Its been more than half an hour. Do you have the van driver's number?
[16:22] Call him. 
 No mom. I deleted it. 
[16:27] I'll call Sanaya and ask. 
 Please do.
[16:53] Sanaya, isn't answering. She must be in a meeting. How will we know about the kids now?
[16:59] Wait. Let me call. 
 Okay.
[17:10] Yes Soumya? 
 Sanaya, the kids aren't home yet.
[17:14] The kids aren't home yet? I'll ask. 
 Yes please then tell me.
[17:26] She's telling me. Don't worry. 
 Yes. They should be here by now.
[17:36] Where are the kids? 
 Mam, she was insisting to take the kids along.
[17:43] How can you just send the kids with someone else? You should have informed me at least.
[17:58] Arham, where are the kids? 
 They are with Fabiha.
[18:12] So tell me what was Faryal telling you? 
 I told you she said nothing. Why are you chanting her name?
[18:18] Why are you fighting? There is something she said that irritated you so much. Oh well...
[18:25] Its up to you. Don't tell me if you don't want to. 
 Really? She likes you.
[18:31] She wants to talk to you. Do you want me to get her number for you? 
 Yes. Of course.
[18:37] Go. She is in the crockery section. Go and take her number. Why are you making me act like a messenger?
[18:43] Whats wrong with you Farheen? Why are you so irritated? And why are you arguing with her because of me? Are you mad?
[18:51] And even if she likes me. Its not her fault. I am so handsome. 
 Are you done?
[19:04] Nobody can take Fabiha's place.
[19:10] Hamza.. Fabiha's chapter is closed. She has moved on in life. Please, you also move on.
[19:34] Fabiha's chapter is closed. She has moved on in life. Please you also move on. 
[20:11] Did you enjoy? 
 We had a lot of fun. Mom.. will you take us out again?
[20:20] Of course, we'll go and next time we'll take you dad along too.
[20:26] Yes. Then I'll show them my stickers as well. Mom! Mom's here.
[20:32] Mom, do you know, mom took us to play area and then I got this sticker.
[20:39] And mom bought us all these toys too. 
 Quiet! Silence!
[20:53] I told you not to.
[20:59] You will only come home on the van except mom. You didn't take mom's permission and came with someone else?
[21:09] Mom.. she's our mom too.. 
 She isn't your mom! Do you understand?!
[21:20] And you.. how dare you get my children without my permission?
[21:29] I was just.. 
 I don't want your clarifications. Get out of my house. Right now. I don't want you near my children!
[21:38] Get out. 
 You cannot throw me out of my husband's house!
[22:47] What are you doing? 
 Ask your husband to find another place for you!
[22:52] Sanaya listen to me. Sanaya!
[23:02] Sanaya, open the door. Where will I go? Why are you doing all this?
[23:07] Sanaya, open the door. What are you doing? People are watching. Open the door, please.
[23:22] What happened? 
 Sanaya...
[23:40] If I see you near Fabiha aunty, you'll see the worse of me. Do you both understand?
[24:07] I am a woman but I'm not weak.
[24:23] You will not hit me while your other wife is watching!
[24:32] Sanaya, what about what you're doing? 
 Whatever a mother should be doing.
[24:37] She took my permission. 
 My permission is important as well. They are not only your children.
[24:43] My permission is as important as yours.
[24:50] Sanaya, she's my wife. She has the same respect as you in this house.
[24:57] So please.. 
 If she's your wife, don't ask her to mother my children!
[25:05] If she roams around my children after today..
[25:11] I'll not hold back. 
 Do you know she cannot answer back? But she tolerates for me.
[25:17] She loves me. Why can't you adjust? I didn't commit a sin marrying for the second time?
[25:22] No. I'm the one who committed a sin. I loved you and you punished me like this..
[25:28] I never thought about it.
[25:35] I have been patient about you but the children are mine.
[25:47] If I see her near my children again..
[25:58] Come on both of you. 
 You're wrong.
[26:04] Fabiha..
[26:41] Mom, are you crying?
[26:48] Please, don't cry.
[27:02] Here, drink some water.
[27:07] Mom is alright. Don't worry. Come here. 
 Mom..
[27:14] Are you upset with us? 
 Not at all my dear.
[27:20] How can I be upset with you? Mom isn't angry at all. Okay? 
 Okay.
[27:28] Mom, we are really sorry. Please.
[27:35] Please don't cry. 
 Its okay dear. Mom is alright. I'm not crying. Don't worry.
[27:43] Come to me. Both of you. Mom isn't upset at all.
[29:38] Fabiha, what are you doing? 
 I shouldn't have come in your life. Ever since I married you, I've been insulted.
[29:46] Where are you going? 
 I'll go anywhere, Arham.
[29:54] Fabiha, listen to me carefully. You're not going anywhere.
[30:00] And this isn't my decision but my order. 
 Don't you see she hates me so much? How will I make a place in her heart?
[30:10] Who is asking you to do that? 
 So will we keep fighting?
[30:15] I want to live with everyone together. I want to build a home. 
 Nothing will be alright so soon Fabiha.
[30:22] I think it never will be. What mistake did I make if I took the kids outside?
[30:27] What is wrong if they spent some good time? I used to take care of them earlier.
[30:33] Now Sanaya wants me to leave the kids alone. 
 Then do it.
[30:40] For some time. Stay away from the kids and Sanaya. 
 What are you saying?
[30:47] I cannot stay away from the kids. We're attached to one another. What are you saying?
[30:53] Fabiha, try to understand. Sanaya is right too. Its difficult to adjust for her.
[31:01] Please for my sake. Stay away from Sanaya and the kids. I promise you, everything will be alright.
[31:14] Now keep this back.
[31:26] Listen.. lets go for dinner tonight. Okay?
[31:34] Relax. Won't you smile?
[33:31] Hello mom. 
 Hello. Did you get your salary?
[33:37] You shopped so much. Do you know how much bill we have?
[33:42] How much? 
 7000.
[33:44] 7000? How did we use so much electricity to get such a hefty bill?
[33:51] Thats what I'm telling you. Did you save something or spent everything?
[33:58] All this.. Hamza has been promoted, mom..
[34:03] So he got you and me a gift.
[34:11] See this.. this is for you. 
 Why did you have to spend so much?
[34:20] Didn't you tell him no? Why did you let him spend so much? 
 Farheen said no to me.
[34:25] But this made me happy. Can I not buy something for my mother? 
 Mom, do you know, after his promotion,
[34:33] Hamza's salary has tripled. Hamza's days have changed. 
 This is great news.
[34:45] Now when you call me your mother and think of me as one. Do your duty as a son. I won't hear no.
[34:54] Whatever you order. Tell me what it is. 
 See this.
[35:00] These are a few pictures of girls that I've chosen for you. Look at them and then we'll talk.
[35:13] Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Fabiha..
[35:20] Happy birthday to you..
[35:30] Do you have an affair with him? 
 Yes. I do have an affair with him. I love him!
[35:36] I don't want to live with you. What will I do living with you? What will you give me? Poverty? Hunger?!
[35:46] I have already freed myself from this relationship since long and its best if Hamza does it too.
[35:54] But.. 
 There's no room to say no.
[36:00] Actually I don't want to get married before Haniya does.
[36:09] Haniya is very young. We'll get her married when its the right time. We should think about you first.
[36:29] I'll think about it. I'll leave now. Please allow me. Bye.
[36:40] Mom.. why did you have to discuss this with Hamza right now? He seemed so disturbed.
[36:44] But we have to get him married. He should settle down.
[38:20] Ouch.. 
 Sanaya, show me..
[38:32] You have done your part clearing my path of thorns.
[38:38] I don't need anymore sympathies. 
 Sanaya, you're bleeding. Sanaya listen..
