[01:13] If you again did this in front of dad then I will ask him to kick you out of this house.
[01:19] Where will you go then?
[01:21] I have a very beautiful relation with you.
[01:24] I have one and only brother.
[01:28] And I don't want to lose my brother.
[01:34] If we will live far from each other then this relation will remain beautiful.
[01:39] But if we will live together then this relation will end.
[01:41] So you will marry to the girl of my choice?
Yes, tell me the name of that girl.
[01:46] Marry me.
[01:55] Farheen
[01:59] Farheen, wake up. Won't you go to office today?\
[02:02] Farheen
[02:05] Get up, Hamza must be coming soon. Get up.
[02:08] I don't want to go to office. Let me sleep mom.
[02:13] But tell me the reason for not going to office.
[02:18] Your salary will be deducted if you won't go to office.
[02:23] And Hamza must be on his way, get up.
[02:26] Hamza won't come so don't wait for him.
[02:30] But why?
[02:34] I am asking, why won't he come?
[02:37] Mom, he is not feeling well.
[02:39] Let me sleep. I get up myself when I have to go to office.
[02:43] You must be hiding something from me.
[02:48] I am your mother.
[02:52] Don't embarrass me like Fabiha.
[02:58] I don't have any courage now.
[03:04] That I can face humiliation in front of others.
[03:11] For God's sake.
[03:15] Look at me.
[03:18] I am begging in front of you.
[03:23] At least think about my happiness as well.
[03:29] You keep mentioning your dignity and honor all the time.
[03:33] I am not going anywhere so don't worry.
[03:48] I think Hamza has arrived.
[03:52] He has come but you said that he won't come.
What?
[03:56] But why did he come?
Get up and get ready otherwise he will have to wait for you.
[04:48] How are you my son and how is your preparation for exam?
[04:53] Did your dad help you in studies?
No.
[04:57] What's the matter my son?
[05:00] Has anyone said anything to you? Has dad scolded you?
[05:03] No
[05:06] Then what's the matter?
[05:09] Why are you so scared? Are you hiding something from mom?
No.
[05:15] Very bad.
[05:16] Don't hide anything from mom. Tell me what's the matter.
[05:21] I didn't play any video game yesterday but even then aunt Fabiha complained in front of dad that I played video game and didn't prepare for exam.
[05:30] And when dad went to office then she scolded me so much and told me to get out of the house.
[05:37] Oh dear, aunt Fabiha said that.
[05:44] It's OK. You don't have to be afraid of aunt Fabiha because mom is with you and dad is also with you.
[05:50] But you shouldn't be rude to her. OK my son? Everything will be alright. Don't worry.
[05:56] Mom, can I go with you?
[06:01] I promise you my son that you will go with me very soon.
[06:04] But I can't take you right now.
[06:07] As you know that dad starts to shout at uncle house.
[06:11] But it's mom's promise that I will take you very soon.
[06:14] OK?
OK.
[06:17] Have you checked your bag? Have you got everything?
[06:20] No but I asked aunt Fabiha to give me a pencil but she didn't give me.
[06:26] It's OK, sister has an extra pencil. You have that extra pencil so give that to your brother.
[06:32] Read the paper thoroughly and do you remember what did I say to you?
[06:37] Let's go. Good luck. Bye.
[06:54] Greetings. Is everything alright? You have come early morning.
[06:58] Yes, Arham was going to office so I thought that I should spend some time with you so he dropped me here and went to office.
[07:06] Where is sister? Has she gone to office?
No, she hasn't gone to office. She is sleeping.
[07:13] Oh I see.
[07:15] She came late last night. Right?
[07:18] When did she come back?
[07:20] She came late because Hamza's car got faulty.
[07:26] Oh really?
[07:33] But I saw both of them in a restaurant last night.
[07:42] And she told you that his car got faulty.
[07:47] What?
[07:51] I went to restaurant with Arham last night then I was surprised to see both of them.
[07:56] That was a very expensive restaurant.
[08:04] I am surprised. I thought that you must have known about that.
[08:09] Sister Farheen doesn't hide anything from you.
[08:18] Oh, maybe she went there after your permission.
[08:22] Maybe she told me in the morning but I forgot.
[08:29] If she is hiding anything then there must be some reason. Didn't you ask her?
[08:38] What should I ask?
[08:40] That why didn't she tell you and why did she lie to you?
Well, just leave this topic.
[08:46] Will you take tea? 
[08:49] No mom, I don't want to eat anything these days and I have stopped taking tea long ago.
[09:05] What's up Arham
[09:09] OK. OK bye.
[09:15] What did Arham say?
[09:18] I have become a maid of his children.
[09:22] Their mother has left but responsibility of her children is on my shoulders.
[09:27] And he keeps asking me for making sandwich all the time.
[09:33] Aunt Fabiha help me in doing homework, I want to sleep Fabiha aunt. Fabiha, Fabiha, Fabiha
[09:41] And Arham is also very worried about his children.
[09:46] And on top of that he is so sharp that he complains against me in front of his father.
[09:54] Her mother must have taught him that's why he does so.
Fabiha.
[09:59] Why have you become so stern?
Mom, I want to spend my life peacefully with Arham.
[10:07] I don't want to put extra burden on myself by taking others' responsibilities.
[10:15] Arham only cares about his children.
[10:28] Listen my dear, if you will take care of that child then Arham will take care of you.
[11:11] Somiya
[11:15] What happened?
When did you come?
[11:18] What were you thinking? Is there anything to worry about? What's the matter?
[11:23] No, nothing.
[11:26] Everything is alright.
[11:28] Nothing has happened but you look worried and thinking about something.
[11:36] What's the matter?
[11:39] No Junaid, there is nothing like that. I was just thinking.
[11:44] Oh so now you will hide from me.
[11:51] I don't know Junaid.
[11:57] I am scared after seeing Sanaya's behavior.
[12:04] I am considering myself weak being a woman for the very first time.
[12:19] But why are you afraid?
[12:25] Won't you change like brother Arham?
[12:34] After all you are also a man.
[12:39] There must be so many girls in your life.
[12:53] Are you crazy?
[12:57] What are you talking about?
[13:00] Don't you trust me?
I trust you Junaid.
[13:07] But Sanaya also trusted brother Arham. Right?
[13:12] But what did she get by trusting him?
[13:16] Don't compare me with Arham, please.
[13:21] I am not comparing you Junaid.
[13:25] I am just telling you that after all you are also a man.
[13:32] Junaid, promise me that you will never break my trust.
[13:42] Swear on the name of Anaya.
What happened?
[13:49] Somiya I can't live without you.
[13:53] I swear on Anaya's name and on your name.
[14:10] I can't even imagine of betraying you.
[14:14] I trust you.
[14:20] But it's your responsibility to keep my trust in tact.
[14:36] Promise.
[14:42] Let me bring something for you.
[14:52] All siblings live together sister. I am not happy without you sister.
[15:02] I am not happy as well without you Hadi.
[15:07] Mom goes to office in the morning then I spend my time alone.
[15:15] I can't do anything with my consent. I can't even watch TV.
[15:20] Mom says, that house is mine but I don't think so.
[15:28] I can't even touch anything because if anything breaks then mom will feel embarrassment.
[15:37] Why have our parents separated from us sister.
[15:41] Because of aunt Fabiha. Aunt Fabiha has snatched our parents from us.
[15:47] That's why dad lives with her. Hadi, go with me.
[15:53] No, uncle is in that house. If you will go to our house then we will have so much fun.
[15:58] No, I don't want to go there because aunt Fabiha lives there.
[16:02] She scolds me so much. I don't want to go there.
[16:07] Will we always live separately from each other?
[16:12] No one cares about us.
Do you know that I slept in hunger one night.
[16:19] Dad doesn't care about me at all. He only takes care of aunt Fabiha.
[16:24] He doesn't take care of me. He scolds me and always remain in angry mood.
[16:30] I can't say anything to him because he doesn't even listen to me.
Well, I have a plan.
What's that?
[16:39] I will call you at midnight on dad's mobile from mom's mobile so receive my call.
[16:50] What are you discussing candidly?
Nothing. Nothing mom.
[16:54] Didn't you dad come to pick you?
No.
[16:59] He will come if he will get some spare time from his second wife's services.
[17:03] How much more will you spoon feed children against me?
[17:10] Why don't you take them once for all so that my problem may resolve.
[17:14] I don't want to leave my children with you.
[17:19] I understand everything. You provoke your son daily so that Arham may make my life a hell.
Oh so your bad time has come.
[17:31] That you are afraid of children.
I am not afraid. I am advising you.
[17:37] Children are suffering for no reason because of your jealousy.
[17:42] I am afraid they will stand against you.
[17:45] So it would be better for you to stop provoking them.
Let's go Hadi.
[18:22] Farheen, where did you go with Hamza last night?
I told you about that.
[18:31] You only told me that Hamza's car got faulty.
[18:35] But you didn't tell me that you went to a five star hotel with him.
[18:39] But how did you know about that?
Hmm
[18:43] You thought that mom won't know anything. I can go anywhere and will tell a lie to her because she is fool.
[18:53] Tell me, did you go with him or not?
[18:57] Yes mom, I went there.
[18:59] Then why did you lie to me?
I didn't lie, I was with Hamza not with anyone else.
[19:06] Why are you getting so hyper?
Hey you cursed girl, why did you hide this from me?
[19:12] You should have told me. I wouldn't stop you. Thank God that Fabiha told me.
[19:17] I got embarrassed in front of her.
[19:19] I wouldn't have known if she hadn't told me.
Oh I see.
[19:22] So it means that Fabiha has incited you against me.
[19:24] She didn't incite me. Tell me why did you lie to me? What was the reason?
There was no reason. You are stuck with it for no reason.
[19:35] Let me see Fabiha, she is spying on us.
[19:41] She has revealed your lie.
[19:49] Fabiha, I will see you.
[19:51] She should live peacefully in her house. Why is she bothering us?
[19:57] What the hell.
[20:00] She is chasing us.
[20:14] Hamza, if you really want to see me happy and lessen the burden of mom so that she may live peacefully so please accept my condition.
[20:38] Hadi eat it, you won't get sandwich today.
[20:50] Hello, so you have ignited fire in our house.
[20:56] Why did you tell mom that I went to restaurant with Hamza last night?
[20:59] But I didn't know that you didn't inform mom. I thought that she would know about that.
[21:04] If you are living happily in your house then just mind your own business.
[21:11] There is no need to discuss anything about me with mom.
[21:15] Sister I didn't say any such thing that you are so angry.
[21:20] Yes, you are so naive.
[21:26] By the way tell me Fabiha, if you saw me with Hamza then couldn't you keep that secret.
[21:35] Or did you feel bad by seeing me with Hamza.
[21:40] Why would I feel jealous? You can roam around with anyone.
[21:43] Yes that would be better for you to mind your own business.
[21:50] And don't interfere in my matters.
[21:56] Try to take care of what God has gifted you.
[22:03] And no need to look back towards your past.
[22:09] I warn you if you again said anything about me to mom.
[22:14] Whether I roam around with Hamza or someone else it's none of your business. Understand?
[23:08] Did you talk to lawyer?
Yes brother, I have shared all details with him.
[23:15] He is preparing file and as soon as it gets ready he will send a letter to Arham.
[23:25] Listen, I want you to talk to Arham once, I think he would return custody of Hadi to you.
[23:35] If he would do so then he wouldn't have made such fuss.
[23:41] Sanaya is right.
[23:46] When it comes to man's ego then he doesn't listen to anyone.
[23:54] We have to do everything in a legal way.
[24:00] Anyways I don't want to linger on this relation anymore.
[24:08] Once I get the custody of Hadi
[24:12] Then I will end this relation as well.
[24:22] But have you thought that how will you bring up your children alone?
[24:28] I have realized this by living with Arham for so many years that how can I live without a man.
[24:40] I can bring up my children in a much better way without Arham
[24:50] But I can't get humiliated anymore by living with him.
[24:59] Listen, you should keep in mind that we are with you in whatever decision you will make.
[25:10] But I would say that make this decision very thoughtfully.
[25:18] This life and all it's moments are very precious.
[25:26] When we are not afraid of losing such precious things then we become more strong.
[25:39] And you sister is very strong.
[25:43] Indeed.
[26:21] I am in my senses.
[26:24] I have no objection in getting married to you.
[26:31] Rather, I have brought you here that I wanted to tell you that I want to marry you.
[27:21] Farheen, why are you calling me again and again?
[27:25] You minded my words so much that now you are feeling bad of receiving my calls.
[27:33] I am sure that you aren't liking me right now.
[27:36] Listen, I have to go for an important work so I will talk to you later. Bye.
Hello.
[27:41] You can't disconnect without answering my question. I want you to answer my question.
[27:47] Which answer?
[27:49] Answer of that question which I asked last night.
[27:54] Farheen, I have already replied.
[27:58] Didn't you think once again since last night.
[28:02] No.
Hamza.
[28:05] Swear on the name of your mom that you didn't think once about me.
[28:13] Hamza, if you really want to see me happy and lessen the burden of mom so that she may live peacefully so please accept my condition.
[28:34] Hello.
What did you say to Hamza?
[28:43] Tell me.
[28:53] Farheen. Farheen
[29:01] I am asking something. What did you say to Hamza?
[29:04] Nothing mom.
[29:06] Don't try to fool me.
[29:09] Tell me what did you say to him? Why is he angry?
Mom I told you that there is nothing.
[29:16] You are stuck with it.
[29:18] I will tell you if there will be something. There is nothing like that.
[29:21] There must be something.
[29:23] Tell me otherwise I will bring Hamza in front of you. Tell me what's the matter?
[29:29] Mom, I am unable to understand that why do you force me so much?
[29:37] You were never so stern with Fabiha but now you are afraid from my side.
Because I know you very well.
[29:46] Don't make mistake by considering me as deaf and dumb. Understand?
[29:50] Don't pay attention on my words. I have gone mad because I am not getting married.
Whether you have gone mad or not but you are definitely fooling me.
[30:01] OK, I will ask from Hamza.
Stop, do you want to know? So listen.
[30:14] I want to marry Hamza.
[30:19] I have started to like him and I told him about it.
Shameless girl.
[30:28] My one daughter has humiliated me already but you haven't left anything as well. Oh God what should I do?
[30:33] But mom what's wrong in it? You also want me to get married.
[30:40] So why can't I chose a guy of my choice?
[30:42] Have you seen the difference between your age with Hamza?
[30:45] That difference doesn't matter mom. Will you refuse even if Hamza gets convinced?
[30:53] Mom, you like Hamza then what's the problem? Can't you support me a bit?
Oh God what should I do to you Farheen?
[31:00] Mom please agree with me, why are you increasing my problems?
[31:05] Leave me, get away. I don't know what happened to you.
[31:10] If Hamza had any objection on this proposal then he would have refused straight away but he didn't do anything like that.
[31:18] I think that he is thinking about this proposal as well.
[31:21] Mom, will you refuse even if Hamza gets convinced?
[31:31] Why do I suffer all the time? Please don't refuse, I will take care of the rest.
[32:35] So now you analyze my words as right and wrong.
[32:37] If I want to give you love and become your life partner to share your sorrows then what's wrong with that?
[33:14] Didn't you think once since last night? Swear on your mother's name that you didn't think about me once since last night.
[36:21] Hello sister.
Hello
[36:26] Just do I am asking you to do.
[36:31] Now pick up your bag.
[36:36] I picked up.
Now take all books out of the bag.
[36:53] I did that.
OK, now put your clothes in it. Only two suits.
[37:09] I did it.
Done.
[37:12] We will meet in school tomorrow.
But where will we go?
[37:19] I don't know.
[37:21] Make sure no one should be aware of our plans.
[37:25] We will meet in school tomorrow.
[37:28] Keep your bag safe.
[37:31] Don't show this to aunt Fabiha.
[37:33] OK? OK sister.
Done, good.
[39:15] What are you doing here Hadi?
Dad, I am unable to sleep. Can I sleep with you?
[39:21] Yes you can sleep here.
[39:24] Fabiha give her some space.
[39:27] Come here.
