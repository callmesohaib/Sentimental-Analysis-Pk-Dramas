[02:51] I was about to divorce Sanaya 
[02:55] and during that her mother got a heart attack
[03:02] her mother died because of me, Fabiha
[03:09] I took way everything from Sanaya
[03:15] I did such a grave mistake 
[03:19] I don't understand anything Fabiha..
[03:22] that how shall I gather everything?
[03:28] Sanaya... kids
 I have ruined everyone's life
[03:37] what's wrong with you Arham, gather yourself I am with you
[03:41]  Sanaya needs me Fabiha
[03:48] I should be with her
[03:59] if Sanaya's sympathy remains in his heart in the same manner, then one day she will be present in this house
[04:04] you need to do something before that, Fabiha
[04:18] you will be saved from a woman's curse, Fabiha 
[04:22] but how will you be saved from a mother's curse?
[04:29] And think about those kids whose father has left them.
[04:40] dear look, a loan is returned
[04:48] and Arham is a loan for you from Sanaya 
[04:52] always remember that
[05:01] what's wrong Fabiha? Why are you taking your mother's words to your heart?
[05:06] My fate is like a shining star, whose brightness can never dim
[05:12] neither I have snatched anything from anyone, nor I will let anyone snatch anything from me
[05:19] I am Arham's wife
[05:20] only I have the right on Arham & his belongings
[05:38] hello!
[05:40] Farooq, the boss is not attending my phone. Just tell him that I won't come to office today
[05:45] I have sent him a voice note already, but do tell him
[05:49] thank you!
[06:00] Hadi
[06:02] Hadi?
[06:04] why are you sleeping here?
[06:06] Fabiha
[06:08] Fabiha
[06:10] what happened?
[06:12] why are you sleeping here in such a hot environment?
[06:15] what happened, Arham?
[06:16] Hadi
[06:17] why Hadi is sleeping here?
[06:20] I had made him sleep upstairs, Hadi what are you doing here?
[06:23] No
[06:24] dear, when Fabiha aunty had made you sleep upstairs then why you came here?
[06:30] I am so hungry, Dad. Fabiha aunty didn't give me anything the entire night
[06:36] Fabiha?
[06:39] come, let me give you breakfast
[06:41] leave it
[06:42] I am giving him the breakfast he is hungry. Go in your room & relax. I will make him do the breakfast
[06:50] don't you understand once? How many times I have told you not to say such things in front of your dad
[06:57] If you do this next time, I will oust you from this house, and I will get your father to beat you
[07:02] you will remember it for life time, come on get up
[07:33] Hamza, shall we go?
[07:38] lets go dear
[08:10] are you going somewhere?
[08:18] yes
[08:22] where are you going?
[08:26] its Sanaya's mother's funeral, so I am going there
[08:33] did you make Hadi do the breakfast?
[08:36] yes, he did it
[08:39] Fabiha, do one thing. Get Hadi ready, he will go with me
[08:43] Okay, but you didn't tell me that you are going
[08:47] so I've told you now
[08:52] please get Hadi ready
[08:54] Arham, do you also think that all of this happened because of me?
[09:02] that your family got ruined because of me?
[09:05] its not like that, Fabiha
[09:07] then why are you so rude with me?
[09:15] why do I feel from your behavior that you also feel that all of this happened because of me
[09:23] why am I seeing myself as a criminal in your eyes?
[09:33] you are thinking wrong, Fabiha
[09:39] neither I have said any such thing to you, nor I am thinking that way
[09:46] I just regret on my mistake
[09:48] and what is that mistake?
[09:59] Say it, what is that mistake? Marrying me!
[10:06] I don't see any other mistake of yours except for this
[10:08] its not like that, Fabiha
[10:10] it is like that, Arham
[10:15] its exactly like that! It wasn't only the fault of the time
[10:21] it was my fault as well that I came into your words
[10:51] Mom, lunch is ready. I have prepared potatoes and bottle gourd vegetables. You like them, right?
[10:57] yes, I do like it a lot
[11:00] I miss Fabiha by seeing this curry, she loves to eat this as well
[11:07] mom, honestly speaking after seeing Fabiha's house I was so amazed
[11:16] All praise to God, she got the luxuries of a princess
[11:20] what's the use of such a government?
[11:25] For which you always stay afraid that it can be snatched away anytime
[11:28] God forbid mom, what are you saying?
[11:34] if there will be any problem in her house, then eventually she will come back here
[11:40] have you forgotten, what a chaos & drama was created in our neighborhood
[11:46] you should pray that she shall always stay blessed in her house
[11:53] as it is, what will happen to me if she comes back
[11:56] what are you blabbering?
[11:58] nothing mom
[12:00] listen! Now don't discuss anything about her house in front of Hamza. There is no need to
[12:06] Why its not needed? Do you know, Hamza is still in Fabiha's grief
[12:14] he should know that now Fabiha is happy & set in her life
[12:18] Farheen, you'll get beatings from me. I told you that there is no need to so keep your mouth shut. Understand?
[12:24] I don't understand what is your problem. You always pressurize me for everything
[12:28] Fabiha has given her so many griefs that I don't want her to get hurt again after listening about her
[12:37] understand?
[12:39] what's the use of me saying anything? You hardly trust me
[12:43] yes! as if you have fulfilled a lot of promises that I shall trust you again
[12:54] She just sits & talks rubbish!
[13:46] how is my daughter?
[13:48] absolutely fine
[13:56] Junaid, at least tolerate me for the kids
[13:59] see...
[14:01] I will never forget that you are the reason of my mother's death
[14:14] and its better for you to leave before creating any drama
[14:20] I will leave in a while
[14:24] I won't tolerate you even for a second
[14:28] neither in this house, nor in my sister's life
[14:45] What kind of relationship are you trying to nurture after mentioning the word 'divorce'?
[14:53] its a funeral house
[14:55] there is no need to argue with him right now, please be careful
[14:58] tell him to leave from here, get lost from here right away
[15:03] uncle
[15:08] please don't oust my dad
[15:16] Sister, please try to make Junaid understand that our relationship is still intact
[15:24] don't stay in this delusion that you have any sort of relation left with this house
[15:32] now I won't let this relation stay intact, understand?
[15:38] I am the wall between you & my sister
[15:45] don't forget that you have not only hurt my sister, but my mother too
[15:53] lets go Junaid
[15:56] leave it, lets go
[15:58] come
[15:59] be careful Junaid
[16:03] why he came here?
[16:18] are you angry with your dad?
[16:23] a little bit
[16:25] I'm sorry dear
[16:27] dad made a mistake
[16:30] its ok dad, everyone makes a mistake
[16:37] I have accepted your sorry
[16:43] now accept mom's sorry as well & take us away from here
[17:03] the child whom you had left like an orphan on the road
[17:07] I ma tolerating you for her
[17:10] I don't have to say it again
[17:12] do leave from here immediately, Ok?
[17:57] mom, mom...
[18:01] with whom you came, Hadi?
[18:03] with dad
let me call Hareem right away
[18:07] mom, were you missing me?
[18:10] dad has brought me so that I can meet you
[18:16] mom always miss you, dear
[18:25] where is Hareem?
[18:27] She is upstairs. Go, go to your sister
[18:59] I'm coming
[19:04] hey Hamza, you are here. Didn't you go to the office?
[19:07] I had gone to the office, but I had an outdoor work today
[19:11] so I thought to come & ask about your well-being
[19:15] my well-being is just an excuse
[19:18] The entire problem lies with your heart, which must have been restless since last night. I know
[19:24] maybe that's why I come to you, Farheen
[19:28] because you understand what's there in my heart without even saying
[19:31] Hamza, say it that you come here to erase Fabiha's memories
[19:39] you are appeasing your heart with me
[19:41] what are you saying?
[19:43] the same that I had felt
[19:45] otherwise tell me, have you ever asked me that how I am?
[19:49] am I happy or not? Why I haven't got married as of yet
[19:52] No..
[19:53] our discussion always starts on Fabiha & ends on her
[19:57] who is very happy in her house
[19:59] Sorry, not a house but she lives in a palace
[20:03] do you know, her kitchen is way too bigger than our entire house
[20:07] big rooms, big terrace, even her store is bigger than my room
[20:13] here we are swerving for love & there she has everything, a bungalow, luxuries etc..
[20:21] also big cars
[20:27] Here, we have each other's faces to see and hear each other's taunts
[20:37] and who told you off?
[20:43] by the way Farheen tell me something honestly
[20:47] why you haven't got married till date?
[20:52] because I didn't find a guy like you
[20:55] yes, true that. You can never get a guy like me
[20:58] I completely trust my fate, understand
[21:01] yes, I also have. And you should be trusting your fate as well
[21:05] And Farheen, I pray that you may get whatever you want
[21:12] and yes, if you ever need any of my help in this matter then I am here
[21:17] say it to me without any hesitation
[21:20] really?
[21:21] don't refuse on the right time
[21:24] I promise you
[21:27] okay
[21:29] Will you make me keep standing here like this? There is no longer any ritual to serve the guest in this house
[21:34] make me a cup of tea
and where is aunty?
[21:36] mom is inside, come let me make some tea
[22:24] do as I am asking you to do, nobody shall get to know anything
[22:30] but what if dad shouts again then?
[22:34] talk slowly
[22:35] nothing will happen, Hadi
[22:38] everything will be fine. Just do as I am asking you to do
[22:42] by the way, what do I have to do?
[23:08] take good care of yourself, Ok?
I will come again, bye!
[23:24] Hadi...
Hadi
[23:48] Sanaya, Sameena aunty is leaving. Meet her
[23:58] yes?
[24:00] sister, where is Hadi?

[26:51] No no... I will tell
[26:55] Hareem, Hadi...

[26:58] what are you guys doing here?
[26:59] nothing! We were just playing hide & seek
[27:01] No, we were playing tap & run
[27:03] hey...
[27:11] mom, come with me
Hareem
[27:12] please get me that Elsa
Hareem, listen to me
[27:15] please come, I want it
[27:17] mom, its there. Give it to me
Hareem!
[27:19] Hareem, listen to me
[27:22] this is not the right time to play with Elsa, do you know how many guests are there downstairs?
[27:26] its just a matter of 5 minutes, please give me
[27:29] No Hareem, you cannot play with Elsa right now. So don't insist
[27:44] where were you? I've been looking for you since so long
[27:47] I was upstairs
[27:48] Why are you barefoot? Where are your slippers?
[27:50] they are inside the room under the bed
[27:52] really? go & wear them then we'll go home
[27:55] You also come along with me
[27:57] No, I won't come. Bring them & wear, then we'll leave
[28:01] Fine, then I will go barefoot
[28:03] Okay, I am coming along
[28:06] how many times I have told you that you should not stay barefoot
[28:25] why aren't you giving it to me?
[28:26] don't insist! dear, don't insist & annoy your mom. Ok? No, you cannot play now
[28:42] now both of you will shake hands with each other
[29:05] Now end this anger
[29:14] dad
[29:17] say sorry to mom
[29:28] say sorry to mom
[29:33] I'm sorry, Sanaya
[29:41] Yaay! mom & dad became friends with each other
yes!
[29:47] mom, will you come with us now?
[29:59] dear, you know
[30:02] Just now, your granny has died
[30:11] and right now, your uncle, Anaya & your aunty needs me a lot
[30:16] You guys can go with your dad; mom will come later
[30:21] but how will I go without you?
[30:23] and yes! dad has already said sorry to you
please mom, lets go
[30:28] I will come later, but not now. Ok?
[30:31] please mom, lets go
we'll go
[30:35] now both of you shall go, come on
[30:42] they are children, Arham
[30:44] don't take their words seriously
[30:52] and don't ever think that I will come along with you
[31:06] Sanaya, I do have an idea of your griefs
[31:13] I know what you had to tolerate
[31:22] but Sanaya, you also know me. I am emotional since always
[31:32] I make decision, whether right or wrong. But I don't realize
[31:37] after a long time I get to know that
[31:40] it was wrong
[31:47] I'm sorry Sanaya, because of me...
I don't need your apologies, Arham
[31:54] We seek forgiveness from the place from which we hope to receive it
[31:58] today on wards, don't keep any sort of hope from this house
[32:07] I don't want you to keep burning in the fire of my hatred always
[32:12] Sanaya, you always used to say that if a person realizes his mistake then
[32:17] A mistake doesn't remain a mistake
[32:19] there is a difference between a mistake & a sin, Arham
[32:22] you did second marriage, it was your mistake
[32:27] but you broke my heart & that's a sin
[32:31] I will not forgive you for the rest of my life because of that
[33:36] hello, greetings mom!
[33:39] Greetings! How are you?
[33:43] do one thing, tell Arham to bring some fruits & juices for you
[33:49] it would be better for you in this condition
[33:55] Fabiha
[33:57] hey, are you listening to what I am saying?
[34:00] yes mom, I am listening
[34:03] where is your attention? Is everything fine?
[34:09] yes, everything is fine
[34:12] ok tell me, what I have said to you?
[34:18] what's the matter, are you worried?
[34:23] Mom, Arham has been with Sanaya for so long. I have been waiting for him for a long time
[34:31] I am so restless that I can't tell you. She got a chance to spend time with Arham under the excuse of her mother's death
[34:37] he is with her since then
[34:40] hey! since when your thinking has become so negative?
[34:47] Sanaya is also her wife, she also have some right on Arham
[34:51] no right is left anymore mom, he has divorced her
[34:54] only one is left & soon it will be done
[34:56] what!
[34:58] that's what I am afraid of mom. If the relation would have ended completely then I would have been at peace too
[35:06] If she comes back for real, it would be a big issue for me, Mom
[35:11] what shall I say to you, dear?
[35:16] Fabiha
[35:21] hello! Hello?
[35:29] what is this problem!
[35:41] what happened, all good?
[35:43] yes, I was just waiting for you
[35:50] what happened?
[35:51] are you ok? Sit here. Would you like to drink water?
[35:55] Hadi, go bring water
[35:58] I was feeling a bit dizzy
[36:01] one second, drink some water. Hadi, bring water
[36:05] here, drink some water
[36:15] is it better?
[36:17] I am fine
[36:17] Sure? Else lets go to the doctor
[36:19] No no, I am fine
[36:21] with whom you were talking on the phone?
[36:23] I was talking to my mother
[36:26] I wasn't feeling well, and there was nobody at home, so I thought to talk to her
[36:30] I didn't find appropriate to disturb you
[36:33] come, lets go in the room
[36:38] come Hadi
[37:16] compose yourself Sanaya
[37:24] Sanaya
[37:31] compose yourself Sanaya
[37:38] After a lot had happened
[37:42] Arham wants to just apologize and...
[37:46] wants me to forget everything
[37:51] as if I don't have a heart in my chest
[37:53] he is a man
[37:56] a man never values a woman's emotions
[38:00] and he cannot control his emotions
[38:10] why a woman has to tolerate everything?
[38:18] all mistakes
[38:21] why a woman is always at fault?
[38:30] why a man forgets that
[38:33] The woman whom he is bringing into his life is also a woman
[38:45] in our society
[38:49] there are two point of views of a man
[38:56] he finds his mother, sister & daughter
[39:00] always right
[39:07] if he finds someone wrong, then its a wife
[39:19] if you keep agreeing with your mother-in-law & sister-in-law then everything goes fine
[39:28] I agreed with them, I also did the same, but what did I get?
[39:38] Disloyalty
[39:40] Loneliness...
[39:49] mom...
[39:56] mom
[40:10] oh my mother
[40:16] how will I live without my mother
[40:22] how will I live without my mother
[40:28] show some courage Sanaya, please
[40:38] mom...
