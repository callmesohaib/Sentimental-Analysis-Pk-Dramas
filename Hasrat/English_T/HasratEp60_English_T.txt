[00:00] come back to your senses, Sanaya!
[01:31] then divorce me!
[01:33] I, in my complete senses...
Arham. Arham!
[01:36] mom...
[01:54] mom, mom... 
[01:56] yes my dear
[01:58] mom, shall we play football today?
[02:00] mom had some work, but its okay
[02:04] but first mom will play football with you. Lets go!
[02:08] lets go, hurry up
[02:12] be careful, you'll hurt yourself if you fall
[02:14] lets go, you guys so I am coming in a while. Come on, go now
[02:21] you must be very happy, right?
[02:26] You've made me look like the bad person in Arham's eyes by involving your kids.
[02:30] do you realize about my pain now?
[02:37] I haven't fought any battle against you, still you've lost
[02:45] this is the truth of my relation
[02:51] Besides, the matters we leave to God, we shouldn't worry about.
[02:58] and what you had said?
[03:01] One should not trust time; it belongs to no one. If it's with me today, then tomorrow it will be with you.
[03:07] right?
[03:09] you are saying right
[03:11] time doesn't supports anyone
[03:16] But remember one thing, I have never thought anything bad for your kids.
[03:23] But you have made this baby an orphan before his birth, and you will be held accountable for it.
[03:33] what do they say? A child, like a blessing, makes a husband and wife's relationship stronger.
[03:44] now I will also use my baby
[03:52] the battle of wives will be continued
[03:55] Now let's get a father's battle done.
[04:01] lets see, which child is more dear to him
[04:50] The way stagnant water cannot be used, Arham.
[04:54] the same way
[04:56] a buried person or relation, can never come back
[05:19] I supported you.
[05:22] So that you may feel honored
[05:25] But now I am realizing that I did so wrong with my children and with myself.
[05:30] You ruined every relation just to get my trust.
[05:40] But the biggest relation was of humanity.
[05:43] But you didn't take care of that
[05:49] I am regretting. I am regretting round the clock that I left my wife
[05:54]  and now I am in this condition
[05:56] But I can't leave my children.
[05:58]  I love my children. 
[06:01] And what about this baby?
[06:03] Fabiha go to your mother's house until this baby is born.
[06:12]  Fabiha, it's my baby.
So he will stay with me.
[06:16] And what about me? 
[06:17] Where will I live? 
[06:19] Fabiha
[06:22] it would be better if this matter may not get worse
[06:25] So it would be better for you that you shouldn't be sitting here when I will come back.
[06:31] Go to your mother's house.
[07:17] your henna's color is so dark
[07:20] by the way, what do they say if one's henna color comes so dark?
[07:24] the groom loves his wife a lot
[07:27] really? So Hamza also loves me?
[07:32] the color of your henna is telling the same thing
[07:47] Okay
[07:49] What happened? She hasn't gotten ready yet.
[08:03] Fabiha... you!
[08:06] didn't you go to Dubai?
[08:09] No mom
[08:11] everything is ruined
[08:16] Arham has sent me back to my house
[08:20] why?
[08:22] I don't know, its just because of Sanaya
[08:26] Okay
[08:29] Okay aunty, I am leaving. I will come with the groom's family now
[08:34] baraat?
[08:37] mom, how am I looking?
[08:39] Fabiha
[08:41] sister, are you getting married?
[08:46] and you guys didn't even tell me
[08:52] but you had gone to Dubai, right?
[08:55] leave that matter, but.. 
[09:08] Hamza's bride
[09:11] what is all this, mom?
[09:15] Fabiha, actually we were about to tell you
[09:24] It means my eyes saw the right thing. Yet, you scolded me so much.
[09:29] and mom you! What not I did for the happiness of you guys
[09:33] And you had forgotten your own daughter.
[09:39] Mom was scared, what if you minded it.
[09:43] Was she scared that I would mind it, or was she scared that her secret would be exposed?
[09:50] Look, you've moved on in your life
[09:56] Now, whoever Hamza marries, it shouldn't affect you.
[10:01] Sister, no matter whom Hamza would have married, it wouldn't have affected me as much as my own sister!
[10:07] Fabiha
[10:09] Whatever grudge you have, express it now.
[10:11] if you will utter rubbish in front of Hamza, then nobody will be as bad as me
[10:14] Yes, yes, now you'll paint me as the bad person, because I've added poison to the color of your life.
[10:19] anyways, leave this topic & participate in your sister's wedding happily
[10:24] let me tell you one thing, all of this is happening as per my consent & with everyone's happiness
[10:29] even Hamza's?
[10:31] yes Fabiha
[10:32] Hamza has accepted me from the bottom of his heart
[10:38] Now I don't understand why you're arguing so much. Did we interfere in your happiness?
[10:48] please come
[10:58] Greetings aunty!
Greetings, stay blessed
[11:02] come in dear
[11:05] You were not so happy at the time of my engagement with Hamza.
[11:18] and you!
[11:22] you were so upset upon my disloyalty
[11:27] why are you quiet now? Answer me!
[11:38] mom
[11:41] take Fabiha inside, she is crossing her limits
[11:45] lets go dear, come inside
[12:13] Hadi... Hadi

[12:18] now its my turn
[12:19] its Hareem's turn Hadi, no cheating

[13:17] you shall try now
[13:19] Okay, lets go
[13:21] come on, go to your mom
[13:23] come here
[13:51] nothing, I was looking at the kids. Its ok
[13:54] I am sorry
you guys carry on
[13:56] I am really sorry, I hope its not hurting a lot
[13:58] its alright
[14:00] you continue playing with the kids
[14:04] I am coming
[14:08] what happened!
[14:10] sorry
[14:12] dad got hurt, he won't play now
[14:16] mom didn't hurt him intentionally, Ok?
[14:18] Come on, lets play
[15:42] there is no need to take Fabiha's words to your heart
[15:46] you know, she is like that since always
[15:49] she cannot tolerate anyone in front of her
[15:53] Today is your wedding, brother. No matter who was in your life, who came, who left, it shouldn't affect it at all.
[16:00] in fact, one thing should effect that who is entering your life
[16:10] none of your actions shall tell sister Farheen that she is not that dear to you
[16:18] Fabiha shouldn't be here
[16:20] brother, she will be everywhere as she is Farheen's sister
[16:27] in fact, your mind shouldn't go there where Fabiha is
[16:34] this is the truth, the way you had accepted your mother's death
[16:37] the same way, also believe that Fabiha is buried now
[16:46] I am fine, Hania
[16:48] anyone's presence or absence doesn't affect me anymore
[16:52] Great!
[17:02] Have you ever seen a person mourning about someone else on their own joyous occasion?
[17:08] what does it mean?
[17:11] I mean, my brother your face is telling everyone that I have brought the groom forcefully
[17:20] there is no need to be so clever
[17:23] go, check if the bride is ready
[17:27] hmm... just keep your mood as it is. Rest I will handle
[17:33] now go
[18:41] I had told you not to say anything in front of Hamza
[18:44] Then why did you say it?
[18:46] What's wrong with you, Mom? Even I have heard so much scolding from people; I was taunted too.
[18:51] It was also important to tell him that all of his claims about his love for me were false.
[18:55] he wasn't a liar
[18:56] but you were.
you were a liar!
[19:03] I feel ashamed
[19:04] but what to do, this is the truth
[19:10] You kept using his love while considering it as someone else's treasure.
[19:15] And at the eleventh hour, you left him.
[19:19] why are you feeling bad now? What is it, tell me
[19:23] That he is getting married, or he is not in your fate anymore.
[19:28] Fabiha look, whatever you did
[19:32] Whatever humiliation you gave me was enough. Please don't insult me further.
[19:37] you took your life's related decisions yourself
[19:40] Whether good or bad, your mother didn't have any role in it.
[19:43] look at this
[19:45] I beg you, if you say so then let me keep my honor in your feet.
What are you doing?
[19:50] but, don't take my trial anymore
[19:54] please let Farheen get married
[19:59] See, she attained this happiness with a lot of difficulty and luck
[20:04] please don't take them away from her
[20:08] go, wed off your daughter
[20:12] your this daughter won't say anything
[20:56] Hadi... Hareem, quickly come on the dining. The dinner is ready
[21:01] Mom, what have you made for dinner today?
[21:04] today, your mother has made your favorite dinner. Burger & Fries!
[21:08] Burger fries, yes!
[21:11] mom, where is my ketchup?
[21:12] oh sorry! let me bring it right away
[21:15] Yum yum...
[21:22] here is your ketchup
[21:24] hmm... yummy

[21:37] yes! and that too of drawing & after that vacations... yes!
[21:42] mom, where will you take us?
[21:44] hmm.. I will take you guys wherever you'll ask me to
[21:49] hmmm... ok, first day we'll go to the play land

[21:58] hmm...

[22:04] okay
[22:05] fourth day we'll go to the park
[22:09] Okay... these are so many places but your mom will take you. Don't worry
[22:14] now finish it quickly. Quickly eat your dinner
[22:22] at least try, how is the burger
[22:28] how's it?
[22:29] very yummy!
[22:31] thank you! now finish it, ok?
[22:34] okay
hmm...
[23:14] Come on, dinner is over. Quickly go, brush your teeth, and straight to bed.
[23:19] No, we'll play with the puzzles
[23:21] No, absolutely not. You won't play the puzzles as we have an exam tomorrow. Now hurry up!
[23:25] come on, hurry up
Ok
[23:26] mom..
yes
[23:27] yes?
tomorrow is our last exam
[23:29] yes baby, now hurry up & go to sleep
[26:10] don't worry, I am not here to taunt you
[26:15] I came to participate in your happiness
[26:23] its a human nature, sister..
[26:26] When he sees his pride with someone else, jealousy is created automatically.
[26:37] Your fate is trying to offer you happiness again and again with open arms, but you are running after someone else.
[26:43] But very few fortunate people are like you, who seize their happiness at the first opportunity by reaching out their hand.
[26:53] and on the other side, the people are like me
[26:56] Those who always keep pushing and shoving
[26:59] Fabiha, you should be very happy
[27:04] that you got a life partner like Arham. He has got everything
[27:07] but he doesn't have a heart, sister
[27:09] and what shall I do of such a man who doesn't have a heart
[27:16] his heart only beats for Sanaya
[27:18] and I have realized it quite late
[27:23] So, will you never go back there again?
[27:27] Sister, this is not the right time for such questions. Right now, it's time to celebrate your happiness.
[27:32] if you say so, shall I take you upstairs?
[27:37] lets go
[28:27] Hamza
[28:31] I have handover the piece of my heart to you
[28:36] take very good care of her
[28:43] don't you worry
[28:46] Farheen is my responsibility now
[28:51] and I know how to fulfill my responsibility, I promise you!
[28:59] I know
[29:01] I trust you more than myself
[29:04] stay happy & blessed
[29:13] Okay enough now, aunty we shall leave now. Please allow us to leave
[29:16] we'll take good care of sister Farheen more than you, happy now?
[29:19] If God wills
[29:20] shall we go, brother?
[29:53] lets go
[30:18] yes Hadia?
[30:19] yes brother, how are you?
Have the kids recovered from the trauma?
[30:25] Sanaya has handled them as she always does.
[30:29] sister Sanaya? Is she with you?
[30:35] she is nearby but not together
[30:39] I'm amazed, despite everything that happened, your wife is still there.
[30:50] only a mother can give such a big sacrifice
[30:59] brother...
[31:00] I think it should be enough for you that your wife has not turned away from her responsibilities.
[31:07] Hadia, how shall I fulfill my rights now?
[31:10] what is already done, whatever the time has passed
[31:16] after that, its difficult to rectify anything
[31:23] but I think we should not loose hope
[31:26] nothing is impossible, brother
[31:30] and how it will happen?
[31:31] For now, let your wife get used to seeing you daily.
[31:39] right now her biggest trial is that you are in front of her eyes
[31:48] Let she have patience once
[31:50] I think only then something can happen
[31:55] what if it didn't happen then?
[32:00] then...
[32:03] then we have to see
[32:06] That's how much a man can sacrifice for his family and children.
[32:16] The way a woman can sacrifice for her children and tolerate so much.
[32:23] Can a man also do the same?
[32:31] by the way brother, shall I ask you something?
[32:36] won't you get tired of convincing her?
[35:04] I will take 20,000 rupees, neither one rupee extra or less
[35:08] Hey, no cheating
[35:10] Brother, why are you being so miserly? Sister is getting tired because of you sitting inside.
[35:14] sister, its not getting late because of me. Its all my brother's fault
[35:18] Hamza, its just a matter of 20,000 rupees
[35:21] they aren't precious than your sister, so give it to her
[35:23] Wow, have you also become her supporter now?
[35:26] and you won't be getting any 20,000 rupees
[35:30] take this
[35:33] here...
[35:36] these are 500 rupees, they are enough for you
[35:38] No no, give me some more.
Ok fine, take these. Now its 2000, I won't give you more
[35:42] nothing will happen with this
[35:43] really? then give them back to me
[35:45] ok fine, you'll remember that you've got such a good sister
[35:48] By the way, do I have to return the 10,000 rupees that I found in your pants this morning?
[35:53] where is that amount?
[35:54] now the camel has come under the mountain! I won't give them back to you
[35:58] Okay, keep them as well
[36:02] now go
[36:12] you guys fight too much
[36:14] the fight starts every morning & by the night
[36:18] sometimes it gets over
[36:20] really?
[36:22] Who will you fight with once Hania goes to her house after her marriage?
[36:28] with you, who else?
[36:29] Don't you dare! If you fight with me, I'll get upset and go to my mom's house.
[36:34] then you have to come to convince me
[36:36] really! And you think that I will let you go?
[36:42] close your eyes
[36:46] do it
[36:57] open them now
[37:00] this is for you
[37:02] they are so beautiful!
[37:05] Help me put them on, since you've gifted them to me.
[37:08] Sure
[37:20] they are so nice
[37:22] Hamza, do you know. I can't believe that we are married
[37:28] mom was right
[37:31] I have achieved this happiness by luck.
[37:33] And now, I want to keep these happiness very safely.
[37:38] but I would be needing your help in it
[37:41] I want the assurance of my happiness from you, Hamza
[37:47] the happiness we get by luck
[37:50] They never stray from their path, Farheen
[37:56] and what you've got
[37:58] it was yours, that's why you got it
[38:01] and its never ending
[38:03] Hamza
[38:05] promise me that you'll always be there with me for a lifetime
[38:09] and you will never let anyone come in between us
[38:13] I will always be with you
[38:16] Since I have made a promise, I will fulfill it until my last breath.
[38:21] Besides, my heart is not that big for many girls to live in it.
[38:30] I didn't had an idea that you are so funny
[38:34] you have never explored this side of mine, you've always been fighting with me
[38:38] okay sorry
[38:40] today on wards, no more fights
[38:44] only love?
[38:48] you'll get bored
[38:50] No, absolutely no!
[38:57] its so pretty
