[01:00] Hello mom. 
 Hello. You're back soon?
[01:04] Mom, you do know, I have an alternate on Friday.
[01:18] I met Hamza today.
[01:35] He looked angry. He didn't even talk to me properly.
[01:41] When a man hates the woman he loved,
[01:47] then he hates everything associated with it.
[01:53] Do you know, he has sold his house?
[02:00] When I talked about a loan in office, I found out.
[02:07] Oh well. His case is finished. He was so worried.
[02:13] Hmm. Thank God.
[02:18] Mom.. I told him about Fabiha as well. But he didn't ask anything.
[02:29] How she is? Where she is or if we tried to find her.. nothing at all.
[02:38] She's alive. Not dead.
[02:50] Why are you saying that? Did you talk to Fabiha?
[02:57] She called. 
 So where is she? Did you ask her?
[03:04] Why should I ask?
[03:10] She can go to hell as far as I care.
[03:15] What are you saying mom? She might be in a problem? 
 She is in no problem. She sounded fine.
[03:26] And even if she's in a problem, its created by her own self.
[04:18] Hmm.. whats happening? 
 I'm making meatballs for the evening.
[04:27] Meatballs? You're working very hard.
[04:37] My brother likes meatballs a lot.
[04:45] He requested me to make them.
[04:53] What have you put in them? 
 Salt, turmeric, yogurt.. all these things.
[05:04] Did you forget to put chillies? 
 I did..
[05:10] Its alright. I'll help you.
[05:18] What did you do?
[05:22] What did I do?
[05:27] I helped you.
[05:36] Are these too much?
[05:41] Oh.. You'll have to do all the hard work again.
[05:51] I'm sorry.
[05:58] So sad..
[07:02] May I come in? 
 Why are you here?
[07:13] I asked why are you here? Are you here to see what spectacle I've become? 
 I'm here to return the money I borrowed from the company.
[07:26] I'm here to tell you that those who commit fraud, they run away. They don't stick to their facts.
[07:39] Some people sell their conscience. Thank God I'm not one of those. My conscience is alive.
[07:57] Sanaya mam.. its the way of the world. Only the innocent get punished.
[08:12] You and I are travelers of the same boat.
[08:21] As soon as she got married, you got a cheque worth millions. Weird, isn't it?
[08:34] What do you mean? 
 You're reacting as if you don't know.
[08:45] What do I not know? 
 Don't tell me you don't know Fabiha has married Arham?!
[08:54] What?! This..
[09:19] What are you saying, mam? 
 The same you heard.
[09:28] Get out.
[09:37] I didn't know. I didn't.. 
 I made a mistake trusting you and hiring Fabiha.
[09:49] Its because of you that my life is destroyed. Remember this..
[09:57] You wouldn't ever settle down too, Hamza.
[10:12] Get lost from here.
[10:21] I... 
 Get out..
[11:39] Don't tell me you didn't know Fabiha married Arham?!
[11:48] I made a mistake, I trusted you and hired Fabiha. My life was destroyed because of you, Hamaza. Remember this. Even you will never be happy.
[12:02] Yes I have an affair with him. I love him. I don't want to live with you. I can never feel the same for you Hamza.
[12:10] What will I do living with you? What will you give me? Poverty? Hunger? 
[12:20] I have freed myself from this relationship long ago and it would be best if Hamza did the same.
[12:44] Move out of my way. 
 Oh you want something?
[12:49] We're hungry. We want a sandwich.
[12:52] Just this? I'll get it ready in five minutes. 
 I'm telling you to move out of my way.
[12:58] Move!
[13:08] How can I not go inside? I'll see!
[14:43] I want to slap you so hard that this world can hear me.
[14:49] But my love and my honor doesn't allow me to.
[14:54] I wasn't stupid. I was blinded by your love, Fabiha.
[15:06] I want to burn your world. You have made me fall down so low in my eyes.
[15:15] But my love and my honor does not allow me for this.
[15:21] I haven't been brought up this way.
[15:27] I wasn't disloyal to you. I never claimed to love you.
[15:33] You drowned with your own perspective. And what do you think? You'll barge into this house?
[15:40] And I'll tolerate everything? You'll raise your hand on me?
[15:51] I'm not scared of you. Do you understand?
[15:54] If after today, you even dared to come in this house, you'll see the worst of me. Get lost..
[17:26] Mom, this is the limit. Its not acceptable at all. Now will this girl's lover visit our house?
[17:35] How will it affect our daughters? My daughter is here as well, under Fabiha's influence.
[17:45] Mom.. you'll have to talk to Arham. If you don't talk to him, I'll do it myself.
[18:02] What happened Hadia? Whats happening?
[18:11] I'll talk to Arham.
[18:14] My child...
[18:19] Mom.. I'm worried about Hareem. Look at how scared she is.
[18:30] How will she be brought up? 
 Sanaya should have thought about it.
[18:41] She has sent the kid here and forgot about everything.
[18:46] Mom.. Hareem is our blood. Our child. What will happen if we leave her on Fabiha?
[18:57] What will she become when she grow up? Bold, brazen?
[19:12] Let Arham come back. I'll talk to him.
[19:23] I will do it.
[19:27] Let your father come. We'll talk to him.
[20:34] I don't want to create a scene in the office. Its best if you leave. 
 I'll not leave without talking to you.
[21:05] There's nothing to talk about but if you want any more sacrifices out of me, I'm sorry.
[21:17] I will not sacrifice anymore. 
 I and the kids cannot live without you. Stop being stubborn.
[21:23] Stubborn? Stubborn?
[21:29] And then I should share my husband happily? 
 Sanaya I want to see you with me and I know you cannot live without me.
[21:40] Don't punish yourself.
[21:45] Keep yourself in my place just once.
[21:51] If you had been there in my place and it was about a girl's respect?
 You gambled my entire life to save her respect.
[22:02] You were a man, you had rights.
[22:09] You could have done anything just not be disloyal.
[22:25] A person only does something if he wants to. 
 Sanaya, everything can be forgotten.
[22:37] Change your decision for the sake of our children. 
 Do you want to hear the truth?
[22:46] The truth is I don't want to bring up my children in a home where their father is divided between two women.
[22:56] It will be better if I keep fighting for my right. The effect the tussle of our egos will have on our kids,
[23:08] it is better that I leave you.
[23:27] This is my final decision.
[23:39] I don't want to snatch Hareem from you so it would be best if you can give her to me without any fight.
[23:50] You're her father. You can be trusted to be a good father.
[24:03] But Fabiha is her step mother. I don't even want her shadow to fall on my kids.
[24:15] Don't do this. 
 You should have thought about it earlier.
[24:26] You can leave now, Arham.
[26:55] What happened? Did you talk to Sanaya? How is she? 
 I couldn't talk to her at night.
[27:01] But when I went to her room in the morning, she wasn't there. Maybe she went to drop Hadi to school and then office.
[27:10] Isn't she back from work yet? 
 No.
[27:14] Junaid, its best for her to spend more time in the office.
[27:19] Because if she stays here, she'll keep thinking about everything.
[27:24] We can only offer support but only she knows what she's going through.
[27:30] But we cannot ignore all this. Its important to talk to Sanaya for all this.
[27:38] Junaid, I think we should give her time. All this isn't easy for her.
[27:50] You're right. We should wait for her. Lets see what she decides.
[28:01] I have decided brother. 
 What have you decided?
[28:13] I want a divorce from Arham.
[28:30] What are you saying, Sanaya?
[28:39] I've decided.
[28:54] Mom.. please calm yourself down. Come here. Mom.. Look after her.
[28:59] Mom, sit down. Do you want water? 
 No.. Sanaya...
[29:14] Arham, what is it? What happened?
[29:24] Sanaya has decided to leave me.
[29:36] Relationships don't end so easily. Don't worry. She's saying this because she's emotional. Its not possible for her as well.
[29:46] Fabiha.. I know Sanaya.. when she decides something,
[29:53] she stands by it and now she has decided.
[30:06] Fabiha, I cannot live without my kids.
[30:13] And not even without Sanaya..
[30:27] Where is Hareem?
[30:30] Have you seen what she did? She should have told her lover that she was married so he wouldn't have barged into our house.
[30:43] Did you see Hareem's condition?
[30:48] Hamza came here? 
 Yes. He barged in and claimed to love her in front of the children.
[31:01] Think about it.. is this how things work in our house?
[31:07] Why didn't you tell me earlier?
[31:09] You know how Hamza turns mad? 
 He goes crazy? This is the first mad man..
[31:14] How do we know how many such crazy men will come to our house? 
 Hadia!
[31:23] What Hadia? You leave your daughter with a woman whose not with one man herself. 
 Enough! Quiet.
[31:33] Not a word more. I'll forget that you're my sister.
[31:40] I am not such a girl, Hadia.
[31:46] Should I tell everyone what sort of a girl you are?
[31:53] You left your fiance and married a father with two children..
[32:03] You ridiculed your mother's respect.. 
 We're a respectable family. Will you keep her in this house?
[32:15] What respect will we have in the family? Don't you know what we call such girls... 
 Hadia!
[32:29] Enough! Enough!
[32:40] What have you turned me into?!
[32:46] First she was bad and now she is bad too..
[32:54] If she had been here, she'd have been bad. My luck is bad.
[33:03] You'll get my dead body in this house one day.
[33:09] Then you'll be happy.
[33:22] I keep fighting everybody outside and come home for peace.
[33:32] And this is what I get? You come here and feed her nonsense. My house is in this state because of you Hadia.
[33:44] I love my children. I'm not an animal. I know they're my kids.
[33:57] I didn't do this knowingly. It just happened.
[34:14] Forgive me. I've had enough.
[34:20] Please. I don't want anything.
[34:49] Brother..
[34:58] Mom.. Mom?
[35:04] Brother? Brother? Mom...
[35:09] Mom.. 
 What happened to mom? Fabiha, call the ambulance. Mom..
[35:16] What happened to mom? 
 What happened to her?
[35:23] Mom? Mom? 
 Hadia, keep mom upright.
[35:45] Divorce? This isn't the right decision. Sanaya is wrong, Junaid.
[35:51] What are you saying? Whether her decision is right or wrong, she has the right to decide for her life.
[36:00] We cannot force her to live with Arham. 
 This means, you'll not make your sister understand? If she walks the wrong path,
[36:08] would you not explain her or bring her to the right path? 
 Mom is right Junaid.
[36:14] You should talk to Sanaya. Maybe she'll listen to you.
[36:20] I know mom is right but this is our point of view. Sanaya has her own perspective.
[36:25] She is thinking about herself and her kids. Who are we to stop her? 
 Whatever she's thinking is wrong.
[36:35] We cannot live our lives without our men. She can live without her husband but a father will never live without his kids.
[36:43] A mother will never live without her kids and the kids will be divided between the tussle these two have.
[36:50] Mom.. my dear mom.. try and understand me. She has decided. Its useless arguing with her now.
[37:01] I think we shouldn't bother Sanaya. 
 Can I see my daughter destroying herself?
[37:08] Can you not make her understand? At least tell her to give it some time. Haste makes bad decisions, Junaid.
[37:17] Mom is right.. 
 What should I tell her Soumya? What should I say? Can I promise her that I'll throw Fabiha out of Arham's life?
[37:26] What are you saying? Mom, please control yourself.
[37:32] I'm telling you that we shouldn't worry.
[37:36] Whatever Sanaya has decided, let her. Trust God. Why should we worry about something that hasn't happened?
[37:44] Do you know that she does what she says and she'll keep on doing what she said?
[37:54] Mom, please calm down. You'll get sick. 
 You get water for mom.
[38:00] I'll get water.. 
 I don't want water.
[38:06] Don't worry. How can I tell you? 
 Oh my God..
[38:41] Mom?
[38:49] Mom? 
 Not now Soumya. Leave me alone.
[38:55] Mom.. please be strong. 
 I cannot, Soumya.
[39:04] Sanaya's decision has made me restless.
[39:10] I'm thinking I should meet her myself and make her understand to change her decision.
[39:18] Junaid has raised his hands from the matter.
[39:23] I'm her mother. I cannot see my daughter being destroyed. I'll try my best to make her understand.
[39:31] Maybe she'll understand. 
 Alright. Don't get worried sick.
