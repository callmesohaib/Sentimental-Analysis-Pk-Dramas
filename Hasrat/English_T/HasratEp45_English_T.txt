[01:16] Today is the last day of school. Revise well for your exams. Whatever your teacher explains you,
[01:23] mom will you ask about it. 
 Okay mom. 
[01:25] Good boy. Hareem you too.
[01:32] Come on now. 
 Mom, how have you made me wear this?
[01:35] Sorry.. now hurry up. The van is about to come.
[02:10] Go and change. I'll make the juice. 
 You'll do it?
[02:15] You took care of me all night and did me a favor. I can at least try and pay you back with this small thing.
[02:29] Sanaya, whatever I did wasn't a favor. Its my duty. 
 All your duties seem like a loan to me now, Arham.
[02:46] How will we spend our life like this Sanaya?
[02:54] Life goes by..
[03:01] Living is difficult, Arham.
[03:45] So what do we have for breakfast? Hello mom. How are you? 
 Hello.
[03:54] Mom? 
 What is it mom? You seem worried. Is everything okay?
[04:04] Tell me the truth. What are you hiding from me? 
 What will we hide mom?
[04:11] I heard the two of you last night.
[04:20] Thats why tell me the truth, Soumya.
[04:35] I don't have it in my fate to see my daughter happy,
[04:39] but don't hide her pain from me. Tell me what happened?
[04:59] Mom.. actually, Arham was in the hospital with Fabiha, yesterday.
[05:17] And Fabiha is expecting.
[05:48] What? You hid such a big thing from me?
[05:53] Mom.. we didn't want to give you any tensions thats why we didn't tell you.
[06:03] My daughter must be crying tears of blood and you're worried about my happiness?
[06:16] Mom, this had to happen. 
 Does Sanaya know about it?
[06:26] I didn't talk to Sanaya about it. 
 She didn't even mention this to me either.
[06:34] Mom, let it be. Don't worry. God will make everything alright. Please have this juice. 
[06:44] Junaid see.. go and bring Sanaya and her kids here for a few days.
[06:58] I know how difficult this time is for her.
[07:04] Bring them here tomorrow. 
 Okay, I'll bring them tomorrow. We'll do as you say.
[07:18] Now please have your breakfast. Do you want some bread? 
 I'll take it dear. I'm feeling very anxious.
[07:33] Wow.. you had your husband for one night and you've changed. As if you have all the rights.
[07:42] I don't run after things that are snatched from me.
[07:52] Its good. You shouldn't even run. 
 Drink your juice or it'll get warm. 
[08:02] Thank you. 
 And yes..
[08:08] Be careful. Its not your husband but his first wife who made this juice for you.
[08:14] I've lost everything. Be careful.. you don't want to lose everything too.
[08:43] What nonsense is this? What did you mix in this? 
 I didn't mix anything. I was trying to scare you and you got scared.
[09:02] How did the glass fall down? 
 Arham, she told me she mixed something in the juice.
[09:14] And you threw the glass?
[09:21] Its okay Arham. This happens with women in this condition. 
 I'm fine Arham. I'm not lying. She told me she mixed something in the juice.
[09:35] I'll order something for you. Please don't clear it. I'll get it cleared.
[09:43] Sanaya thinks, she'll do all this to drive Arham away from me. I'll clear her misunderstanding now.
[10:04] Hello. 
 Hello. You're back soon.
[10:07] Yes. I wasn't feeling well. 
 Why have you started feeling unwell lately?
[10:13] Mom please.. don't act like my mother in law now. 
 What?
[10:18] Where is Hamza? 
 He hasn't forgotten Fabiha yet.
[10:25] If you can, please rid him of it. 
 Tell me clearly.
[10:38] I don't know what Fabiha has that Hamza cannot see in me. Maybe he ignores me deliberately.
[10:44] Why don't you tell me what it is? I don't understand whatever you're doing.
[10:49] Did you have a fight with Hamza? 
 Oh mom.. its work stress. What should I tell you?
[10:54] You have started taking this work stress right now. There was nothing earlier.
[10:59] I have a headache right now. Please don't start with your questions now.
[11:07] What? 
[11:09] Whats wrong? Why are you so restless? 
 I'll be restless if I see you worried.
[11:16] And if there are so many problems in your office, quit it. Find another place.
[11:22] I'll leave it when I find a good job. 
 I think you've gone mad.
[11:28] And the way you misbehave with me, I am the only one who tolerates it. Nobody else will.
[11:54] I shouldn't have talked to Hamza like this. He must be so angry. What will he think about me? I don't understand what to do.
[12:15] Good to see you around. 
 Same here. Rahat Group of Companies haven't sent a confirmation email.
[12:22] You're very lucky. Your job is saved. The CEO of Shah Group of Companies was here. He wants to open his account worth millions here.
[12:35] He praised you so much in front of the boss. Now you know.. 
 My promotion will be finalized.
[12:42] Of course, my dear. 
 Sorry. Just pray my friend.
[12:51] Abdullah told me your father has married twice. Do you have two moms?
[12:55] No. My father didn't marry anyone. Abdullah is lying. 
 Abdullah is making fun of your father with his friends.
[13:01] I will not spare Abdullah. I'll go teach him a lesson. Abdullah!
[13:31] What did you say? 
 Hadi is here..
[13:35] Which mother dropped you today? Your own mother or your step mother? 
 I'll tell you which mother I came with.
[14:23] Hello Farheen. How are you? 
 Hello. I'm absolutely fine. 
[14:28] How come you called me today? 
 I hadn't talked to you since so many days so I thought  I'd called you.
[14:38] So Hania.. is Hamza alright? 
 Brother? Didn't you meet him? Didn't you not go to work?
[14:50] No. Is he back home? 
 What happened Farheen? Its 1pm in the afternoon. He wouldn't come at this hour.
[15:09] Oh.. he's home.
[15:16] Farheen has called. She wants to talk to you.
[15:40] Farheen? I think Hamza is tired. He didn't even listen to me and went inside.
[15:51] Maybe something happened.
[15:57] You wait. I'll try and find out and I'll tell you if I find out. Okay?
[16:04] Alright. Bye. 
 Okay. 
[16:34] So many missed calls from Hadi's school? Hello? Hello?
[16:52] What? What are you saying? Okay. I'm coming. 
[17:19] Arham, Hadi's school called. Hadi threw a stone at Mrs. Hassan's son. Her son is bleeding. I'm going to the school. Please come fast.
[17:46] Hadi.. what did you do dear? 
 Abdullah said that my dad had married twice.
[17:53] So? Would you do this?
Hadi.. what did you do dear? 
 Abdullah said that my dad had married twice.
[17:53] So? Would you do this?
[18:00] Hadi.. what did you do? Mom told you not to. 
 Abdullah was saying bad things about my dad..
[18:10] The kids around the school are discussing Mr. Arham's second marriage.
[18:18] This had to happen. When Hadi was made fun of, he threw a rock at Abdullah's head and split it open.
[18:24] Mam, this is our personal matter. If the children discuss their home matters in the school, I think its a teacher's duty to discipline them.
[18:32] Mr. Arham, if this was your personal matter you should have told your children at home, not to spoil the discipline here.
[18:45] Hadi's actions are intolerable. I will only allow him for his exams now.
[18:53] You can find him a new school when the new session starts.
[19:02] Mam, how can you do this? This cannot happen. Where will my son go?
[19:09] Her son threw a rock at Abdullah today. God knows what he'll do tomorrow.
[19:18] I cannot take any risk for my son. Either Hadi will stay in this school..
[19:26] Or, my Fatima, Narmeen and Abdullah will not study here.
[19:33] No. Mrs. Hassan, don't worry. Its Hadi's fault. I cannot destroy the future of three kids for him.
[19:43] Sorry Mrs. Sanaya. I cannot allow your son.
[19:57] Its about Hadi's future. You cannot do this to my son. Please mam. 
[20:02] See, Mrs. Sanaya, if I allow your son, tomorrow some other parents will stand in your place.
[20:10] This has never happened in our school before so I cannot allow your children.
[20:18] See, there is a procedure within a school. If there is a complain, you cannot expel him straightforwardly.
[20:25] There is a warning. There must be a warning.  
 Sir, I had already warned Mrs. Sanaya.
[20:33] That your children were very depressed. Please you need to focus on them.
[20:41] Sanaya.. you didn't tell me. 
 See, if Mrs. Hassan accepts your apology. We'll reconsider the admission.
[23:13] Brother...
[23:21] What happened? 
 Farheen called. She wants to discuss something important. 
[23:27] I don't want to talk to anyone right now.
[23:38] Brother, whats wrong? She wants to discuss the guests. 
 I told you I don't want to talk to anyone. 
[23:47] Whats wrong brother? 
 Do you have anything else to discuss with me other than Farheen?
[24:00] Now tell me what happened? Why are you so pissed off? 
 Hania, I have a lot of work related stress. Please go.
[24:10] Right now I think its more about Farheen than your office.
[24:14] I'm telling you to go. 
 No. I won't. First tell me what happened? 
[24:18] I'm telling you to leave, leave! Why don't you understand once?!
[24:33] Go!
[25:00] Hania...
[25:37] Who fights in the school, Hadi?
[25:41] Why did you hit Abdullah?
[25:49] Do you know, dad was so embarrassed in front of your principal because of you?
[25:58] Dad, everybody was laughing at me and saying that my dad has married twice.
[26:08] And I have two moms.
[26:42] If the principal had warned you, you could have told me Sanaya. 
 When did you have the time?
[26:51] Sanaya.. you forget things. Don't make it my fault.
[26:59] Please, accept that its your fault.
[27:11] Don't scream, Arham.
[27:24] And if you had worried about what I wanted, the structure of this house would have been different. As far as telling you is concerned, I did come to you.
[27:36] But you were so busy in your so called life that you didn't worry about the children.
[27:50] Are the kids only mine?
[27:53] Is it my responsible to report about the kids? 
 Don't talk about responsibilities, Sanaya!
[27:57] Why shouldn't I talk about rights? You have my rights to someone else and wronged me and my children!
[28:18] Whatever Hadi's condition is today, its only because of you Arham.
[28:22] Sanaya, this isn't because of my wrong decision but because of your irresponsibility!
[28:33] Really? If you think that is so, you take the responsibility of the kids, then.
[28:45] You think if I cannot handle the responsibility of my own kids, then go ahead and you do it.
[28:52] This is easier said than done, Arham.
[29:03] Really? This means, I cannot fulfill the responsibility of my own kids?
[29:21] Sanaya.. you cannot accuse me for Hadi's mistake.
[29:27] You are responsible as well.
[29:33] And what do you think? Apologizing would fix everything? You and I will have to apologize to Mrs. Hassan and then his admission will be reconsidered.
[29:52] Now why are you looking at me?
[29:54] Arham, stop it. Why are you fighting in front of the kid? 
 I'm warning you. Stay out of it.
[30:04] I was just.. 
 I told you..
[30:08] Stay away from me and my kids. 
 Sanaya!
[30:13] She is as much a part of this family as you are.
[30:19] You cannot insult her in front of me.. Remember this.
[30:34] She can be a part of your life but not this house because there are other people here, Arham.
[30:42] And I will not even let her shadow fall on my kids.
[31:34] Mom...
[31:46] Did Hamza call, mom?
[31:50] No. What happened?
[31:53] He was telling me that some people wanted to come see Hania.
[31:59] But he didn't know how to handle everything so he wanted us to be there.
[32:06] This is a great news. When did they call us? 
 Tonight.
[32:15] He said the boy was well settled.
[32:20] He has his own house and business.
[32:25] He said that the boy must keep Hania happy.
[32:33] Its good. Hania will get married. May God bless her with a good life.
[32:43] Hamza's friend, who is always with him. He's his cousin.
[32:49] Alright. I pray to God for Hania's good fortune.
[32:56] May she live happily in her house.
[33:02] Both my daughters had an ill fate.
[33:19] We'll leave at 6pm.
[33:24] You get ready. I'll call a cab.
[33:29] Alright.
[33:56] It seems you have been scolded a lot by your father.
[34:05] Will you not talk to me too? I was thinking to make a sandwich. Do you want one? 
 No.
[34:12] Oh.. so much anger?
[34:17] See your dad is right. You shouldn't fight in your school.
[34:23] If you want, I'll make your dad talk to you. 
 Really?
[34:27] Of course. He'll agree if I tell him.
[34:33] What is all this Sanaya? You said everything was alright? Arham was fine with you. Everything was okay.
[34:41] What is all this?
[34:46] He was screaming at you.
[34:59] Hadi threw a stone at a child in the school and its my fault.
[35:05] He has been expelled from his school and this is my fault too.
[35:10] I thought about the kids' future and its my fault too, mom. 
[35:14] If you are scolded like me, then? 
 Then both of us will be upset with dad and hide in the garden and he'll come find us.
[35:24] But then you'll have to be okay. You'll have to be friends with dad. Done? 
 Done.
[35:30] Now stop being upset. Lets go. 
 Alright.
[35:36] Come..
[35:38] But whats wrong is wrong, dear.
[35:44] Hadi shouldn't have done it. What happened?
[35:53] Hadi's parents are wrong, mom. Hadi isn't.
[36:00] But Arham won't understand this. Maybe nobody will.
[36:09] You tell me.. even if dad isn't alive today, if someone says something to him, how will we tolerate it?
[36:22] Who will hear bad for their father, dear? 
 How could Hadi, then, mom?
[36:31] If the kids will say something bad about his dad in the school, how will he tolerate?
[36:35] If you tell us something as your family, only then we'll know.
[36:52] You told me to settle down.
[36:59] And if I have to settle down, I shouldn't complain, mom.
[37:06] I have to forget everything and move on and I'm trying that.
[37:10] I told you to settle down, dear. But this doesn't mean you'll not share your pain with your mother.
[37:21] And you start hiding things from your mother.
[37:29] What did I hide from you? 
 Things you should've told me yourself, Sanaya. I'm finding out from Soumya.
[37:41] Why have you started hiding everything from your mother?
[37:50] I accept that you have a lot of courage and you want to tolerate everything yourself without sharing your pain with your mother.
[38:01] But dear, sharing pain makes it less but if you tolerate it all alone, you'll become helpless.
[38:12] Why be helpless mom? I have to be happy for my kids.
[38:18] I had heard from my mother that nobody has courage like a mother.
[38:26] But I've seen it in my daughter's face today.
[38:36] You have compromised with your fate.. Just pray that your kids do it too.
[38:48] What is it about kids mom? They will forget everything in one night.
