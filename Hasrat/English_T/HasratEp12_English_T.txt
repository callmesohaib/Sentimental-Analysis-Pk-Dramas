[00:53] Shaheen, why are you so tensed that you've become bedridden?
[00:58] I just keep thinking that both my daughters will go far away from me.
[01:04] I just keep thinking that both my daughters will go far away from me.
[01:10] This is how the world is. Every parent has to send off their daughters one day.
[01:18] Which parents will want to keep their daughters at home? If you allow today, we'll take Fabiha with us.
[01:32] You took my words. Lets just decide a date.
[01:38] How can we just finalize a day? I mean, I'm your only son, mom..
[01:47] And yours as well. And both of you will have to wear a saree on our wedding.
[01:53] How can you wear a saree in this condition? And this is why until you're alright and the doctor gives you a health certificate,
[02:01] I will not get married until then.
[02:03] But dear... 
 No ifs and buts. No questions. I've told you.
[02:11] And our happiness isn't more than your health.
[02:16] Your son is very hardworking and capable.
[02:24] He never hurts anyone. But seriously, he knows how to sweet talk.
[02:34] Fabiha, dear, go and get some tea dear. 
 Yes mom..
[03:01] My child.. my dear.. 
 Oh my God..
[03:04] My dear looks so cute. 
 Hello.
[03:10] How are you? 
 Thank you.
[03:13] Hello aunty. 
 Hello. May you live long.
[03:16] How are you? 
 I'm fine. You?
[03:19] Come on in, Arham. 
[03:21] Be careful..
[03:27] How are you? 
 I'm absolutely fine. You tell me.
[03:30] What can I say.. Usually such things,
[03:34] are said during weddings or funerals.
[03:40] But its not the two. No wedding, no funeral. Its a happy occasion.
[03:48] We should forget all complaints on such happy occasions. 
 What are you saying?
[03:54] We have no complaints for you in our heart. As it is, you've realized, its enough for us.
[04:01] No. I have a complaint.
[04:06] What complaint do you have? 
 Ever since you got married to Sanaya..
[04:11] You have taken away all our rights on her. She's encumbered by the house chores all day.
[04:18] She has forgotten her own family.
[04:22] Its not the brother's and sister in law's responsibility to do all the servicing.
[04:26] No. Its not that. Arham always keep on telling me.
[04:31] I cannot make time. 
 How will you make time? The time you have left is spend with your husband and kids.
[04:39] I'd tell you take care of yourself. Have you looked at yourself? You've become so weak.
[04:45] I'd say, health is wealth. 
 What are you talking about?
[04:51] Leave all this. I think we should get dinner now. 
 Thats a good decision.
[04:59] I'm very hungry. 
 So hows your job coming along?
[05:03] Its coming along fine.
[05:10] So, what was Sanaya telling you alone in the room?
[05:16] Why? Were you spying on us?
[05:21] Don't change the topic. Tell me what was she saying?
[05:26] Nothing. She just wanted a loan. 
 How much?
[05:33] Around half a million. 
 Half a million? Oh..
[05:41] Thats why Arham brought his wife and children here.
[05:47] What do you mean? 
 I mean, he wants something. Thats why he came here.
[05:55] I'm noting. You're turning against Arham very much. 
 I gave him a lot of respect, Junaid.
[06:03] But he lost his respect himself. 
 Soumya..
[06:08] Please, its done. He has apologized to us.
[06:15] He was in need so indeed he would apologize.
[06:20] And Arham did that too. You would have said yes immediately for the money.
[06:27] What could I do? Should I have said no to my sister and broken her heart?
[06:32] So listen to me now. You'll not give any money this time.
[06:53] Junaid can never say no to me. He'll transfer the money in a day or two.
[07:01] So should I say no to the loan in the office? 
 Yes. You should.
[07:08] What happened? You seem tired. 
 I was busy with mom all day.
[07:15] Then the dinner. I'm tired now.
[07:24] Then come here.. 
 Arham, what are you doing?
[07:27] I'll give you a head massage today. 
 You'll do it?
[07:32] Take the opportunity. 
 Of course. I'm lucky to get it. Go ahead.
[07:41] Oh wow.. May you live long.
[07:52] I'll explain a few things. See, all the spices are here.
[07:56] The tea and sugar is here. Mom's porridge is here too.
[08:01] The plates are here. And everything else.. milk, chicken and vegetables,
[08:07] in the fridge. Mom's insulin as well.
[08:12] No matter how much mom insists, don't give her anything to eat without the insulin.
[08:16] Alright? 
 Okay.
[08:18] Go out from here, straight from the left is mom's room. Okay? I've kept her clothes there. I'm getting late for work.
[08:24] And I haven't given her breakfast. You'll give it to her. Alright?
[09:02] Aunty, what are you doing?
[09:07] Sit straight or else you'll fall down. You want water? Here..
[09:13] Who are you? What are you doing here? 
 I'm your caretaker and my name is Fabiha.
[09:21] And from now, if you need anything, you should tell me. 
[09:25] I've made you breakfast but before that we'll take insulin. 
 Oh...
[09:32] Arham? 
 Nobody is home aunty. Everybody has gone to their office. I'm here for you.
[09:38] Alright. So a maid will give me breakfast now?
[09:46] I don't want breakfast. Leave my house.
[09:51] What did you do aunty?
[09:59] Go away from here.. 
 Listen to me. Lets have breakfast first and then I'll leave.
[10:05] Can't you hear me? Leave.
[11:18] Mam? 
 Im in a meeting. Thank you. Send Haris to me.
[11:29] Hello? 
 Sanaya did you call at home?
[11:31] No. I'll call now. I was in a meeting. 
 Alright. You do that.
[11:37] And talk to Junaid as well. Bye. 
 Okay.
[11:53] Mom? Mom? I want to talk to you right now.
[12:00] What happened? Why are you so angry? What is it? 
 Mom...
[12:05] Once the daughters are married, she shouldn't have any concerns about what her sister in law wears, eat or how much money her husband haves.
[12:14] Dear, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Tell me directly. 
 Mom, I don't understand what Sanaya wants from us.
[12:22] Her kids stay here.. I have no problem with that. But I'll not tolerate that Junaid is worried because of Sanaya.
[12:32] I don't know what Sanaya and Junaid talked about. How can I say anything? 
 I'll tell you..
[12:40] Sanaya has asked Junaid for half a million yesterday. And Junaid doesn't have extra money to spend on Sanaya.
[12:50] Maybe Sanaya needs the money. She'll only ask Junaid. She has never asked before.
[12:56] Mom.. you're being told for the first time because Junaid doesn't like things between him and Sanaya to reach you.
[13:05] Thats why I'm always quiet. Mom, but Junaid also has responsibilities. He has a wife and a daughter.
[13:12] We have your responsibility and we've never turned down our responsibility.
[13:17] Sanaya is taking advantage of his simplicity and I'll not tolerate this at all. 
 Don't worry dear, I'll talk to Sanaya.
[13:25] Whatever it is, I'll explain him myself. 
 Alright.
[13:31] It would be best that you explain her. 
 Okay.
[13:43] Listen? 
 Yes?
[13:45] Drop the kids to their house.
[13:48] Mam told me to drop them here. 
 And what am I telling you?
[13:52] Auntie, this cannot be. 
 Sit inside. Sit!
[13:58] And get off at your house next time. And call their mother and tell her.
[14:03] Why are you sending Hareem to her house? 
 You go inside.
[14:07] Aunty, mom will not be at home. We'll be alone.
[14:15] Come and sit dear.
[14:35] You're back again. You're very stubborn. 
 Aunty, its important to give you insulin.
[14:45] Where is the insulin aunty? I kept it here.
[14:49] How would I know where it is?
[14:54] Please tell me where is the insulin? I left it here.
[15:00] Aunty please tell me where did you keep the insulin?
[15:04] Aunty please.. if Sanaya mam finds out, she'll throw me out. I've got this one job after a lot of difficulty. Where is it?
[15:10] I don't know. I told you.
[15:14] Aunty please tell me where did you keep the insulin. If Sanaya mam finds out, she'll...
[15:22] Please tell me where did you keep it..
[15:24] I'm the sole breadwinner of my house. I need to get my mom's medicines. There is so much to do. Where is the insulin? Please tell me.
[15:30] Why? Don't you have a brother or a father?
[15:35] Those who have brothers and fathers, their daughters live peacefully. They don't struggle like me.
[15:40] Please tell me where did you keep the insulin? I cannot jeopardize this job.
[15:50] Please tell me where did you keep the insulin? Please.
[16:00] Grandma, I'm here. 
 Oh my dear..
[16:05] Where are Hadi and Hareem? I can't see them.
[16:09] Yes mom, I sent them home with the driver. 
 What? You sent them home?
[16:15] But there will be nobody at home at this time. Nor Arham, nor Sanaya.
[16:19] Mom she should realize that all responsibilities don't fall to her family.
[16:24] Her children are being looked after here and so Sanaya thinks we'll support her financially as well.
[16:29] She should realize that she's married now. 
 Soumya, you did wrong.
[16:37] I'm alive to take decisions right now. 
 Aunty, I've done good to Sanaya for long. Not anymore.
[16:46] They say the children are staying at their grandma's but it falls down to her daughter in law to change and feed them.
[16:54] And now I won't take any responsibility of Sanaya's children on my head, mom.
[17:00] Come Inaya.. 
 Oh...
[17:22] Yes? 
 I called to ask about mom. How is she? Did you give her insulin? Did she eat?
[17:30] Yes. I did. It was a little difficult but I handled it.
[17:35] Alright. I'll be back by 6.30. Handle things until then. 
 Yes. Alright.
[17:43] Hello? Come here..
[17:47] Whats your name? 
 Hadi..
[17:50] Oh wow. Its a beautiful name. And you?
[17:53] Why should I tell you my name?
[17:56] Hmm.. it seems someone was scolded at school. 
 No..
[18:00] Our aunt threw us out.. 
 Hadi!
[18:04] Didn't mom tell you to not tell family things to strangers?
[18:09] Come from here now!
[18:19] Mom.. I've brought you lunch.
[18:25] I don't want to eat what you cooked. Take it away. Fabiha will come and give me food.
[18:30] Mom, Fabiha only knows how to earn money. She doesn't know house chores. Now stop being stubborn and eat.
[18:43] Whats wrong mom? If you don't eat, how will I give you medicine?
[18:47] What do you care if I die? As it is, you've killed me.
[18:54] Your stubborn attitude forced me to be selfish.
[18:59] Rather than accepting your mistake, you're being persistent, Farheen. 
 What mistake, mom?
[19:05] I had a right to the jewelry alongside Fabiha. 
 So you could have asked me for them? Why steal?
[19:10] I did ask you. But what did I get in return? Lectures about being patient and advises to leave Haris.
[19:16] You have nothing else to give me. Mom..
[19:22] I made my fortune myself otherwise you had not left anything in it for me.
[19:26] Don't let your tongue and character lead you astray that nobody supports you in your bad times.
[19:32] Bad times are now gone, mom. My good time will start now and the bad shall not return, if God wills.
[19:41] You must have talked to Haris.
[19:47] Yes. I did.
[19:49] Now if he calls you, ask him to take you away in a month.
[20:42] Here's a yummy sandwich. Here..
[20:47] I don't want bread and butter. 
 Hadi, nothing is cooked. Please eat. Mom isn't home.
[20:54] Alright fine. You want milk? 
 I don't want bread or..
[21:00] this milk.. 
 Hadi, eat. We don't have anything to eat.
[21:24] Why are you upset? 
 I'm hungry and I don't want to eat bread and butter.
[21:30] Alright. So Hadi's hungry. What will you eat? Fries?
[21:36] Do you know how to make them? 
 Of course I do. Come. I'll show you.
[21:45] Hareem, aunty is making fries for us.
[21:49] You can eat. I don't want to eat.
[21:57] You sit here. I'll make fries for you. Hareem will come too.
[22:24] Hello mom. I was about to call you. Are the children home?
[22:29] First leave all this and tell me, did you ask Junaid for money? 
 What happened mom?
[22:35] Answer me first, Sanaya.
[22:39] Did Soumaya say something? 
 Listen to me carefully. Call Junaid and tell him you don't need the money.
[22:47] Tell me something first. And if tell Junaid I don't need them, what will I tell Arham?
[22:51] I've told Arham that Junaid will give me the money. 
 Do as I say, Sanaya.
[22:57] I don't want my daughter to be the reason of this negative atmosphere in my house.
[23:02] And don't worry about Arham, I won't let you be embarrassed in front of him.
[23:06] I'll give you money from my deposit. As much as you need.
[23:12] Don't take anything from Junaid. Understand? 
 This means, its Soumaya.
[23:17] She has created a ruckus at home. And do you know?
[23:22] She didn't even ask me and sent the children back home. Its the limit. 
 What?
[23:30] Why did you have to vent out on the kids? Had I known she would create such a scene, I wouldn't have asked Junaid for the money.
[23:36] I'll talk to you later. Bye.
[24:00] Hello? 
 Fabiha, are the kids home?
[24:03] Yes they are. 
 Okay. I'm coming home. 
[24:06] You don't have to come. Its alright. I'll look after them.
[24:11] Are you sure? 
 Don't worry. They're my responsibility until you come back.
[24:18] Okay. Thank you. 
 You're welcome.
[24:49] Alright? 
 Fine. Give me the keys to the bike.
[25:03] Alright. I've seen the quotation from Affan Industries. Do one thing and recheck.
[25:08] Alright. Sort out the problems and tell me. One minute. Hello? 
 Sir, I'm calling from the bank.
[25:14] This is a reminder call.
 One second. I'll see you at the board.
[25:22] Yes tell me. 
 You'll have to clear your payment by this month's end.
[25:26] I know. I'll do it. 
 Sir, the reason to remind you is that there will be a penalty if the payment isn't cleared.
[25:31] And the penalty is.. 
 I'm an accounts person. I know everything. Don't call again. I'll clear it.
[25:42] Yes. Hello. What happened? All fine?
[25:48] You don't want the money? The reason?
[25:55] Did Soumya say something? 
 Why would she something?
[25:59] Arham has arranged from somewhere else. Don't worry. I don't need them. 
 See..
[26:05] I know you're hiding something from me. You don't need to be scared.
[26:09] Nobody has the right to interfere in siblings matter. No matter if its Soumya. Understand?
[26:16] Now tell me, what is it? 
 Its nothing. Please don't worry.
[26:22] I am worried because Soumya had an argument with me regarding the money and now you're saying no.
[26:28] This cannot be a coincidence. 
 Whatever it is brother, you're not discussing this with Soumya.
[26:35] She will think I complained about her, without any reason. 
 Alright.
[26:40] I can clearly feel that Soumya's resentment has reached you. Thats why you're saying no to the money.
[26:49] Its nothing like that. If I really need the money, I'll call you again.
[26:57] Okay?
[27:25] What happened Sanaya? Did Junaid transfer the money?
[27:30] The bank is calling again and again.
[27:37] Are you alright? 7.. 3.. very good.
[27:42] What comes next? 8.. very good.
[27:48] Where are Hareem and Hadi, Soumya? 
 Mom sent them back as soon as they came.
[27:54] What? What is Inaya saying?
[28:01] I'm talking to you Soumya. 
 So I sent them home. So?
[28:07] Aren't you ashamed? You sent those little kids back home, alone?
[28:13] Their parents aren't home. Do you even care what they would have eaten?
[28:21] And as it is, mom is still here. How come you're taking decisions in her place?
[28:27] I am a member of this family, Junaid. I have a will. 
 So exercise that will on me!
[28:32] Why do you have a problem with my mother and sister? 
 Had I been able to exercise my will on you, there would be no problem.
[28:39] Until it was responsibility, it was alright. But now its finances. I'm not tolerating it.
[28:49] The child is here. Lower your volume. Sanaya didn't tell me anything but your tone has cleared everything.
[28:57] Sanaya didn't tell you anything but the mother and daughter have turned the husband against his wife.
[29:04] Soumya..
[29:08] I didn't expect this of you. 
 The sister is lovesick for her husband and the brother is worried for his sister.
[29:57] Oh God.. walking is hell!
[30:02] It would be nightfall by I reach Fabiha. I'll have to make some arrangements.
[30:22] Hello? 
 Have you vented out with your poison? Turned Junaid against me by filling his ears?
[30:30] If you don't get the money, will you set your brother and sister in law's life on fire?
[30:34] You are mistaken. I didn't say anything to Junaid.
[30:39] Yes, he had a revelation and thats why he argued with me as soon as he got back from work.
[30:45] Soumya, I just said no to the money. 
 You became great by saying no to taking money.
[30:52] And I'm the bad guy. 
 Trust me, I didn't say anything to Junaid. I didn't even talk to Arham.
[31:00] See Sanaya, listen to me carefully. If you want to keep seeing your family forever,
[31:08] then be careful that your problems with your inlaws don't reach me and Junaid.
[31:15] You couldn't make a place for yourself in your in laws. Now you'll lose your own family. You're sensible..
[31:21] You can think good and bad for yourself.
[31:29] Listen to me, Soumya..
[31:40] Hadi? Hareem? 
 Arham...
[31:43] Hello aunty.. 
 Hello.
[31:46] I was here to pick up the kids.
[31:48] Arham.. actually the kids.. 
 They have gone back home, Arham.
[31:53] What do you mean? They're home? How could they go alone? 
 Yes.
[31:57] Because it is important to make you realize that you cannot expect your wife's family to do everything.
[32:03] Soumya.. 
 What Soumya, Junaid? I'm right.
[32:07] He should know that he's the son in law of the family, not a son.
[32:12] And a son's responsibility should be fulfilled by his own mother, not his mother in law or her family.
[32:17] If you say another word, it'll be worse. Be quiet.
[32:22] Alright, you don't care about the son in law but the kids are innocent.
[32:30] And you.. you're their grandmother, you could have stopped them.
[32:34] Arham, I'm embarrassed.. 
 I am the one whose embarrassed in front of my own kids.
[32:40] I didn't expect this of you, aunty. Soumya, I..
[32:46] grateful to you for reminding me of my responsibilities. I'll remember them from now..
[32:53] Bye. 
 Arham.. Arham.. Listen to me.
[32:58] Arham..
[33:03] Why did you have to say this nonsense?
[33:12] So what should we make fly now? Hmm...
[33:16] Hadi.. 
 Alright, lets fly Hadi..
[33:23] Okay, come on.. 
 The piegons fly.
[33:26] Next.. 
 The crow flies.
[33:29] Hareem? 
 You want to make Hareem fly?
[33:33] Dear, you can play too. Alright, so whats next?
[33:38] Eagles? 
 But we just did that..
[33:41] Sanaya?
[33:43] Dad.. Dad's here.. Dad!
[33:48] Are you alright? 
 Dad, aunt threw us out and didn't even give us lunch.
[33:53] Dad but Fabiha aunty gave us yummy fries to eat..
[34:00] Thank you. Did you eat anything?
[34:04] Hareem didn't eat anything. And she misbehaved with Fabiha aunty as well. 
Hareem?
[34:10] Bad manners dear.. Say sorry. 
 No its okay. She's a kid.
[34:15] I don't want to talk to her. 
 Bad manners. Say sorry to aunty.
[34:19] I'm sorry. 
 Its okay.
[34:24] I'm sorry on her behalf. She doesn't bond with anyone fast. I'm really sorry.
[34:30] Its alright. The kids were upset so I..
[34:47] We honored Soumaya and this is how she pays us back!
[34:52] She insulted my son in law and threw him out. I've always taken Soumya as Sanaya.
[35:00] Not a daughter in law but a daughter and its the limit!
[35:05] She insulted me in front of my daughter's in laws. 
 Mom..
[35:12] Whatever Sanaya's in laws did with Soumya in the past, she hasn't been able to forgo it.
[35:17] Soumya hasn't even tolerated a pinch of what my daughter is going through with her in laws.
[35:22] Daughter in laws have to drink patience to live with thier in laws. You don't get respect if you ask for it.
[35:29] You have to win it with your attitude. If I don't say anything to her, it doesn't mean there's no elder in the house.
[35:36] Mom.. please don't worry. Relax. I'll talk to her. Okay? 
 Explain it to her.
[35:43] Otherwise, it won't take time for her to become my daughter in law!
[35:47] I'm telling you. Don't worry. You get ill if you worry. I'll talk to her. 
 Junaid..
[35:56] I'm just worried about Sanaya.
[36:01] If she is in pain, only her mother feels her pain.
[36:07] Only her mother.. you cannot understand that..
[36:13] Make her understand.. 
 Relax mom.. please.
[36:19] You trusted your family very much. They couldn't keep the kids for a few days. You got me insulted.
[36:26] We asked for money but this didn't mean they'd call off their relationship.
[36:32] Please, lower your volume. The kids are sitting. 
 She threw these kids out. They came home all alone.
[36:42] I'll talk to Junaid. 
 What will you talk? Will you apologize?
[36:48] Or else you'll ask me to apologize. 
 No Arham. I don't want that. I'll not say that.
[36:54] In fact, I'll tell Junaid how upset I am. 
 If they cared about you being upset, this wouldn't happen.
[37:00] Do you understand? I didn't expect anything from your sister in law but your mother.. she's their grandmother.
[37:07] She could think.. They're just kids..
[37:10] Mom didn't know.. 
 I'm warning you. Don't advocate for your mother today.
[37:16] You're mistaken. Mom didn't know. 
 Am I mistaken?
[37:20] Am I wrong today? I was insulted because of the one wrong decision you took!
[37:25] And you're saying I'm wrong? Mom was right. I'd realize the day they'll throw my kids out.
[37:32] And this happened today. Remember this, these kids will not go there again, after today, Sanaya!
[37:39] Its enough. And if you be stubborn, I'll stop you from going there as well. Give the kids dinner and put them to sleep.
