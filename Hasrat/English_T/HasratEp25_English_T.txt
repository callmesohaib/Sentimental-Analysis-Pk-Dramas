[00:13] Mom, you can't take Fabiha lightly.
[00:16] Don't trust her blindly. 
[00:19] She is independent and she can take your son with her.
[00:22] No
[00:24] I am a seasoned player.
[00:27] I am very experienced and I have made this decision based on my life long experience.
[00:33] Why are you getting scared after seeing me.
[00:37] You stayed away from me for two days and now you are telling me that I am scared.
[00:43] You can't even have any idea that what is going on in my mind.
[00:49] What are you talking about? What do you mean?
With whom were you last night?
[01:02] I want to ask the same question.
[01:04] If you have told her the truth today then why did you tell a lie that day
[01:07] That wouldn't have benefited.
[01:10] The same thing would have happened which happened today.
[01:13] I heard your discussion with her.
[01:16] And a person only lies when he is culprit.
[01:22] And as long as I know, your relation with Mam Sanaya is not that week which can broken by a slight misconception.
[01:28] Yes, it is not that week which can break easily.
[01:33] She is a woman and she can doubt anyone.
[01:37] Today she has doubted you, she will doubt on me one day.
[01:44] Don't worry, that won't happen.
[01:49] And if something like that happens then trust me you won't be accused.
[01:55] I am not afraid if anything like that happens.
[01:59] But why aren't you afraid?
[02:02] Because I am sure that you won't allow any one to defame me.
[02:08] And you won't leave me alone in any trouble.
[02:12] And why are you so sure?
[02:17] Just like you didn't have any reason to tell a lie that night in the same way I have no reason for my trust.
[02:26] Fabiha, if you don't want to come with Hamza tomorrow then I will pick you. No issues.
[02:32] Tomorrow is my off day.
[02:35] Oh sorry, I forgot.
[02:52] Greetings mom.
[03:00] What happened?
[03:02] Aren't you lying so much?
[03:06] What are you saying mom? When did I lie?
[03:09] Don't pretend to be innocent. You know it very well, what I am talking about.
[03:15] Mom, I really don't know that what are you talking about.
I considered Farheen as a liar till date.
[03:20] But I was wrong and I forgot that you are her sibling and you are also a liar.
[03:26] What happened mom?
[03:29] When your sir Arham didn't go to Islamabad
[03:32] Then why did you lie to me?
[03:34] And his mother also lied to me even though she is so sick.
[03:37] Why? Tell me why?
[03:41] I am asking you? Tell me why?
[03:45] Why aren't you saying anything? Tell me.
[03:48] Tell me
[03:50] I am sure that Hamza would have said something to you.
[03:54] Don't divert the topic, just answer my question.
[03:59] Mom, whoever has given you this information, this is incomplete information.
[04:04] Sir Arham and Mam Sanaya are back.
[04:07] If sir Arham was with her mom then I wouldn't stayed there
[04:11] But you have decided to believe whatever Hamza will say to you and you don't care about my words.
[04:16] OK, I accept your excuse.
[04:18] But tell me about the reason of conflict between you and Hamza. Why are you disliking him?
[04:24] It's a torment to live happily in this house.
[04:28] If you will search for happiness outside your house then you will be punished.
[04:32] Mom you should understand that I am an employee / slave.
[04:36] And slaves don't have their own will.
[04:39] And does Mr. Hamza has the right to take me whenever he wants to.
[04:44] And how much more I will have to get embarrassed because of Hamza? Do you know, how much I got embarrassed in front of them?
[04:50] What would they be thinking about our family?
[04:53] There is no respect and dignity of woman.
[04:55] Do you know, about whom you are talking?
[04:57] That person who always supported you in your bad times.
[05:01] He always used to pick an drop you but what happened now and what has he done?
[05:07] Mom
[05:09] You should tell Hamza that he can't force me at all.
[05:34] Mom
[05:36] This is not right.
[05:39] I am worried for Fabiha
[05:56] I am sorry.
[05:59] Arham please talk to me.
[06:03] Sanaya, there is no point in apologizing.
[06:05] You will raise questions again if anything will happen again. So, please let it be.
[06:09] I promise I won't raise any questions.
[06:13] Promises are needed in those relations where there is no trust.
[06:16] So you should trust me to avoid such promises.
[06:22] So tell me about the penalty.
[06:25] I will accept whatever you ask me to do.
[06:27] Tell me
[06:29] I am sorry.
[06:31] Sanaya, do you think that everything will become normal by saying sorry?
[06:37] Arham if you want...
Sanaya please
[06:40] Just leave me alone for a while because if we will stay together right now then it will create distances between us.
[06:48] Arham, listen to me.
Arham
[06:56] Here comes brother.
[06:57] Greetings.
Greetings.
[06:59] Come and have dinner with us brother.
[07:01] You proceed, I don't want to eat.
Hamza, come and sit here.
[07:10] Courier has delivered this letter.
[07:13] What's the matter? You look worried.
[07:18] Nothing mom, I am a bit tired today.
[07:23] What is this?
[07:28] It's a warning letter from office.
[07:35] I have received two lacs from savings.
[07:38] That two lacs won't be sufficient mom. How will I be able to arrange remaining eight lacs?
[07:42] Submit this amount and get some respite.
[07:45] They have already given me sufficient time.
[07:48] Now I will have to pay that amount at any cost.
[07:51] So what will happen now?
[07:52] That's why I asked you to take Fabiha's help but you didn't listen to me.
[07:58] What should I say?
[08:03] Brother, have dinner.
[08:07] There was no need to mention Fabiha at this moment.
[08:11] You made him angry for no reason.
[08:13] There was nothing to become angry. He is getting angry on minutest of things.
[08:22] Don't worry.
[08:24] That won't happen.
[08:26] And if something like that happens then you won't be blamed for that.
[08:43] I have become a liar because of your sir Arham.
[08:47] What do you mean?
[08:49] I mean to say that Hamza came here.
[08:53] And he thinks that I lied to him that sir Arham has gone to Islamabad.
[08:57] So that misunderstandings may be created between both of you so here you go.
[09:01] Now, I am facing false accusations because of you.
[09:07] Arham didn't go to Islamabad. Only mam Sanaya went there.
[09:12] Arham?
[09:15] Actually, aunt forbade me to tell you and mom otherwise she won't allow me to stay there.
[09:21] That's why I didn't tell at home.
Fabiha
[09:25] You lied to mom.
[09:27] So what would I do?
[09:29] If I had told mom then she wouldn't have allowed me to stay there.
[09:36] So, were you with Arham?
Yes.
[09:45] We went out, enjoyed rain and you know
[09:50] I took care of him in his fever and I like that so much.
[09:53] I never ever had such feelings for Hamza. Never.
[10:00] So, did Arham say something to you?
[10:05] What do you mean by that?
I mean
[10:08] That he likes you or there is something like that in his mind.
[10:17] He hasn't said anything yet but he will say that very soon.
[10:26] I was unlucky.
[10:29] But you are trying to make your fate.
[10:32] I pray to God that your fate may not betray you.
[10:38] You have to support me like this.
[11:47] This habit is very bad.
[11:53] You can't leave it easily.
[12:00] I can challenge you.
[12:06] You can't sleep without me.
[12:17] I won't sleep without you.
[12:29] That will never happen.
[12:52] Did you eat pain killer.
[12:55] That is a minor pain and will be cured with a tablet.
[13:03] Do you have any ointment for that pain which I am getting from my family.
[13:08] Did Hamza say anything again?
He doesn't say anything.
[13:13] He makes me guilty in front of mom.
[13:16] As if I am doing wrong to him.
Fabiha why don't you break your engagement?
[13:27] What will I do after doing that?
[13:30] There will be another person like Hamza come in my life.
[13:34] So it would be better for me to bear this patiently.
[13:46] Listen Fabiha, no one has the right to waste his life.
[13:51] You have still time, refuse his proposal.
[13:53] Otherwise, you won't have this opportunity after Nikah.
[14:05] I know that.
So why are you doing this to yourself?
[14:11] I don't know.
[14:12] Maybe I haven't met anyone yet for whom I can refuse this proposal.
[14:17] Really?
[14:19] What do you want to see in your life partner?
[14:22] How he should be?
[14:36] Do you know Arham that a man feels that a woman wants money, big house, bank balance and a car. And this is only obligation on man.
[14:46] So, what else?
[14:53] A woman only needs love from her husband.
[14:59] His all time should belong to her.
[15:03] That's all.
[15:05] But a man only cares about his rights and doesn't care of about others' rights.
There is nothing like that Fabiha.
[15:12] I am right Arham.
[15:14] You are a man that's why you are denying me.
[15:18] Just leave it.
[15:20] It's too late, you should sleep.
[15:22] Otherwise you will have to give clarifications in front of Mam Sanaya again.
[15:26] OK, take care.
[15:29] Bye.
Bye
[15:40] What has happened to me?
[15:42] Why I am liking to talk to Fabiha?
[15:47] I have started to feel her absence.
[15:51] I am unable to stop myself from thinking about her.
[16:59] What are you doing here at this time?
[17:00] Come with me.
How rude?
[17:02] Do you have any idea that I have been trying to call you from last 90 minutes but your number was continuously busy. With whom were you talking?
[17:09] Hamza.
[17:11] You are here at this time?
[17:13] What happened?
[17:16] If my phone was busy then I was talking to someone else. Right?
[17:19] No, no. You are misunderstanding my son.
[17:23] With whom will she talk at this time?
[17:25] I am not misunderstanding aunt, her phone was busy.
[17:29] Are you doubting me?
[17:31] What happened? What is this noise?
[17:33] I am not doubting you. I am asking a question and you need to respond.
But you don't have any right to ask question.
[17:41] Fabiha
[17:42] Bring your phone.
Mom.
[17:43] Bring your phone. Go.
[17:49] Farheen, bring her phone. Why are you standing here, go.
[18:00] You don't believe me at all. You only believe on his words.
[18:06] Farheen, why aren't you coming? Bring her phone quickly.
[18:17] Take it and check.
[18:37] Are you satisfied now? Or you want something else?
[18:41] You give Hamza so much importance.
[18:43] He doesn't trust your daughter. Will you marry me with him?
[18:54] Fabiha, I am sorry. I got so emotional and I was unable to understand anything.
[19:02] What should I do with your emotions? Will I pass my life with your emotions?
[19:07] It's useless to talk to you.
Fabiha stop. Listen to me.
[19:30] Mom, I am bringing water for you.
[19:40] Shouting reveals that how good a person's character is.
[19:44] And you have done enough.
[19:47] We can manage household expenses from Farheen's earning. Think about your marriage.
Oh really
[19:55] Then listen to me that I am not going to marry Hamza.
[20:00] So please tell aunt about my decision.
[20:21] Greetings mom.
[20:23] Greetings. You are back safely.
[20:28] Yes mom, I am back. How are you?
[20:36] What happened mom?
Nothing. 
[20:40] I have heard my daughter's voice after a long time.
[20:44] That's why I got emotional.
[20:47] Because I am your mother.
[20:49] Why are you doing this mom. Don't cry like this. Be happy.
[20:58] Just leave it. Tell me how is everyone at home? Brother, sister-in-law and Anaya.
[21:02] By the grace of God, everyone is fine and everything is alright.
[21:08] Well, what's your plan for tonight's dinner?
[21:13] Are you coming tonight?
[21:16] Sanaya, I am asking something.
[21:19] Yes mom, I have just arrived last night. Let me talk to Arham.
[21:24] OK, let me tell Somiya, she will make all arrangements.
[21:29] And she is a perfectionist.
[21:31] OK take care. Bye.
OK mom, bye.
[21:47] Fabiha hasn't woken up yet?
[21:51] I don't know.
[22:16] The scene you created last night in front of Hamza.
You are still favoring him.
[22:24] Despite knowing that he accused me and doubted me.
[22:29] Fabiha, what are you talking about?
[22:32] He neither doubted you nor accused you.
[22:36] He was talking to you with so much love and respect, it was you who was misbehaving with him.
[22:41] Wow, you understood his every action but you couldn't see his accusation on me.
[22:49] You should have kicked him out of the house.
[22:52] Hey, are you mad? Have you lost your mind? If you were speaking the truth then why were you shouting?
[23:00] Shouting only shows how a person's character is, it doesn't show that he is right. Now it's enough.
[23:08] We can manage household expenses from Farheen's earning. You should think about your marriage.
[23:13] Oh really?
[23:16] Then listen to me that I am not going to marry Hamza.
[23:21] Please tell aunt Nasreen.
[23:28] Well, well.
[23:30] She ruined everything.
[23:32] I told you that she is an independent bird.
[23:36] She won't spare time in flying high and she has done that.
[23:41] Now you won't be able to catch her.
[23:44] What is she saying?
[23:46] What happened to her?
[23:48] Mom, why aren't you eating? Please eat.
[25:42] Arham
[25:52] Good morning.
[25:56] Good morning.
[26:00] What's this?
[26:02] It is said that if we start our day with expressing our love then day becomes good.
[26:08] Thank you.
[26:24] Good morning.
[26:29] Good morning
[26:46] Thank you.
[26:49] Only a wife knows that how to appease her husband.
[26:57] You couldn't sleep at night.
[27:01] It's evident from your face.
[27:06] Who told you to sleep here because of anger?
[27:10] You were angry with me then why did you express your anger on yourself?
[27:14] Scold me, express your anger and scold me.
[27:18] But never go away from me.
[27:22] Please
[27:28] So, your anger is over. Right?
[27:32] Hmm
[27:36] Mom has invited us for dinner tonight. Will you go there?
[27:42] OK, we will go there.
[27:48] I have brought coffee for you.
[27:50] Thank you.
[27:52] Breakfast is also ready. Come quickly.
[28:08] I am waiting for you.
[28:11] Come quickly.
[28:14] I am coming.
[28:38] What did you say to me?
[28:42] I am right mom. I should have refused this proposal much earlier.
[28:46] But what has happened now that you are refusing?
[28:49] You know about everything and I am refusing because I don't want this to happen again.
[28:55] I warn you if you will say anything to Hamza. I will treat you in a very bad way.
[29:01] Mom, why are you putting my future at stake and why do you want to push me into a dark well?
[29:05] The walls of that well are so high that I won't be able to come out even if I want to.
[29:08] So you should sink in that well and don't think about fleeing from there. Understand?
[29:13] And listen to me very carefully Fabiha.
[29:15] If you will refuse to marry Hamza then you will see my dead face.
[29:19] Now my life is in your hands. Understand?
[29:24] Mom
[30:44] Arham
[30:48] Can anyone find charger of my mobile?
[30:53] Sanaya
[30:57] What's the matter mom? Is everything alright?
[30:59] What's wrong, I am ringing bell and calling you but you don't even listen.
[31:05] I am unable to find my charger, that was used to be here.
[31:07] My phone battery is dead, how will Hadiya call me.
[31:12] Here is your charger.
[31:13] Where was this charger? Fabiha plugs in here.
[31:18] It was in kitchen.
[31:21] It's just a minor thing. You have got your charger.
It's not a minor thing.
[31:26] Fabiha takes care of minutest of thing.
[31:30] I don't feel uncomfortable but I can't spend a single day without her.
[31:35] Mom where are my goggles?
In your cupboard drawer.
[31:40] Mom, they are not there.
[31:43] OK, I am giving you.
Mom, let me tell you that Sanaya's mother has invited us for dinner.
[31:49] She wants everyone to join them.
[31:52] OK, go there but I am not in a mood to go there.
Mom, she has invited everyone.
[31:56] She will feel bad if you won't go there.
[31:58] I don't care.
[32:00] What will I get after becoming a good person in her eyes?
[32:06] What will you do alone here? It would be better if you will go with us.
[32:12] There is no issue in going with you, the issue is becoming a burden on your wife.
[32:17] But if you want me to go there with you then ask Fabiha to come.
[32:20] If she will come then I will go there.
[32:23] At least she will take care of me.
[32:27] OK, if mom feels comfortable with Fabiha then I will call her.
[32:34] Right?
[32:35] Right.
[32:38] OK
[32:58] Hi, what's up mam Sanaya? Is everything alright?
[33:03] Aren't you committed to go somewhere today?
[33:06] No, what happened?
Today, my mom has invited us.
[33:11] And mom doesn't do anything without you.
[33:16] In fact she feels very relax in your company.
[33:21] So, can you please come for a short while.
[33:27] Let me try mam Sanaya.
[33:29] Don't try, you will have to come Fabiha. If you won't come then mom won't go there with us.
[33:34] I can talk to aunt if you want.
No, don't do that, I mean, let me talk to mom.
[33:41] So, you are coming.
[33:44] Yes.
OK.
[33:57] What should I do?
[35:47] Mom
[35:50] I am sorry, I shouldn't have said that much. That happened because of anger.
[35:55] I won't say anything to Hamza. I swear.
[35:59] If you want to make me happy then obey me and get married peacefully.
[36:05] Mom, look at me, why are hasting so much?
[36:09] Why are you making the biggest decision of my life out of emotions?
I have already made my decision.
[36:16] Now it's your turn. Do you accept or not?
[36:24] Mom, I need some time.
[36:26] How much time?
[36:29] I don't know.
[36:31] When a person is boarded on a sinking boat then it's become difficult for him to make any decision.
[36:36] And you are in same situation.
[36:39] Mom.
But I have made my decision.
[36:42] I will call sister Nasreen today and fix your marriage date. Do you understand?
[36:48] Mom
[36:49] Mom
[36:51] What happened?
[36:52] Mom, police has arrested Hamza.
What are you talking about?
[36:58] I am right mom. Police has arrested Hamza for stealing ten lac rupees.
[37:02] O my God.
[37:04] Haniya called me, she was crying badly and told me that aunt Nasreen is crying badly as well.
[37:09] What will happen now?
I don't know.
[37:12] Haniya was calling Fabiha but when she didn't receive her call then she called me.
[37:18] My phone is charging.
I am cursing that time, when I allowed you to do job because of our poverty.
[37:25] But that allowance didn't mean to give you freedom.
[37:28] Mom, what's my fault in all this?
[37:30] He has been arrested because he has stolen money.
You are confusing us Fabiha.
[37:33] I have understood everything. Take this phone and call Nasreen. Take it.
[37:41] Haniya, how do I control myself.
[37:49] There is no one to help us.
Sister Fabiha is there for us.
[37:55] I called sister Farheen, she will do something.
[37:58] Only our loved ones support us in difficult times.
[38:01] Yes, you are right. Call Fabiha, let me talk to her.
[38:06] She will do something.
[38:09] Sister Fabiha.
Hi.
[38:13] Haniya, what happened?
Aunt, police has arrested brother.
[38:17] You don't have to worry. Tell sister Nasreen that there is no need to worry.
[38:23] Mom is crying badly.
[38:25] Please ask sister Fabiha to do something.
[38:30] Give me the phone, let me talk to her.
[38:34] This is not right sister Shaheen.
[38:36] Have you forgotten that when Fabiha was in trouble then my son was so worried for her.
[38:43] He borrowed money from everyone and paid that loan. He even went to jail.
[38:51] Isn't this Fabiha's duty to support Hamza in this difficult time?
[38:55] You are absolutely right sister Nasreen.
[38:59] I am unable to understand that where should I go and to whom I should ask for help.
[39:04] Why are you getting worried sister Nasreen?
[39:07] Fabiha is here and she will handle everything.
[39:10] OK, bye.
[39:15] Mom, for God's sake stop crying. I am bring something for you and you will have to eat that.
