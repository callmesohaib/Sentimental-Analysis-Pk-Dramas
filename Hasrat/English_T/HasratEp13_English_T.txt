[00:13] You were their grandmother, you could have stopped them.
I'm embarrassed.
[00:17] I'm the one who is embarrassed in front of the kids. I didn't expect this from you at all.
[00:25] Thank you so much for reminding me my responsibilities.
[00:30] You couldn't keep the children with you for four days, you have humiliated me.
[00:36] I asked for money, that doesn't mean that is an excuse to break off the relationship.
[00:41] Lower your voice...
These kids are the ones that they ousted!
[00:46] These are the kids who came alone from there.
[01:00] Hamza used a rickshaw?
[01:17] Go and feed mother. She hasn't eaten anything since morning, she hasn't taken her medicine as well.
[01:23] What, why?
You're acting as though you don't know.
[01:28] She already hated me...
[01:32] but now she's saying that it would be better for her to eat poison than eat food that I cooked.
[01:37] But she loves you... so go.
[01:40] Sister, you've hurt her heart, it will take her some time to get better.
[01:47] She's the one who has set time for me. She has given me a month to leave.
[01:53] I think she will shove me out of here.
[01:57] It's not like that. You are the honor of this house and mother respects you.
[02:02] One should live respectfully, for people who don't no one even attends their funeral.
[02:07] No Fabiha, if one endures injustice, then that does have an effect.
[02:11] That's why there are people like you and Hamza.
[02:15] Who earn and agree to everything. Like me, people who stand up for themselves become the bad guy.
[02:25] Sister, the day you realize your mistake...
[02:29] you will understand everything..
[02:33] The day time forces you to think, that day you will understand the injustice done to me.
[02:54] Go away now, she's hungry, feed her.
[03:06] Greetings*
[03:13] Hamza... where is your bike?
[03:19] What? I didn't tell her anything.
[03:23] Why are you looking at her? I saw you getting off that rickshaw...
[03:28] Tell me where the bike is...
[03:32] I've kept it under possession.
[03:35] Under possession?
[03:37] You bought a bike just two months ago and now you've kept it under possession?
[03:42] What need was there?
I'll take it back in a few months, for now, I needed a loan.
[03:50] That's what I'm asking. What was the loan for?
[03:54] Mother, why are you being stubborn? There was a reason for it.
[03:59] Then there must be a name for that reason. Why aren't you telling me it's name?
[04:09] Fabiha needed money.
For how much did you keep the bike under possession for?
[04:15] Sixty thousand.
Why did she need so much money?
[04:21] Right now, I can't tell you anything. I will tell you when the time is right.
[04:28] I'm very tired, I'm going to my room.
[04:54] Mother...
[04:57] I've brought you dinner.
[05:01] How was your first day?
It was great, but if you keep being like this, I'll have to stop working.
[05:08] Sister told me that you didn't eat all day and you didn't take your medicine as well
[05:13] Tell her to not do my errands. I'm not so forced that I can't do them on my own.
[05:20] She's your daughter... I admit that she made a mistake, but it wasn't a sin.
[05:26] Are you here as a lawyer.
No, I'm here to straighten things out between you two.
[05:32] Tell me honestly, don't you love her?
[05:37] Don't you are about her? About her heart, about her future...
[05:42] That's what's killing me.
[05:45] Seeing her going mad over Haris...
[05:50] make me restless.
[05:54] That's why I hate love, it renders a person useless.
[05:59] Mother, it's not a bad thing to love. One should just know how to recognize between right and wrong.
[06:07] When emotions grow strong on a person, then one loses sight of right and wrong.
[06:15] And that is exactly what sister's condition is, and we should understand that.
[06:19] Otherwise we will distance her from us... because she can't see love hidden behind this behavior of yours.
[06:27] Wow... my dear has become very smart.
[06:37] Hamza has sold his bike to return Haroon's money.
[06:43] What?
[06:45] I don't know if I'll ever be able to repay him for it.
[06:50] This is not a favor he's done to you, rather it is the love he has for you.
[07:04] Who is it? Hamza?
[07:25] Hello...
I thought that you wouldn't pick up.
[07:32] I called to remind you that...
[07:34] tomorrow will be two days..
[07:39] I'm sure Hamza has arranged for the money.
[07:46] We remembered it.
You have till tomorrow..
[07:51] Remember the punishment for not returning the money.
[07:54] This time Hamza will be my mark.
[07:58] You know what they say...
[08:03] A lover's funeral is filled with dust and ashes!
[08:11] Farewell.
[08:17] It is a lover's funeral...
[08:21] it will be filled with dust and ashes.
[08:43] I refused to not leave your children with someone
[08:50] And look how you were humiliated in front of your in-laws.
[09:00] When a son starts thinking his mother as his enemy.....
[09:06] then nothing can be done.
[09:13] It is said that a daughter's guarantee of love...
[09:17] is in the respect of one's son-in-law.
[09:23] But I'm sure her family doesn't know.
[09:26] It seems that your mother-in-law is your true enemy.
[09:33] And I want you to swear to me that until...
[09:37] you get your due respect back...
[09:42] you won't return to your in-laws.
[09:47] Understand?
[09:52] What are you saying mother?
What did I say that was so wrong?
[09:56] It was your job to have your husband respected, but you can't get time of your job.
[10:01] Listen to me... in that house...
[10:05] it wasn't only Arhum's children that were humiliated, but my grandchildren were humiliated as well.
[10:16] Thank God that Fabiha was present at home, otherwise who would have looked after these poor souls.
[10:21] The way they returned home starving...
[10:26] You should be thankful to her.
[10:30] Even though she was a stranger she looked after your kids, otherwise nowadays no one has the heart to do it.
[10:38] Not their grandmother, and she has proven that.
[10:44] Mother is right.
[10:49] Last time I forgave Hadia's mistake, but not this time.
[10:54] This is a matter about my kids.
[10:58] I can tolerate everything, but not this.
[11:01] Your family will have to apologize.
[11:11] Let's go kids, we're running late for school.
[11:15] Come on, let's go.
[11:29] I'll see...
[11:33] whether a daughter is loyal to her mother, or a wife is loyal to her husband.
[11:57] Junaid, come and have breakfast.
[12:00] Hey... Junaid...
[12:18] Here is your juice...
[12:21] Not now...
[12:28] You will wear this color today.
[12:32] What difference does it make?
[12:36] I find not difference in clothes and a covering cloth one dress a dead body in.
[12:43] All I can do is stay within these four walls.
[12:49] Why do you say such depressive things?
[12:53] You have a grand children... good kids... you have a car... and a home, what else do you need?
[13:02] Not many people have your luck. You have a daughter-in-law that cares for you...
[13:10] Otherwise you can't even imagine the things I've seen.
[13:15] She cares for me?
[13:17] The state you see me in is because of her.
[13:23] She's the one who's done this to me...  don't go after her face... she's not that innocent.
[13:32] She doesn't seem like that to me...
[13:38] I thought that before... but she showed me her true colors gradually.
[13:48] She only cares about herself and her job.
[13:53] Her job!
[13:55] But auntie, to live a life in modern times, a job is necessary, isn't it?
[14:00] And think how much your son gains from her.
[14:08] I brought a daughter-in-law to live in this house...
[14:12] to take care of me.
[14:16] That she would drink tea with me in the evening.
[14:21] But it didn't turn out that way.
Such a minor complaint?
[14:25] I'll take this complaint away for your right away! I'll have tea with you every evening now.
[14:30] That too with green cardamom. I'll make one for you and one for me.
[14:35] Now I know that tea is just an excuse...
[14:39] You need a friend that you can talk to.
[14:45] From now on I'm your friend... whatever you want to talk about...
[14:49] you can to me about it.
[14:52] But for that you'll need your energy and for that you need to have juice.
[14:58] Which I've brought for you and you will drink it as well.
[15:03] Here you are...
[15:12] Mother...
[15:14] Let's go and eat something. You haven't eaten anything since morning.
[15:18] I'm not hungry, I'll eat it when I am...
[15:22] Why are you so concerned about me?
[15:25] Mother, I've always been concerned for you.
And that's a great favor you've done me.
[15:30] I've done you some favors as well. I treated you like my daughter...
[15:35] I took care of your happiness more than I did mine...
[15:39] Mother... then why now you are acting like a mother-in-law with me now?
[15:44] I made no mistakes... I just tried to make brother Arhum and Shenaya realize...
[15:49] Why do you think I've committed a sin?
I do not want to talk about this topic?
[15:56] Go to your room.
[16:00] People are right when they say that no matter how hard one tries...
[16:05] a daughter-in-law can never truly become a daughter.
[16:17] I've sent them all the account details. That file has everything that was causing us a problem, so everything is sorted.
[16:24] Tell me, is the client coming for the meeting tomorrow?
[16:27] Yes sir, everything is on time.
[16:30] The meeting is fixed, I'll be there on time.
Be there on time tomorrow.
[16:36] Thanks sir.
Thank you.
[16:54] Why did you do bring it for me?
[16:56] I was taking it for auntie, I saw you came back from work so I brought one for you.
[17:00] Besides... it was a good deed, I don't think of it like a favor.
Okay...
[17:07] Miss...
Fabiha...
[17:12] Fabiha, thanks for yesterday.
For what?
[17:16] It was very kind of you for taking care of the kids, even though no one asked you to.
[17:20] It's okay... I understand that taking care of kids is not part of my job description...
[17:25] but if you want I can take care of the kids alongside your mother. I don't mind.
[17:31] And we've already talked about the salary.
[17:35] Thank you.
[17:38] Thank you so much.
[18:06] I will not go... do you hear?
[18:09] I will not go to his home!
You will go Sonia!
[18:14] Will you force me?
I will if I have to!
[18:17] It would be better if you listen to me.
What if I don't?
[18:23] This relationship is hanging over three words now. If my sister can't stay married, then so can't you.
[18:49] Haris... it's been twenty days since you left...
[18:52] and you didn't call me once... and you're not picking up when I'm calling you.
[19:06] Haris... I know that you are hearing my messages and that you're getting my calls as well.
[19:11] You can hear my messages, but not talk to me?
[19:15] Do you have any idea how worried I am? I'm telling you right now...
[19:18] If you don't pick up my calls now...
[19:28] Maybe you're forgetting that Fabiha is off to work.
[19:31] I came here for you.
[19:35] Haris didn't call, right?
[19:50] The look on your face says it all.
[19:55] I think you haven't contacted Haris in twenty days.
[20:02] I'm sure you must be happy seeing me helpless like this.
[20:08] That's what I wanted to save you from.
[20:12] But you don't listen to me.
[20:15] Mother, maybe you are forgetting that Haris is still my husband...
[20:20] I'm sure he's busy setting his new home. And with his new job, I'm sure he has a million other problems.
[20:26] I'm sure he'll call me as soon as he finds time.
[20:31] I'm believe in Haris and his love.
[20:35] It's just you don't believe in your mother's love, right?
[20:42] I never got my mother's love.
[20:46] If she did love me, then I wouldn't be so blindly in love with Haris.
[21:12] Show me the final designs I gave you. I think we might need to change a few things...
[21:19] I'll tell you and you can look after it, okay?
[21:31] Shenaya...
[21:35] Our new product has some problems in design and I think we need to change it.
[21:40] I've mailed the new drawings to you all, please check it out...
[21:43] And... I want those drawings back in thirty minutes... 
[21:47] Please...
Shenaya...
[21:57] I only came here to tell my sister how ashamed I am.
[22:03] After what Sonia did I cannot even look you and Arhum in the eye.
[22:09] Not at all brother...
[22:13] There is no need for you to be ashamed because of what sister Sonia did.
[22:21] It is true that I didn't alongside Arhum I also didn't like what sister did.
[22:27] It is also true that kids aren't sister Sonia's responsibility.
[22:32] But, I'm just sad...
[22:35] that she shouldn't have done this with the kids.
[22:40] That would have had such a bad affect on the kids.
[22:44] Arhum is right to be angry...
[22:56] Brother... Arhum's anger...
[23:02] can only end on one condition.
[23:04] Sure... what is it?
[23:13] Brother...
[23:22] This time... alongside sister Sonia...
[23:28] you will have to apologize to Arhum as well.
[23:48] And...
[23:52] I support Arhum...
[23:58] on his decision.
[24:06] I'll bring coffee for you.
[24:28] It's great that this happened. It was like sister Sonia slapped sister-in-law in the face.
[24:34] I'm enjoying hearing about it.
[24:37] She used to be proud of her family... but it all came raining down on her.
[24:45] Indeed! She made us to look like monsters in front of her family.
[24:52] But now her family is defamed in front of my son.
[24:56] The iron is hot and ready to strike.
[25:01] We won't get another chance if things settle down.
[25:05] Indeed... and I've told Arhum...
[25:09] not to go to his in-laws until and unless they respect him. And he knows how to get that done.
[25:16] He's my son.
Did sister Shenaya not say anything against it?
[25:23] Yes... she's very angry about it.
[25:28] She's worried that her husband won't trust her again.
[25:34] If only I was there to see it.
[25:37] So what... you can come here now. It's not like Dubai is far away.
[25:41] This time bring Sameer with you, understand?
[25:44] Forgive me... last time I came I was humiliated, I don't want the same to happen to my husband.
[25:50] Those days are over when Arhum was Shenaya's strength, right now he's weak.
[25:58] And what can a weak man do? Right now is the time to make him dance on his fingertips.
[26:04] You're right.
[26:06] I will talk to him.
Of course!
[26:10] I will be waiting for your answer. 
[26:55] What are you doing?
[26:59] Nothing, just making tea.
[27:01] Let me make it.
It's okay, I'll make it.
[27:07] I don't have a problem. I have to make daliya for your mother, so I'll make tea for you as well.
[27:13] Alright sure
[27:16] How many cups were you making?
[27:20] One cup, do you want one?
[27:23] I don't drink tea.
[27:27] Why are you smiling?
[27:31] I had a feeling that you drink six cups of tea at a time.
[27:36] I've never made tea, Shenaya always made it.
[27:40] I came early from work so I decided to make tea.
[27:46] Anyways... bring the tea to my mother's room. Thank you.
[28:20] Greetings mother.
[28:24] Greetings to you too. Why are you home early today?
[28:28] Yes...
[28:30] I went to Shenaya's office to meet her.
[28:32] Really... what did you two talk about? I think Arhum is very angry at Shenaya, I've been calling her since morning...
[28:38] but she isn't picking up.
[28:41] She won't...
What do you mean?
[28:47] Arhum has given her the option to choose between her brother or her husband.
[28:55] What? How can I be that I don't visit my daughter and she doesn't visit me.
[29:05] I understand that.
[29:08] That's why I've decided that Sonia and I will visit Arhum in the evening to apologize.
[29:14] Wait a minute. How could you even think I would go there to apologize.
[29:24] You will have to because this time it is your fault.
[29:27] Mother...
Junaid is right. We cannot ignore your mistake.
[29:34] I will not go there. Did you hear?
[29:38] I will not go to her home...
You will Sonia!
[29:42] Will you force me?
I will if I have to, it would be wise if you listen.
[29:49] What if I don't.
[29:52] Our relationship is maintained on three words...
[29:55] If my sister loses her home, so will you.
[30:19] Wow... by God's good grace...
[30:24] How come you miss your mother today.
[30:27] I miss you all the time... I just lose track of time.
[30:34] Do you remember that before getting married, before going to work... and after returning from work...
[30:41] you used to always come to me.
[30:47] After your marriage, you seemed to have lost track of time.
[30:50] There is no set time to meet one's mother. I can see you whenever I want.
[30:57] I've made your daliya how you wanted me to.
[31:03] Here is your tea
[31:07] Pass it to me.
[31:09] My scarf.
[31:11] Sure
[31:18] Yes... thank you. Bless you.
[31:25] Your insulin first.
[31:28] Yes of course...
[31:44] You have a very soft set of hands.
[31:49] He dropped it on his hand... it will blister...
[31:54] What did you do my dear....
[32:24] Hurry up!
[32:28] Hamza, where are you going?
[32:30] I have an important errand to run.
[32:33] What is it that you're taking an off from work to do it?
[32:39] What's the matter mother? You've never asked me so many questions before.
[32:44] You've never hidden anything from your mother before this as well.
[32:50] Trust me mother...
[32:54] Let me check...
[32:57] Hamza... I feel worried.
[33:01] Why does it seem to me that you...
[33:04] have done something and you're hiding it... swear on my life...
[33:10] Is everything okay?
What's the matter mother, what are you saying?
[33:16] Hamza...
Mother...
[33:19] Are you okay?
Yes I am...
[33:24] Why are you coming in? Brother!
[33:30] Hamza...
What are you doing here?
[33:33] What is the matter?
You'll know that once we take you to the station.
[33:37] Wait.... listen to me...
[33:41] Come with us...
Where are you taking him?
[33:47] Wait a minute... what's going on?
You've done something big..
[33:56] You've stolen... you stole Mr. Haroon's money. You're a thief...
[34:03] No... Hamza is not a thief... do not take him..
[34:10] Whatever you want to say you can say at the station.
[34:14] Hamza... Hamza... Hamza...
[34:24] Don't worry...
[34:27] Call Fabiha...
My dear...
[34:56] Thank you.
[35:07] Hello.
[35:10] What? Hania... hello
[35:15] Hello.
[35:38] Lord have mercy...
[35:41] Hello... Hania is everything alright.
Sister Fabiha...
[35:47] The police has taken away brother.
What?
[35:51] Why?
Someone named Haroon filed a complaint...
[35:57] Let me talk to her. Fabiha... the police has taken Hamza...
[36:01] My dear do something... Hamza didn't do anything...
[36:05] He's innocent... call him... they were mentioning someone named Haroon.
[36:12] Hello.
[36:13] Hania.. hello..
Fabiha...
[36:17] Is everything okay?
[36:28] I'm sorry... there's an emergency...
[36:31] Tell me about it.
Mr. Haroon please let Hamza go, it's not his fault.
[36:38] Do one thing... go to the station and help your friend. Do not call me.
[36:45] You will gain nothing by calling me. Take care. Farewell.
[36:53] Hey... what's the matter?
[36:58] Tell me where you have to go, I'll drop you off.
[37:01] No... don't waste your time with me... I'll go myself.
[37:06] I have no problem. Where do we have to go?
[37:10] Police station...
What?
[37:14] You will not go to the police station alone.
[37:19] Women who have no fathers or brother, have to be act like men.
[37:23] The police have arrested Hamza, I cannot leave him alone.
[37:29] Alright... I will not let you go there alone.
[37:34] My friend's father is in the police, maybe we can find a solution.
[37:39] Relax... which police station?
