[01:36] Saad, come
[01:40] Hello friend.
Hello.
[01:43] You are looking so happy today.
[01:46] Yes, I am so happy and you have to guess that why am I so happy today?
[01:50] Do I have to guess?
Yes.
[01:52] Your result has announced.
That will be announced next week.
[01:57] Brother Ali has got job confirmation in Islamabad.
[02:00] His probation period is three months but it's only been a month since he has gone there.
[02:05] Oh what is that?
Think.
[02:10] Maheen.
[02:11] Maheen has gone back to her in-laws.
[02:13] Then what else?
[02:14] If she heard that then she will kill you. No she hasn't gone back.
[02:17] Wrong answer.
[02:18] At least give me some hints. Tell me something.
[02:21] Look at me.
[02:23] Look at me very carefully.
[02:26] Oh, Adeel.
[02:28] Adeel's family is coming to fix your marriage date.
[02:31] No but you are very close.
[02:34] Think a bit more, maybe you can give right answer.
[02:36] I am not thinking, you are not giving me any hints.
[02:39] Now tell me by yourself.
Saad.
[02:44] Adeel is coming to Karachi.
I said the same thing.
[02:53] Are you getting married?
No.
[02:58] Adeel is coming with his friend's procession.
[03:01] That's nonsense.
[03:04] Adeel should bring his own procession here along with his friend.
[03:09] You are in a hurry to get rid of me.
[03:11] No, I am not in a hurry but the worrying thing is that even Adeel is not in any kind of hurry.
[03:17] But if I was in his place then I wouldn't delay this much.
[03:21] Saad, stop your nonsense.
[03:24] You are my friend and fiance of my younger sister as well.
[03:27] Don't you feel ashamed by saying this.
[03:29] No, I don't feel ashamed.
[03:31] And isn't this sufficient that you are my friend.
[03:32] What do you mean by fiance of younger sister?
[03:35] This relation has no significance in front of friendship.
[03:38] First you decide whether I am your friend or best female friend.
[03:42] But what is the difference between these two.
[03:44] There is a difference of gender between these two.
[03:45] Oh I see.
[03:47] If that is the case then
[03:49] Then I am your best female friend and you are my friend.
[03:52] Perfect.
[03:54] I pray to God that uncle and aunt may not allow Adeel to come here.
[03:59] Then that will be a great fun.
[04:01] You are so bad.
[04:04] Tell me, am I looking good in this color?
[04:07] Hmm
[04:08] It's so so.
I knew you will say this.
[04:11] I shouldn't even talk to you.
Hey, listen to me.
[04:16] Zara
[04:18] What? What are you talking about brother?
[04:21] Will you take our permission for Adeel's visit to our home now?
[04:24] No, there is no such thing.
[04:26] In fact, things have changed now.
[04:30] Adeel and Zara are married now.
[04:32] So it doesn't matter, this is Adeel's aunt's house.
[04:37] He can come here whenever he wants and he can stay here as long as he wants.
[04:39] So tell this to your nephew yourself.
[04:43] He asked me to call you and take permission.
[04:48] Wow.
[04:49] If that is the case then tell him.
[04:52] That your aunt said that you are my nephew so be like that
[04:55] but if you want to become son-in-law then I will treat him in very harsh way.
[05:00] OK. OK
[05:04] Greetings.
[05:06] Greetings. You are late today.
[05:10] Yes, I got late because of my extra class.
[05:17] By the way, didn't Saad come today?
[05:22] Saad roams around here all the time.
[05:25] Where will he go? He has nothing to do.
[05:31] So now you have issue with this thing as well.
[05:35] What do you want to say that I have issue with everything?
[05:39] And you don't consider my problems genuine.
[05:42] Why do you classify everything as right or wrong?
[05:46] You should talk in a normal way.
[05:48] Yes, I am not normal.
[05:50] I am stuck between right and wrong.
[05:52] Right?
[05:53] But you are a normal person so don't talk to me. Just leave.
[05:58] Yes.
[05:59] I won't talk to you. I don't like to talk to you.
[06:06] How are you?
[06:08] Hmm
[06:10] I am perfectly fine. When did you come?
[06:11] I have just come here and I think you have just returned from university.
[06:17] Yes, and as usual I am entering the house and you are leaving.
[06:22] Yes, I am going with Zara.
[06:24] She wants to buy something for Adeel.
[06:26] Oh I see.
[06:29] So, what will you buy for me?
[06:32] For you?
Hmm.
[06:34] Good question.
[06:36] I will bring whatever you will ask me.
[06:38] Let's do one thing, you can also go with us.
[06:42] You can buy whatever you like.
[06:43] No, I have just come back and very tired. I don't want to go.
[06:47] OK, tell me what do I bring for you?
[06:50] By the way, has brother Adeel told Zara that what he is bringing for Zara?
[06:57] No, he hasn't told her.
[06:59] So why do I tell you about my choice?
[07:02] Well, I want to see that what else do you like among beautiful things other than me.
[07:09] Oh I see, so now you will test me.
[07:11] Let's go Saad, I am ready.
[07:15] Will you go in this dress?
[07:17] Yes, what's wrong with my attire?
[07:19] Go and change your dress.
[07:20] Why do I change? I am looking so good.
[07:23] By the way, I am so happy today.
[07:26] Because Adeel is coming.
[07:29] Let's go, you are so talkative. Bye.
[07:31] Please bring something for me. Don't come back empty handed.
[07:34] There are prayers for you.
[08:14] Here is your tea.
[08:15] And you should advise Zenny that she shouldn't misbehave with me.
[08:20] What did she say to you?
[08:22] She said that all problems in my life are only because of me.
[08:25] There is no fault of my in-laws and I am guilty for everything.
[08:30] Why would she say this?
[08:31] How do I know? You should ask her.
[08:33] And advise her in your own way because everyone will feel uncomfortable if I will advise her.
[08:41] What was Zenny saying?
[08:44] Oh.
[08:46] I forgot.
[08:47] She asked me to bring something for her.
[08:50] But you didn't buy anything for her.
[08:53] I asked her that what does she want but she didn't tell me.
[08:55] So how do I know, what she would like.
[08:57] If she won't tell you anything then won't you buy anything for her?
[09:00] So what's wrong in telling me?
[09:01] You also tell me when you need something.
[09:04] Yes but she is your fiance and I am just your friend.
[09:07] And girls don't like to tell everything.
[09:10] They want their loved one to understand their feelings without saying anything.
[09:14] Why? What's the reason behind this?
[09:17] Because in this way they feel that their bond is very strong and they fantasize such things.
[09:23] So such girls should get engaged with rich boys.
[09:28] Because they understand everything without listening anything.
[09:30] That's really stupid. It's not funny at all.
[09:33] Let's do one thing, we will buy something for her.
[09:37] You are newly engaged with her. Build some understanding with her.
[09:40] OK, we will buy something.
[09:42] But tell me one thing.
[09:44] Do Adeel and you understand each others' feelings like this, without even saying anything?
[09:50] Hmm
[09:52] Yes we do understand so often.
[09:55] Wow, wow, wow, what a strong bond between Karachi's Zara and doctor Adeel of Hyderabad. Right?
[10:02] Both of you understand each others' feelings despite of such a long distance.
[10:04] And that too without saying or listening anything. Wow that's wonderful.
[10:09] Well.
[10:11] Eat this sandwich now.
[10:13] Adeel will feel so happy that we take good care of his wife.
[10:16] Saad, isn't there any difference for you at home or outside home? People are looking at us.
[10:20] Who is looking?
[10:23] Hey, why are you staring at us?
[10:25] We are not on a date.
[10:27] She is married and I am engaged.
[10:30] Saad.
We are friends.
[10:35] You are so crazy. I won't come with you next time.
[10:50] Mom.
Hmm.
[10:53] Mom.
[10:54] Stop Adeel.
[10:56] It's not good to go to his in-laws house like this.
[11:00] He shouldn't go there.
Why do I stop him?
[11:03] And by the way, he didn't ask me.
[11:05] He talked to your dad and he has allowed him to go there.
[11:08] So, you didn't say anything to dad.
[11:11] He said that Adeel is not going to his in-laws house.
[11:16] He is going to Karachi with his friend's procession.
[11:19] So it is not possible that he goes to Karachi and doesn't meet his aunt.
[11:24] His aunt will mind that.
[11:27] He is not going with his friend's procession. It's just a drama.
[11:30] Madam Zara must have called him and asked him to come.
[11:33] She must be feeling sad.
[11:35] That's why, I hate this mobile phone so much.
[11:39] The girls these days trap boys by talking on phone.
[11:44] Then they don't listen to their mothers.
[11:46] So the same thing is happening to you son mom.
[11:51] If he asked dad then he should have asked you as well.
[11:54] Madam Zara must have forbidden him that don't tell your mom.
[11:59] Now, she will incite him against us. You will see.
[12:04] What do I say about her.
[12:06] When my own son doesn't give any importance to me.
[12:10] And as far as madam Zara is concerned.
[12:12] She will definitely incite. If not today then she will do that in future.
[12:16] But no problem, let her do that.
[12:20] Let me see, what does she get.
[12:23] It means that you won't stop Adeel from going to Karachi.
[12:27] Why would I do that? Why?
[12:31] He didn't talk to me so I won't talk to him as well.
[12:34] I am his mother, he is not my father.
[12:48] I am prescribing these pain killers.
[12:51] What's your name?
Zara.
[12:53] What?
Zara.
[13:07] I have prescribed some pain killers and you also have to conduct an x-ray.
[13:12] OK. Thank you doctor.
[13:28] Adeel.
[13:29] Will you call me from a nick name?
[13:32] Is that necessary?
[13:34] No, it's not.
[13:36] But we call each other with love with different names.
[13:43] So it means that if I won't chose any nickname for you then it means that I don't love you.
[13:48] I didn't say that.
[13:50] Do you know, a friend of mine has got married.
[13:53] Her husband calls her with so many nicknames with love.
[13:59] Oh I see.
[14:00] So it means that I will have to chose a nickname for you. OK, let me think.
[14:06] You can chose whatever you like.
[14:10] Zara.
[14:12] Do you know one thing?
[14:15] I don't understand this logic of nicknames.
[14:22] In my opinion, if you love someone then you love each and everything associated with that person.
[14:30] Everything and every action.
[14:36] Just like I love your name
[14:39] Zara.
[14:56] Yes.
[14:59] Yes, please send
[15:03] You know that she is so irritating these days.
[15:07] She is your elder sister and she has so many big problems.
[15:10] Don't take her words seriously.
[15:14] Do you know that what did she say to me?
[15:16] She said that Saad roams around in this house all the time.
[15:21] Should she have said that?
[15:23] No but...
I didn't complain against her.
[15:27] Then why is she lying.
[15:29] And she knows it very well that Saad doesn't come here only because of me
[15:33] Mom what if Saad knew about this then?
[15:36] But who will tell Saad?
[15:38] He won't know about that.
[15:40] And Saad is familiar to the environment of this house he comes here since his childhood and knows her nature very well.
[15:45] He won't mind.
[15:46] Just ignore as if nothing is happened.
[15:50] But mom, she talked to me like this.
[15:53] Why only me?
[15:57] Saad comes in this house since his childhood.
[15:59] If anyone feels bad that he comes here after engagement
[16:03] Then it's very obvious that question is being raised on my character.
[16:08] Mom, I can't tolerate such things from her.
[16:11] Please advise her in your own way.
[16:14] OK, I will do that.
[16:32] Greetings.
Greetings.
[16:42] As I told you that Zenny will mind this.
[16:46] So you see she mind it.
For God's sake, keep quiet.
[16:49] And don't say any such thing in there.
Come.
[17:00] Zenny.
[17:02] Zenny, come here. Let me show you my shopping items.
[17:07] Oh you are back. Show me.
[17:15] I have bought this for Adeel. How is this?
[17:18] Very nice color.
[17:19] It's very nice.
[17:23] By the way Zara, don't you think that aunt and Mahi won't feel good about it.
[17:31] But why will they feel bad Zenny?
[17:35] You are asking this question from me.
[17:39] Maybe you are right.
[17:42] But as you know that Adeel brings so many gifts for me.
[17:46] Look, the situation is different in boys' case.
[17:49] Their small things are not notable.
[17:52] But if you will send this gift then everyone will note this.
[17:56] By the way, I don't think that brother Adeel must have sent gifts to you by informing someone.
[18:01] If that was the case
[18:02] Then someone would have said anything.
[18:06] You maybe right. It is possible that no one may know this time as well.
[18:10] Is brother Adeel coming here alone?
Hmm
[18:13] Wow.
Zenny
[18:15] It's your favorite perfume.
For me.
[18:18] Aw, thank you so much. Do you know that my perfume was finished.
[18:24] I knew, that's why I have brought this for you.
[18:26] I came to your room in afternoon but you were sleeping.
[18:29] Thank you.
[18:30] You got so late in buying these few things.
[18:34] We got late because of Saad, he was so confused.
[18:37] He was confused and he was also confusing me.
[18:39] He was afraid in selecting everything.
[18:41] That whether Zenny will like it or not so we got late.
[18:46] That's good. He should be afraid.
[18:49] Because the scary time for girls is over now.
[18:53] You are absolutely right. OK, see this. I have bought this.
[19:07] Please come.
[19:09] Come here. Look at your son's shopping.
[19:13] Look at this. This dress is branded.
[19:17] The cost of this one dress is thirty nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine rupees.
[19:22] Oh my God, it's too expensive.
[19:26] So it cost forty thousand rupees, they mustn't have returned him one rupee.
[19:30] Do you think that he must have bought this from a local shop.
[19:32] Look at these things, the cost of these things are thousands of rupees.
[19:37] In my opinion, you should bring your daughter-in-law here.
[19:41] Their dowry must be ready.
[19:43] I don't understand, what is Adeel doing?
[19:47] Now tell me, will you talk to him or not?
[19:53] Where is he?
He has gone with groom for shopping.
[19:57] And I am sure that he will buy few more things to fill this bag.
[20:02] Do one thing, pick all these things and put in my room.
[20:08] No, let it here.
But why?
[20:11] He will take everything and give her as a gift.
[20:15] I will give all these things to his bride at the time of marriage.
[20:18] You are talking childishly.
[20:21] What do you think that if you will keep all these things with you then he will take this empty bag with him?
[20:26] He will buy again and will spend more money.
[20:29] I am telling you, talk to him very clearly.
[20:32] That he can't waste your hard earned money like this.
[20:35] And if he is so impatient then bring his bride immediately.
[20:39] Mom, please give me three thousand rupees.
[20:42] Why? Why do need that much money?
[20:44] Mom, I have to go to my friend's house for combined studies.
[20:48] She orders pizza and burgers for me everyday.
[20:51] So I want to order something for her tomorrow.
[20:54] You took four thousand rupees two days ago by saying this.
[20:59] Mom.
[21:01] What happened mom? Why are you scolding her?
[21:03] Don't express your anger with Adeel and Zara on her.
[21:06] She spends money unnecessarily.
[21:09] OK, go and take from my wallet. And not more than two thousand. Right?
[21:13] OK. Thanks.
[21:15] That's not right mom, you are humiliating her for two thousand rupees.
[21:18] But you don't say anything to him who is spending millions of rupees needlessly.
[21:23] Tell me, what will you say to him.
[21:26] Let me do some thing. He has become a slave.
[21:32] Let's see what will you do? You don't say anything to him.
[21:38] Where is Maheen? Why is she not eating?
[21:40] Her mood is off since afternoon.
[21:43] She said that she won't eat, she has a headache.
Thanks my child.
[21:50] You should talk to her in-laws.
[21:53] Rather you should talk to Usama, he will listen to you.
[21:55] Advise him that don't ruin his house.
[21:58] At least he shouldn't ruin our daughter's life. We are not habitual of such chaos.
[22:01] If I am not wrong Maheen's mother-in-law said the same thing about his son.
[22:07] That you should advise your daughter that don't ruin my son's life.
[22:11] But in my opinion, they not only have ruined their own lives rather they have ruined each others' lives.
[22:17] And now they have nothing left to be ruined.
[22:19] You are saying this about your daughter.
[22:22] So she should have listened to me at that time.
[22:24] I told her that this family is not right for you and your marriage won't last long.
[22:28] But no, she didn't listen to her dad.
[22:32] It's her fault and we are facing the consequences.
[22:35] So now you will take revenge from Maheen.
[22:37] Have you lost your mind? You say without thinking.
[22:41] Will I take revenge from my daughter for her mistake?
[22:45] She is my elder daughter. All three daughters are dearer to me more than my life.
[22:53] I can't even think anything bad about them.
[22:55] But you are not doing anything to correct her mistake.
[22:58] And to whom do I say, I can only talk to you.
Be patient. Hold on.
[23:03] We will proceed if they will say something.
[23:08] Give me water.
[23:14] Your husband was a contractor as well.
[23:17] So did you also became a contractor.
[23:21] He was not a contractor. He was a builder.
[23:25] He constructed the buildings but he couldn't build his own house.
[23:30] You have taunted me. Right?
[23:33] I will definitely taunt back.
[23:35] But at right time.
[23:43] What time will you leave tomorrow?
[23:46] Tomorrow.
[23:48] We will leave for Karachi at 3 PM.
[23:51] Hmm, and for how many days will you stay here after marriage?
[23:57] As long as my in-laws will bear me.
[24:00] It means that you will stay here for five days.
[24:03] What do you mean? Will you only bear me for five days only?
[24:06] You know, why I am saying this.
[24:09] And why are you saying this?
[24:10] Because it will 25th of this month after seven days.
[24:12] And that will be Saturday.
[24:14] You have to go to Islamabad to attend a seminar.
[24:17] You will stay here for five days. Will take rest on Friday and then leave for Islamabad.
[24:22] Oh yes, I forgot that I have to attend that seminar next week.
[24:26] But I remembered that.
[24:28] Tell me one thing.
[24:30] How do you remember every minor thing about me?
[24:33] In the same way as you remember about me.
[24:38] Well, listen
[24:40] You will attend my friend's wedding with me.
[24:43] I will ask from mom and dad.
[24:45] If they allowed me then I will definitely go with you.
[24:50] And what if they didn't allow you then?
[24:53] Then I will take your permission.
Permission?
[24:57] Which permission?
[24:59] If I am asking you then I want you to go with me.
[25:03] I mean to say
[25:05] If mom and dad didn't allow me.
[25:08] Then please allow me to refuse you.
[25:12] It means that you will take my permission to refuse me.
[25:16] And what if I didn't allow you then?
[25:18] I know that you won't do that.
[25:22] Really?
[25:24] So you have that much trust on me.
[25:25] I trust you a little bit less than your trust on me.
[25:31] Let me tell you one thing.
[25:33] You have become so talkative.
[25:37] Adeel, mom is calling you, let's go downstairs.
[25:42] Zara, mom is calling me, do you want to discuss anything important?
[25:45] No, we will talk later. Good bye.
[25:49] OK, good bye.
[25:51] Mom and dad want to say some important things. Come quickly.
[26:03] Why are you so worried for no reason?
He is not coming.
[26:07] He is talking to Zara on phone and said that he has to discuss something important.
[26:10] Please wait.
What?
[26:13] Has she become more important than mother.
[26:17] How do I know?
[26:18] He is behaving like this now then what will happen in the future?
[26:22] Did you see, Mr. Ahmed?
[26:24] Well, I don't see anything.
[26:27] When he will come then ask him about that important discussion.
[26:31] I won't ask anything.
[26:34] I am telling you Mr. Ahmed that I won't allow Adeel to go to Karachi. I am scared.
[26:41] I am so scared, my heart is pounding. I won't allow my son to go to Karachi.
[26:46] Mom, what happened? Why are you so worried?
[26:50] Adeel, listen to me.
[26:53] You will not go to Karachi.
[26:55] I won't let you go there. Promise me that you won't go there. Promise me.
[27:01] What do you mean by that? Why are you stopping me?
[27:05] Sister, what's the matter?
[27:07] Mom has dreamed that it's not good for you to go to Karachi.
[27:13] You have dreamed. I don't understand anything.
[27:16] My son, your mom has seen you drenched in blood.
[27:21] And she thinks that your Karachi visit will prove inauspicious for you.
[27:28] Now, tell us what will you do?
[27:31] Mom, that was just a dream.
[27:33] Why are you getting worried because of that dream. There is no such thing.
[27:36] What do you mean Adeel?
[27:38] You don't give any importance to mom's dreams.
[27:42] What are you talking about?
[27:43] What's wrong with it? Dreams are signals from nature.
Yes. Yes
[27:48] Yes, it is a signal. God gives such signals to mothers. God is very close to mothers.
[27:55] Mothers know, what is right and what is wrong for their children.
[27:59] I am telling you Adeel.
[28:02] You won't go to Karachi. I won't let you go there.
[28:05] Promise and swear on me.
[28:09] That you won't go to Karachi.
Mom, it's my friend's wedding.
[28:13] I must go there. All preparations have been done.
Yes, he is right.
[28:18] He has made so many preparations.
[28:21] And Zara must be waiting for him there as well.
[28:23] And if he won't go there then she will become angry and cry.
[28:27] Mother's tears have no worth in front of Zara's tears.
[28:29] What's wrong with you?
[28:31] Why do you keep saying such nonsense all the time?
[28:33] Keep yourself away from this matter.
[28:38] She is your elder sister and she is saying this because is she is concerned for you.
[28:43] Why don't you understand.
[28:45] You won't say a single word. Come here and sit with me.
[28:49] I won't let you go there.
[28:51] Adeel, I have seen a very bad dream so I won't let you go there. Swear on me.
[28:59] You won't go there.
OK, get relax.
[29:04] You made me worried.
[29:08] I won't let you go there.
[29:20] The same bogus stories.
I told you about this.
[29:24] We stopped watching because of this.
Tea is ready.
[29:26] Here is hot tea for all of you.
[29:29] Oh, Zara.
[29:30] You take so much time to make tea.
[29:33] Zenny, put this cup back. It's for dad, it's without sugar.
[29:38] It means that Zara takes so much time to make tea.
[29:42] You are in hurry to take tea.
[29:44] She wants to do everything in a hurry so you should marry her in a hurry as well.
[29:49] Are you taking revenge from me for making tea.
[29:52] Of course, because it was your turn today.
[29:54] Mom she is very lazy.
[29:58] You should have given tea to Maheen as well.
[30:01] I don't know what has Zenny said to her that she hasn't come out of her room since afternoon.
[30:04] Mom, I am sure that she must have put mask on her face, in fact Zara should have done that.
[30:12] I know that it won't make any difference for Mahi.
[30:15] Don't say such things. She takes your jokes seriously.
[30:20] She doesn't mind my words. Take care of yourself.
[30:23] She minds your words so be careful while talking to her.
[30:27] Right.
[30:31] Dad.
[30:33] Why did you change the channel. I was watching that serial.
[30:35] My scenes will be missed. Please.
[30:38] It's my choice.
[30:39] Mom did you see. Dad please.
[30:42] She was watching.
[30:44] Well the channel is changed now so I won't change again.
[30:46] OK, I won't talk to anyone.
OK, let me change this.
[30:51] Happy now? Take remote as well.
[30:53] This is useless fight. You always give her remote in the end.
[31:01] Thank God.
Mom.
[31:04] Mom, I am telling you. Something is going on between dad and Adeel.
[31:08] Let them do that.
[31:10] I won't let Adeel go to Karachi at all.
Your consent doesn't matter.
[31:16] I am telling you that he will go there.
[31:18] No matter what you do.
[31:20] Didn't you see that he didn't refuse once.
[31:24] This is happening because of your dad's support.
[31:27] It's his fault.
[31:30] Otherwise it's not difficult to control Adeel.
[31:34] Let me think.
[31:35] Now what will you do?
[31:38] He will go in the morning.
[31:40] Yes.
[31:43] I have a idea.
What?
[31:44] I should go with Adeel.
[31:47] Wow, wow, wow.
[31:49] One wasn't enough that the second one has come.
[31:51] I am stopping him to go there and you are ready to go there as well. Wow.
[31:56] What an idea.
[31:57] Well, if I will go with him then I will see that what is going on there.
[32:03] As if you don't know that what is going on there. Right?
[32:07] Their love story is going on there.
[32:10] And what will you do by going there.
[32:12] There is no need to go there.
[32:14] What I have to do, I will know that when I will reach there.
[32:19] Maybe, I can break this marriage.
[32:25] What do you mean by that?
[32:28] What are you thinking?
[32:32] What will you do?
I won't do anything.
[32:36] Everything will be done by Zara herself.
[32:39] It is said
[32:41] It's not a wise thing to dig a hole and push someone into that hole.
[32:46] Rather the wise thing is that whom we want to push into the hole, we force that person to dig that hole himself.
[32:53] I will do that.
[32:55] Let me go there, you will hear the good news.
[33:18] Hey, what are you doing?
[33:20] Can't you see that I have just cleaned the floor but you came in with dirty shoes.
[33:24] What happened? Wash my joggers as well.
[33:27] At least I will get some benefit of your day off from university.
Really?
[33:30] I cleaned the floor but you have messed everything.
[33:34] Behave yourself while talking to me.
[33:36] I am your future husband.
[33:37] You should respect me.
Oh really? I should respect you.
[33:41] Am I your future maid?
[33:45] Do you have any idea? So you will laugh now.
[33:49] I have been doing cleaning work since morning but you.
[33:53] You have made the mess.
Will you take my life now.
[33:58] Tell me, did you like my gifts?
[34:02] Very bad.
[34:07] But thank you so much.
It means you really liked those.
[34:12] You must have got an idea.
[34:14] That my choice is good for beautiful things other than you.
Wow.
[34:19] It is said that delusion can't be treated even by Hakeem Luqman.
Hey.
[34:24] Why are you mentioning such difficult names?
[34:27] Don't mention such difficult names, people will know about your real age.
[34:31] Then people will taunt me that I am marrying to an elderly girl.
[34:34] I think there is so much hot out here so
[34:38] So what about...
OK sorry, sorry.
[34:41] I won't leave you today.
[34:46] Oh.
[34:48] I am so sorry. Actually, I..
[34:50] No problem, you were throwing water on Saad but it came to me. I didn't mind it.
[34:55] There is no difference between Saad and me. Right?
[34:58] No. Even then, I am so sorry.
[35:01] I couldn't see you.
[35:03] No problem, why are you apologizing again and again? Has Saad gone to Zara?
[35:07] Do you want to meet dad?
[35:10] Actually, dad is not at home.
[35:11] But mom is at home so please meet her.
Water the plants.
[35:15] Yes.
[35:17] Thank you.
[35:39] Adeel, have you informed your in-laws that I am also coming with you?
[35:44] Yes, I informed them.
Didn't they say anything?
[35:49] Why would they say anything?
[35:52] I mean, they weren't expecting me.
[35:54] That's why I am asking.
[35:57] There is no such thing.
[36:00] No one said anything.
[36:02] What can they say by the way?
[36:04] They won't feel happy on my arrival.
[36:07] Actually, I think that they are not feeling happy on your arrival as well.
[36:10] That's why no one came to receive you.
[36:15] Everyone knew that I am coming with my friend's procession.
[36:18] And first I have to go to the bride's house.
[36:21] Even I didn't know that you will come with me and we will have to hire this cab.
[36:25] OK, don't favor your in-laws.
[36:29] You are son-in-law of that family.
[36:30] At least they should give this much protocol to their son-in-law.
[36:34] I didn't like this at all.
[36:36] Someone should have come to receive you.
[36:38] And you will go to their house.
Sister you know
[36:43] Brother Ali lives in Islamabad so how could he come to receive me.
[36:45] And would you like it if uncle would have come to receive me in this hot weather?
[36:49] At least Zara could come
[36:52] She could come with any of her friends rather she could come with her friend Saad.
[36:58] But no.
[37:00] Anyways, if you are not concerned then why do I say anything. Just leave it.
[37:36] Zara if you have finished your preparations then come quickly. Brother Adeel has arrived.
[37:42] OK, I am coming in couple of minutes.
[37:47] Hmm
[38:09] Zenny, Zara, come here, guests have arrived.
[38:16] Greetings.
My dear nephew.
[38:19] Greetings.
[38:21] Greetings. God bless you.
[38:23] Greetings aunt.
Greetings.
[38:25] How are you my dolly?
I am fine.
[38:29] He will bring your bags. Come in.
[38:34] You come in as well.
[38:45] How are you?
[38:47] I am fine. How about you?
[38:52] How was your journey?
[38:57] No matter how was the journey but the destination is very good.
[39:03] You are looking so beautiful.
[39:07] Thank you. Please come in.
[39:12] After you.
[39:18] Well, tell me about your journey. Was that comfortable?
[39:22] No uncle, we didn't face any problem. We have reached here very conveniently.
[39:26] Yes, Adeel is habitual of traveling and he was in a hurry to come here.
[39:32] Actually I am a bit tired because I don't travel that much.
[39:36] Yes it happens. First take tea then you can take rest.
[39:41] No aunt, I don't want to take tea.
[39:43] Take me to room, I want to take some rest.
[39:46] My child, Zara is making sandwiches, eat a few with tea then take rest.
[39:50] Just leave it. She is tired. Let her take rest.
[39:54] Zenny give her tea in room.
[39:57] She is also Maheen part two.
[40:01] Take her.
Let's go.
[40:02] Yes.
[40:07] What about your medical practice?
[40:09] By the grace of God, everything is alright.
[40:11] Do you save your patients or...
[40:13] What are you talking about?
Don't say that.
[40:18] God bless you and may God keep you save from evil sight.
I was just joking.
[40:25] Come here sister Maham.
Hmm.
[40:28] Tell me, are you going to university or left your studies like Zara.
[40:32] Zara didn't left her studies, she completed her masters.
[40:35] Oh I see.
[40:36] Do you know that everyone asks in Hyderabad that what is the field of study of doctor Adeel's wife.
[40:42] Since he is doctor then they think that his wife must also be a doctor.
[40:47] Your husband was a contractor as well.
[40:50] So did you also become a contractor?
[40:54] He was not a contractor, he was a builder.
[40:58] He used to build buildings but he couldn't build his own house.
[41:03] You have taunted me. Right?
[41:06] I will definitely taunt you back.
[41:08] But at the right time.
[41:11] I am so sorry. I didn't mean that.
[41:14] No problem. Where is my room?
This is your room.
[41:17] My luggage is outside, bring that in.
[41:18] I have put your luggage in the room.
Thank you.
[41:22] I am so sorry if you feel bad. I was just joking.
[41:29] Be careful while joking.
[41:33] Be careful while talking to me in future.
