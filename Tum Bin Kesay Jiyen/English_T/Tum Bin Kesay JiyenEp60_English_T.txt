[00:58] Dolly?
[01:01] Hello. Hello.
[01:04] See what I brought?
[01:10] What is all this, Ali?
[01:11] This is for our baby to come. I've also brought sweets for mom.
[01:15] But Ali, there's a lot of time left.
[01:17] If we start now, we'll be able to do something on time.
[01:21] Whats inside?
Clothes. Check.
[01:32] Ali, you've brought clothes for girls and boys too.
[01:36] Yes since the doctor said there was time for us to find the gender so I bought both.
[01:42] Don't you like them?
[01:43] They're very cute.
[01:46] There were so many other things but I couldn't understand.
[01:49] We'll go together for shopping now.
[01:54] Why are you smiling? Are you laughing at me?
[01:57] No... I'm proud of you.
[02:01] Do you know Ali, after dad died, I missed him everyday.
[02:09] But I never mentioned this to anyone
[02:12] but there wasn't even a single moment when I didn't miss dad.
[02:16] Ali I want our child to receive love from his mother and father.
[02:22] He should be complete with our love.
[02:26] This will happen by the will of God.
[02:29] Our child will receive love from his mother and father.
[02:34] Whether its a girl or a boy, we'll make no difference.
[02:38] Alright. What else have you got?
[03:10] Have you lost your mind, Mahi? Who gives jewelry on such occasions?
[03:15] I'll just give her five hundred rupees.
[03:19] I don't even have a five hundred note. I have thousands. Go and bring me change.
[03:25] Mom, you'll give this. We need to show off at times.
[03:31] Mom everybody should know that you've accepted Zara with an open heart and mind.
[03:36] Understand what I'm saying.
[04:03] So dear, this is what I'm saying. Maheen...
[04:10] What happened? Did Maheen do something again?
[04:15] What should I do about this girl?
[04:18] I'm tired of trying to explain her but she doesn't understand.
[04:22] Even I didn't like she left without meeting Dolly.
[04:26] Isn't it? You noted. She thinks everybody is her enemy and tries to show her down.
[04:33] But why?
[04:34] Why does she think that? Don't you ask her?
[04:37] Why won't I? I've asked and tried to explain many times. But she doesn't understand.
[04:43] You saw her. She didn't take sweets from Dolly.
[04:47] She said she was trying to taunt her that she didn't have a child after so many years of her marriage.
[04:55] I'm worried about Maheen. Why does she think so negative?
[05:00] since when its happening?
[05:01] Not today. She's been like this since forever. God knows what she has in that brain of hers.
[05:10] And now her mother in law is taunting her too.
[05:13] What? Why didn't you tell me earlier?
[05:17] She told me two days ago.
[05:20] You should talk to her mother in law.
[05:25] Children are written in our fate. She'll have them when its time.
[05:28] Usama and his mother should understand this.
[05:33] I'll talk to Usama.
[05:35] You cannot. Maheen has strictly told me not to talk to anyone.
[05:39] If we don't talk, how long will this go on for?
[05:42] God knows how long will this go on for? I'm just..
[05:46] I'm praying for my daughters.
[05:55] Did you see the news, Mahi?
[05:56] yes
[05:57] The inflation is risen. Petrol prices have sky rocketed.
[06:06] Work fast. I have to cook and send the food
[06:10] I'm working mom. Just give me two minutes.
[06:13] Hurry up please..
[06:24] Where are you going? Cut the vegetables..
[06:27] You didn't do good, Mahi.
[06:30] You didn't reach on the time I gave you. Now you've made an enemy out of me.
[06:35] You'll see the consequences of your mistake. Remember this.
[06:41] I will punish you severely for this mistake. You'll keep writhing in pain.
[07:09] Mom.. I've served breakfast. Come.
[07:13] Mom, I'm getting late. I'm going to the office.
[07:16] Zaini, come, have breakfast. I've made omelet for you.
I'm not hungry.
[07:21] Okay mom. Bye.
Bye dear.
[07:30] Don't worry, dear. She'll be fine. It will take some time.
[07:40] Its been a week mom.
[07:43] Zaini hasn't talked to me.
[07:47] She is very uncomfortable because I'm here.
[07:50] I don't like it mom..
[07:55] I'll go back.
[07:57] Its a wound on her heart, dear. It will take time to heal.
[08:02] You know how she is.
[08:04] She doesn't speak. She keeps everything to herself.
[08:09] Are you worried for Zaini?
[08:11] Yes.
[08:14] If there is someone to apply salve, the wounds heal quickly.
[08:19] I'm praying she finds someone too. Soon.
[08:30] Zara, get water for mom..
[08:34] Oh..
[08:37] Zara isn't here.
[08:41] If you're missing her so much. Why don't you bring her back?
[08:46] She's been there for many days now.
[08:49] She feels at home there, mom.
[08:54] When she doesn't want to come here, what right do I have to bring her here?
[08:58] Why are you talking like a child, Saad? You're her husband.
[09:04] You have a right to her. You can bring her back.
[09:14] Look at me.
[09:17] What is it? Are you hiding something from me?
[09:21] Nothing mom. I'll get you water.
Sit down.
[09:26] I want to talk to you. I don't want water. Tell me what is it?
[09:34] What are you hiding from me?
[09:36] Dear, you already lost so much by keeping things in your heart.
[09:44] Now again, don't repeat the same mistake.
[09:48] Tell me dear. What is between the two of you?
[09:53] Dear, the relationships that have been made, don't lose them now.
[09:59] What is it? Tell me.
[10:05] Mom, Zara wants to take a divorce.
[10:08] What?
[10:12] But why?
[10:13] Mom, she thinks whatever happened with me was wrong.
[10:17] Now, when everything is getting fixed, she wants me to leave her and marry Zaini.
[10:25] Dear.. Zara, why would she do this? How can she say this?
[10:33] This is the truth, mom.
[10:36] That's why she has gone home.
[10:39] She wants a chance to tell the truth.
[10:43] You hid such a big thing from me.
[10:48] How can you two take such a big decision?
[10:51] My consent isn't there mom.
[10:56] Zara wants it.
[11:01] Whats wrong with this girl? Why is she doing this?
[11:06] I'll get you water.
[11:13] What are you saying, mom? Is this why Zara is here?
[11:17] Ever since I've heard. I'm feeling sicker.
[11:22] Has she lost her mind? Is she crazy? What is she doing?
[11:27] I don't know myself. Ask brother Manzoor to talk to his daughter.
[11:32] What is this? She can marry or leave whenever she likes
[11:38] Mom, you shouldn't have let Zara come here.
[11:41] You know how much chaos this can create, mom.
[11:45] Ali can leave me..
[11:47] Leave you? How can he leave you? You're expecting his child.
[11:52] Mom, anything can happen. Please save my life, mom. Stop Zara from this stupidity.
[12:01] Dear, what can I do? Tell me.
[12:04] Make brother understand. What is he doing? Why is he doing all this?
[12:11] Tell Saad to take her back.
[12:13] How can he leave her? Marriage isn't a child's play.
[12:18] I'll talk to him. Don't you worry.
[12:22] Its not good to get angry in this condition.
[12:25] Mom, you don't understand. This cannot happen. You'll have to make Saad understand.
[12:30] How can he leave Zara? Its a marriage, not a game.
[12:34] Alright..
[12:36] Dolly?
[12:38] Who are you talking to?
Mom, I'll talk to you later.
[12:42] hello!
[12:50] Oh God.. What will happen now?
[12:54] I told her too. She didn't listen to me. But its alright. The class went well.
Mirha..
[13:06] I will not let you leave without listening to me.
[13:12] You'll have to hear me out.
[13:18] Please..
[13:22] Zara? What? Were you talking to Saad, dear?
[13:33] Why?
[13:37] I feel that ever since you're here, you haven't talked to Saad.
[13:43] Is everything alright between you two?
[13:50] Everything is fine, mom.
[13:52] He's very busy with his work.
[13:57] Are you telling the truth?
[14:51] Hello mom..
Hello.
[14:54] See what I brought?
[14:55] Oh my dear. So many things? What happened? Why did you spend so much?
[14:59] Hello.
Hello. Mom, I've been promoted.
[15:04] Really? Thank God. May God bless my son with a lot of success.
[15:09] Congratulations, dear.
Amen.
[15:12] Congratulations, Saad.
[15:14] Thank you.
[15:16] I'll have a little. Give the rest to Zara.
[15:22] Zara
[15:32] Mom.. I bought this for you.
[15:36] Really?
[15:37] My child.. my dear, my life..
This is for Ali and Dolly.
[15:41] Dear, why did you have to be so formal?
[15:45] And look at this. I brought this for Zara.
[15:51] For Zara? Show me.. Oh wow..
[15:58] This is beautiful Zara. Did you see? Its such a beautiful color.
[16:04] It will suit you.
[16:06] Saad, why did you have to get me this? I don't need new clothes.
[16:11] What do you do, dear?
[16:13] He brought this with so much love.
[16:15] Its alright mom. We'll give it to Dolly.
[16:34] Zara, whats wrong dear?
[16:37] He's your husband and he bought this for you with so much love. At least you could have kept his heart.
[16:42] You could have praised a little.
[16:45] Now see, his mood is spoilt.
Aunty, I didn't mean to hurt him.
[16:50] Dear, nobody hurts anyone willingly.
[16:54] He's your husband dear and its your duty to honor his likes and dislikes dear.
[17:01] See, dear..
[17:04] I spent my life all alone without my husband.
[17:08] But my God didn't leave me alone in this as well.
[17:12] My children were my support and that's why I couldn't even think about the storms I had in my life.
[17:18] I spent my life with my children. But dear, you're lucky.
[17:24] God has given you another chance as Saad.
[17:27] Don't lose the happiness you have in your husband. See, dear..
[17:32] If Saad is forgetting his past and taking a step towards you,
[17:36] you should also, forget your past and all the troubles,
[17:42] start afresh.
[17:45] Dear, life doesn't give you a chance again and again.
[17:49] Don't lose this chance, dear.
[18:54] Dolly, who were you talking to? Whose leaving whom?
[18:59] Ali.. actually..
[19:01] Dolly I'm asking you clearly and I want a clear answer.
[19:06] Who were you talking too?
[19:11] It was mom.
[19:15] Zara and Saad..
[19:17] Ali... There's nothing right between Zara and Saad.
[19:23] We need to talk to mom and dad.
[19:26] Don't take me wrong, Ali, but,
[19:30] someone should ask Zara why is she here since so many days?
[19:34] What do you mean by this? She's here for dad.
[19:38] She's not here for dad. Ali, Zara and Saad had an argument.
[19:47] Why is she here? They don't want to be together.
[19:51] What nonsense? Who told you this?
[19:54] Mom called, Ali.
[19:57] She was crying.
[20:00] She is already sick and after all this, she's suffering.
[20:06] You should ask Zara.
[20:10] I don't understand.
[20:13] You should talk to mom and dad.
[20:16] How can Saad do this? I'll talk to Zara...
[20:22] Zara..
Not right now, Ali.
[20:24] Zara? Zara?
Ali, let it be. You don't have to.
[20:26] Why are you shouting like this?
What is this new drama?
[20:31] What happened? Tell me.
[20:35] Saad wants to divorce her.
[20:37] Ask her, what she did now. Why have you both made our lives hell?
[20:44] She gets insulted at uncle's house, then she tests us and now she isn't at peace at Saad's house.
[20:51] Ask her. What does she want?
[20:59] What is Ali, saying?
[21:02] I was just asking you if everything is alright between the two of you and you said everything was alright.
[21:09] You lied to me, again.
[21:13] Again, Zara?
[21:16] What did you do?
[21:18] Why does Saad want to divorce you?
[21:21] I was about to tell you, mom.
[21:24] What? What were you about to tell me?
[21:26] Brother, I wanted to tell everyone.
[21:30] Go away from our lives. Let us be. What do you want?
[21:36] I get one happy news and then you land in between that as well. What do you want?
[21:42] And this.. Dolly.. She's my wife. I love her and I want to live with her.
[21:48] If what you want, happens, this relationship will also end.
[21:53] Brother...
[21:54] And I don't want my child to be brought up in such an environment
[21:58] It would be better if I just kill myself. I'll be rid of you.
[22:04] what's wrong with you, brother?
God forbid.. Whats wrong dear?
[22:08] Brother, you don't have to destroy your life or your relationship because of me.
[22:15] My decision will not affect your relationship
[22:19] And what happened to you, Zara?
[22:22] How can you accept such a ridiculous thing, Saad said? What happened between the two of you? Tell me.
[22:28] Nothing happened, mom. Nothing at all.
[22:31] And its not even Saad's fault.
[22:35] Its my decision to leave Saad.
[22:38] I don't want to live with Saad. I want to go far away from his life.
[23:21] I don't accept this.
[23:24] Mahi told me everything Aquib. You committed the robbery in our house.
[23:31] And you lied to love me because you wanted money.
[23:37] Tell me now, is this the truth?
[23:39] And you're here again because you want more money.
[23:43] And you'll blackmail me now?
[23:44] If I wanted to blackmail you, I wouldn't have come in front of you.
[23:50] I also have your new number.
[23:51] In fact, I also know whats going on in your house.
[23:56] I don't want to blackmail you.
[24:02] Then why are you here?
[24:04] To apologize to you.
[24:07] Apologize? Liar.
[24:09] Whatever you did, you want me to forgive you so easily for this?
[24:13] You destroyed my sister in law's life, Aquib.
[24:17] Do you even realize what you did?
[24:21] I know how wrong I did, Mirha. And I'm regretting it even today.
[24:27] But I accused your sister in law because your sister forced me to do all this.
[24:36] What else could I have done? Tell me.
[24:39] If I hadn't done that, I'd have been in jail today and my life would have been destroyed.
[24:45] I did whatever I thought was right back then.
[24:49] I know I wronged you and your family.
[24:55] Please give me a chance to rectify my mistake. Please Mirha.
[25:02] What will you go by all this?
[25:04] Peace.
[25:06] Staying away from you made me realize that I loved you.
[25:12] I hate your face, Aquib.
[25:17] Mirha, give me a chance, please.
[25:20] You don't deserve to be forgiven, Aquib.
[25:23] You destroyed my and my sister in law's life.
[25:27] You should now burn in the fire we burnt it.
[25:42] Why? Why do you want a divorce from Saad?
[25:46] What drama are you two creating now?
[25:50] Because he doesn't love me mom. And neither do I love him.
[25:55] He loves Zaini. I was forced in his life.
[26:00] Both of us don't love each other, mom.
[26:05] What do you want to show doing all this?
[26:08] That you're great?
[26:11] No Zaini. I don't want anything.
[26:14] Your happiness means a lot to me. I want to see you happy.
[26:19] For God's sake, stop with your drama.
[26:22] I don't want the love you're giving me in charity.
[26:25] That love was always rightfully yours Zaini. I was never even a part of this story.
[26:33] You got away from Saad because of your own insecurity.
[26:37] I'll tell you. Don't repeat the mistakes you've already made.
[26:44] Give yourself a chance. Give Saad a chance.
[26:49] You said you wanted this.
[26:53] But does Saad want this as well?
[26:57] Tell me.
[27:00] Saad wants the same thing, mom.
[27:04] He still loves Zaini.
[27:36] No mom. I don't want anything like this.
[27:38] Then go and bring Zara back, dear.
[27:42] She won't listen mom. She's very stubborn.
[27:46] She'll do what she decides.
[27:48] Dear, this will only bring destruction.
[27:51] You will not be happy yourself or keep anybody else happy.
[27:56] I had compromised with my life, mom.
[28:01] And I was happy with this compromise.
[28:04] I saw Zara was happy too.
[28:07] It could be a lie too.
[28:09] Dear, you both will break your home because you're being stubborn.
[28:15] Mom, a house with weak foundations will fall shortly.
[28:23] Saad..
[28:25] Saad, my child, try once. Save your home from fall apart.
[28:34] Don't make deals that will give you a loss.
[28:38] I've had dinner mom.
[28:49] Does Saad want the same thing? Tell me.
[28:55] Saad wants the same thing, mom. 
[28:59] He still loves Zaini.
[29:35] How dare she? 
[29:37] She dared to cut my call?
[29:42] Now you'll see what I do with you..
[30:03] Who...
[30:05] What happened Mahi? Why are you scared?
[30:09] I'm not scared mom. Why would I be scared?
[30:12] What else? 
[30:14] There is something. Will you not tell your mother?
[30:19] Tell me at least. What did you do now? 
[30:24] Will you hide it from me as well?
[30:26] Is it about Zara?
[30:28] Whats wrong with you? Why do you think I'm always thinking about Zara?
[30:32] So am I lying? This happens always.
[30:36] Its not like that mom. I have a headache.
[30:40] Come on, I'll take you to the doctor.
[30:42] I don't want to go mom. Let me rest for a while.
[30:48] Wow.. she's amazing.
[32:41] What happened Manzoor? Why are you sitting like this? Why aren't you sleeping?
[32:47] I'm not sleepy. I feel restless.
[32:52] Even I don't understand anything. 
[32:56] What should I tell Zara? 
[32:59] Should I support her or should I send her back home?
[33:03] If Zara goes back to Saad, will everything settle down? 
[33:08] What about the distances between the two?
[33:12] I don't know. I've felt both of them aren't happy together. 
[33:17] That's why Zara has decided to leave him.
[33:19] I don't think all this is right.
[33:22] You should talk to Zara. 
[33:25] Its not something ordinary to make or break relationships.
[33:30] You should talk to Saad.
[33:32] I think Zaini and Saad should talk.
[33:38] If Saad agrees to all this, I won't have an issue. 
[33:41] But first Saad and Zaini should talk at least.
[33:45] So you should talk to Saad
[33:50] Yes.
[33:53] Who is calling so late at night?
[33:57] Its Maheen.
[33:59] Oh God.. have mercy.
[34:03] Yes, Maheen? What is it, dear? Is everything alright?
[34:07] Alright. Tomorrow? What time? Alright. Bye.
[34:15] What did she say?
She wants me to go to the clinic with her.
[34:20] You should go. God will make everything alright. I'll try and sleep.
[34:38] Wow. Zara you're amazing. You've decided to leave Saad. 
[34:45] You'll come back in this house again, in my reach.
[34:53] And nobody can do me any harm. 
[34:56] Neither your husband Saad nor anybody else.
[35:01] You'll now realize how merciful fate is for me. And you..
[35:12] Poor Saad.. he couldn't have Zaini nor Zara.
[35:18]  But you don't worry. I have a lot to show you.
[35:24]  A lot.
[35:39] Yes, Inspector, how did you call me?
[35:41] Saad, I wanted to give you an important news.
[35:44] Yes tell me?
[35:45] The person you were looking for has been spotted in this area and we'll nab him soon enough.
[35:51] Thank you so much sir. Its very important to catch him. 
[35:56] I want to prove someone is innocent.
[35:58] I want to erase the stains on someone's character.
[36:00] Don't worry. We'll arrest him soon and give him a harsh sentence.
[36:05] Thank you so much sir.
[36:19] I'd tell you to think about it once more. 
[36:24] Its not right, whatever you want to do.
[36:29] So what is right for you, mom?
[36:33]  Is whatever happening, right? Normal?
[36:40] See dear..
[36:43]  Its not only you two in this relationship. 
[36:48] There are a lot of people in this relationship.
[36:52] Their lives, their happiness and their emotion are attached to this.
[36:58]  Think about them as well.
[37:00] Emotions!
[37:03] I made the wrong decision because I was emotional.
[37:07] It wasn't your decision only. Our consent was with you.
[37:14] I agree dear, we still don't know what was right and wrong at that time.
[37:21]  But if you want to do this to prove yourself innocent, don't do it.
[37:28]  You'll be left empty handed.
[37:32] Accept it as God decision for you. 
[37:38] Bury the past.
[37:41] My hands are empty of your and dad's trust, mom. 
[37:49] And whatever I have left,
[37:53] that is a mud house. 
[37:55] It can topple anytime if it faces a storm.
[38:04] Its better if I change my home
[38:10] Don't be so hopeless.
[38:13]  You're thinking wrong.
[38:16] Absolutely wrong.
[38:20] For your and dad's trust, for Zaini's happiness.. no matter what I have to do..
[38:29] I'll do it. 
[38:33] And this time it will be my decision.
[38:44] I will decide myself now.
[39:00] Oh wow... I get to see you everyday..
[39:08] If only my desire doesn't end
[39:11] Move out of my way.
[39:12] I won't. 
[39:14] You haven't changed one bit. You still haven't changed your habit of saying no.
[39:20] If you say another word, you'll see the worse of me.
[39:26] Adnan, uncle.. you here..
[39:29] I was going out for some work and I thought I'd ask your mother in law if she needs something.
[39:34] Mom is in the lawn. Go there and ask.
[39:40] Please come inside, I have to discuss something important with you.
[39:43] Go. I'll meet her in the lawn.
[39:53] Why is everyone so down? Why am I not?
[40:03] What is it, Dolly?
[40:06] Zara, don't mind what I said. I would have gone to mom's house but,
[40:13] you know the doctor has asked me to rest. Even if I go, I won't be able to look after mom.
[40:20] How can I go there, Dolly?
[40:22] Why can't you go? Its your house, Zara.
[40:26] Which relation should I go back with?
[40:29] What do you mean Zara? You're the daughter in law of that house.
[40:34] You have decided that you don't want to live there. But none of us.
[40:39]  Even I don't want it Zara.
I've decided Dolly.
[40:44] And I'll not step back.
[40:45] You'll have to step back. 
[40:49] You'll have to listen to me for the sake of the peace of this house.
[40:53] Zara, Ali's condition because of you. You know it. 
[40:59] What else do you want?
[41:01] I'm afraid Zara. Your hasty decision will put us all in a loss. 
[41:08] Please go back to mom's house, Zara.
[41:11] It is best for mine and Ali's relationship.
[41:14] What are you saying, Dolly?
[41:16] I'm saying whatever nobody will say to you here. 
[41:20] Decide whatever you want to decide with Saad together but leave from here right now.
[41:26] I cannot see Ali worried because of you, anymore.
