[00:12] Zara might have a hand in making you a part of my life..
[00:17] but you're the one who made her place in my heart, Zaini
[00:22] dad, you don't know what's going on in this house
[00:26] What do you mean? I don't understand.
[00:30] dad, Maheen raised her hand on Dolly
[00:32] Without any reason
[00:37] If anyone from our extended family tells them that you are divorced, then?
[00:44] No one is that bold.
[00:46] Just ask Zara to keep her mouth shut.
[01:08] hey, what are you doing here all alone?
[01:11] dad, you are here! Do you want something?
[01:15] I came to talk to you
[01:17] so, you could have called me
[01:20] can't I come to meet my daughter?
[01:23] No, its not like that
[01:26] I know, you are worried
[01:28] but why are you upset with food? Why you didn't had your food?
[01:32] I wasn't hungry
[01:34] nobody is hungry though
[01:36] neither your mom ate, nor I. We couldn't swallow anything
[01:42] dad... don't you worry. If God wills, everything will be fine
[01:48] you are worried, yet you are consoling me
[01:53] these are the qualities of daughters
[01:56] they can't see their parents in pain
[02:01] but dear, some children are parents trial
[02:07] dad...
[02:08] I've decided something, that's why I am here to discuss it with you
[02:12] yes
[02:13] but before making any decision, I want to know your point of view
[02:19] you heard Ali, that what does he want
[02:23] but I want to fulfill your responsibility along with it
[02:30] today, sister had expressed her desire that whenever Ali gets married. Dolly shall also get married
[02:38] so that someone shall be present in her house to take care of her
[02:42] if you think that all of this is right, then I will fulfill my duty for you as well
[02:52] yes..
[02:53] I know you haven't completed your studies as of yet
[02:57] but dear, that house is also like our house
[03:00] I don't think so that there would be any problem over there with your studies
[03:04] what do you say?
[03:08] dad, whatever you & mom decides
[03:12] your consent...
[03:14] I have always made my daughters life's decisions with their consent
[03:20] you also have the complete right to make your life's decision
[03:26] dad, I don't have any objection
[03:32] sure?
[03:39] always stay blessed
[04:03] it feels so good that you guys have visited us
[04:04] if I would have known prior then I would have asked Saad to stay over
[04:09] sister, the motive behind coming here is that we need to discuss an important matter
[04:13] yes brother, go ahead
[04:15] sister, I have come up with a request
[04:19] I've come to request you to do the marriage of Ali with Dolly and Saad with Zaini
[04:26] brother, what are you saying?
[04:29] its been only a few days of Adeel's demise
[04:33] I mean...
[04:36] you are absolutely correct, sister
[04:39] I've thought quite a lot about it & I've come to a conclusion that every work is destined on its time
[04:45] and I think now its the right time for these weddings
[04:50] but brother, it doesn't feel appropriate to take this step all of a sudden
[04:55] what's the matter, have we made any mistake?
[04:58] hey! no no, you haven't made any mistake Asfa
[05:04] actually, our daughter made a mistake
[05:14] what do you mean?
[05:16] Dolly, Maheen shouldn't have done whatever she did with you. I am so ashamed of it
[05:26] what Maheen did, what happened brother?
[05:30] the matter is that, Maheen tried to raise her hand on Dolly
[05:39] really? but Dolly didn't told me any such thing
[05:46] actually mom..
[05:49] I thought, if I will discuss this matter then it will become an issue for no reason
[05:53] that's why I stayed quiet
[05:58] dear, you didn't complain in the fear of this matter becoming an issue
[06:02] so that our head doesn't bend down because of shame
[06:06] such daughters are the reason of pride for their parents
[06:11] and here I am an unfortunate father, who is sitting ashamed in front of you people because of my daughter
[06:18] what are you saying? You are my elder, just like my father. Please don't say these things
[06:25] dear, I know you consider me in your father's place
[06:29] also you consider me as your father
[06:32] but the way you are treated in my house by Maheen, that I cannot tolerate
[06:39] neither I will allow this mistreatment to be carry forward
[06:47] that's why I've brought Maheen over here along with me
[06:50] Maheen
[06:52] you have to apologize to Dolly
[06:56] no no, there is no need of it. I don't have any complaint with sister Maheen. She is my elder
[07:04] No problem
[07:07] yes brother, Dolly is absolutely correct
[07:11] its ok, such petty matters do happen & we apologize to strangers. Not with our loved ones
[07:17] they are kids, today they will fight & soon they'll mend their relations with each other
[07:24] no sister
[07:26] Maheen will apologize to Dolly
Come on, apologize!
[07:35] Maheen
[07:39] didn't you hear, what he is saying?
[07:41] apologize to Dolly
[07:57] I'm sorry
[08:05] its ok
[08:32] Mirha has gone to meet that boy again today.
[08:35] Did Mirha tell you?
[08:37]  Why would she?
[08:39] She's not my friend, she's your friend. 
I'm sure she told you.
[09:03] I've announced my decision to everyone.
I can't live without Aqib and...
[09:08]  I can't even think about leaving him
[09:10]  Mirha please...
Sister please!
[09:12] If you can't do anything about me, then no need to interfere in my business.
[09:17] Mirha
[09:29] Why doesn't she meet him herself?
[09:31] It's her sister's issue she should resolve it herself.
[09:33] why is she involving you?
[09:54] what's done is done Asfa, but we assure you that Dolly won't face any issue in our house
[10:01] I know sister, that you will take very good care of my daughter
[10:05] what's done is done, leave this topic
[10:09] I request you to please agree with my words
[10:12] I am understanding it brother, but how will do so many arrangements in such a short time?
[10:20] everything will be done, but just say "yes"
[10:23] but Zara, what will her in-laws say?
[10:28] even we got the same thought in our minds for the very first time
[10:31] but see, whatever is done by God is better
[10:34] brother Ahmed is marrying his daughter this Friday
[10:38] and we got the courage by listening to it, that if he can hide his grief for the sake of his children
[10:45] so we should also keep our children happiness on first priority
[10:49] as far as Zara is concerned, then you know her
[10:55] we are sure that she will understand our point
[10:59] she won't have any problem
[11:03] sister, Sarwat is absolutely correct
[11:07] try talking in your house, I'm sure that nobody will have an objection
[11:12] our duty will be fulfilled as well if both the children wedding will be done together
[11:16] ok brother, if you people think this way then I will speak to Saad
[11:21] thank you so much!
[11:25] you guys haven't eaten anything. Dear, serve them
yes
[11:36] Zaini, did you see how I was insulted?
[11:39] yes, so your antic was as such
[11:43] what are you trying to say, Zaini?
[11:45] means, the way I was insulted was right & I am wrong
[11:49] am I capable of being insulted?
[11:54] you shouldn't have done this, I will just say this
[11:57] I am understanding everything, Zaini
[11:59] since your wedding discussions are happening, you don't care about anyone
[12:04] the way I am insulted in front of everyone
[12:07] the same way when you'll be insulted then I will ask you, that how does it feel
[12:17] if Dolly had any such intention then she hadn't been quiet as of yet
[12:22] you are so naive Zaini, but I am understanding everything
[12:26] She did all this to humiliate me in front of all, so that I shall stay ashamed in front of her for lifetime
[12:31] but I will also see, that how come she'll stay happy after coming here
[12:36] what's your problem? Why are you after her?
[12:41] do you have an idea, that your antics can ruin my marriage as well
[12:45] what are you saying to me, Zaini?
[12:48] yes, so stop it now!
[12:51] you are so selfish! You don't care about anyone, since your wedding discussions are going on
[12:56] you don't even care that Zara cannot come over there
[12:59] Why? What issue she will have?
[13:02] mom had told me, sister Mahi's marriage got fixed. And she is getting married on this Friday
[13:07] when a wedding can happen over there, then why can't we do the marriage & reception here?
[13:11] you have gone mad! Who will marry her?
[13:14] this is what you think! because both of you are jealous of each others happiness since childhood
[13:19] and now you are being jealous of Dolly's happiness too, however you shouldn't be doing it
[13:24] but you have become habitual of showing your animosity with everyone
[13:29] in what way you are talking to me, Zaini?
[13:32] this is the truth!
[13:33] I don't envy them, I am way much better than them in every aspect
[13:37] in fact, they are jealous of me. Also, both of them are same
[13:41] the only difference is that Mahi stabs you on the front, and Dolly stabs you on the back
[13:45] but both of them have the same nature, Zaini
[13:48] then leave them both on their own! Stay in peace & let us stay in peace as well
[13:53] so much of negativity is not good
[13:56] ok listen! Who is the guy?
[14:02] yours & Zara's senior professor Sir Alam, who used to come to our house as well
[14:08] to teach you accounts
[14:11] he is his nephew
[14:12] and yes! Sir Alam's daughter was your friend as well right?
[14:22] what is this happening?
[14:24] I am getting one bad news after another
[15:20] Look, how beautiful this dress is
[15:23] yes, this one is also very nice
[15:26] let me hear the call, ok?
[15:30] okay
[15:38] hello! Mr. Alam we have just reached
[15:42] we'll take almost 3 hours, and I have to buy the jewelry as well
[15:47] that's why I had asked you to come along, but you didn't come
[15:51] Mr. Alam, this is the last wedding of our family & I don't want anyone to say anything
[15:57] Zaviyar isn't our nephew but our son, you'll see how his wedding procession will be done with so much of pageantry
[16:04] ok fine, you also take very good care of yourself. 
We'll come soon. Bye!
[16:13] yes, did you like something?
[16:28] hey come in Zara
[16:33] aunty, I want to discuss something with you
[16:36] yes yes, you can discuss it. Bit first, sit down
[16:40] look at this
[16:42] and this too, your uncle & I have bought it for Zaviyar. We'll give him as a wedding gift
[16:47] its good, right?
[16:49] yes...
and look at this
[16:51] this set, I will give it to Mahi
[16:54] your granny had gifted me upon Mahi's birth, they are good right?
[16:58] they are very nice but aunty, I want to discuss an important matter
[17:02] yes yes, go ahead. Tell me
[17:04] actually I didn't wanted to hide it from you, but I couldn't gather the courage to tell you
[17:11] and now I feel that, if I won't tell you now then it will be too late
[17:15] oh God! my heart is sinking. What happened?
[17:19] what if Mahi has refused for the marriage?
[17:22] no no aunty, the matter is not about Mahi
[17:25] then? about whom it is?
[17:27] its about Mirha
[17:29] about Mirha?
[17:30] Mirha likes someone
[17:33] She has met that guy a few times, also that guy had visited our house a few times
[17:39] aunty, I didn't wanted to hide it from you but Mirha had forbidden me
[17:43] and I just want you to know about Mirha's choice
[17:51] mom, here you go. Sister Mahi has prepared tea for both of you
[17:56] be careful
[18:00] aunty!
[18:02] Maheen
[18:05] you are sitting here? What's the matter, Usama is here to pick you
[18:08] mom, whatever you guys are doing is not right
[18:15] has anyone asked you?
[18:17] No, right?
then what's the issue?
[18:20] since you haven't asked me that's why I am explaining you. What if nobody asks from you in the future
[18:26] and the way you people have become blind in your son's love, what if he doesn't looks back at you in the future
[18:32] you are so stubborn, Maheen. Your mindset is still the same
[18:37] Fine!
[18:39] I accept that I am quite stubborn
[18:42] but what about you guys? You are sensible, think wisely
[18:47] act sensibly
[18:50] I had told you Maheen, that your father is the decision maker of this family
[18:57] he is still alive, this decision is of your father & we have no objection on it
[19:02] yes! why will you have an objection mom? As Dolly is your dearest
[19:08] Ok enough, be quiet & get ready to go back
[19:11] does Zara knows whatever is happening here?
[19:14] No! and there is no need to tell her
[19:17] I will tell her myself on the right time, and there is no need for you to call her as well. Got it?
[19:23] what kind of a mother you are! you don't care a bit about me?
[19:27] You had asked me to apologize to Dolly & now you are angry with me
[19:31] yes, its evident to be angry on the person who will make the mistake
[19:35] come on now, that poor guy has been waiting since so long
[19:54] shameless, whom do you like?
[19:57] who m do you love? Who is he!
[19:58] mom...
aunty, please leave Mirha. At least, listen to her once
[20:03] she has ruined our honor! Is this how she will repay our love for her?
[20:08] mom I...
don't you dare to utter a single word from your mouth, I will pull out your tongue!
[20:14] got it?
[20:15] mom, listen to me..
Quiet! I said, not a single word from your mouth
[20:23] if you'll talk to that guy ever again, then nobody will be as bad as me
[20:29] Zara, today onwards she won't go to the college!
[20:33] She won't go outside as well!
[20:35] no mom no...
Quiet! Quiet, I said
[20:38] not a single word!
[20:41] get lost from here
[20:44] Zara, take her away from here else I will kill her!
take her away!
[20:49] come with me, Mirha
[20:54] Mirha... Mirha, please listen to me
[21:31] wow man! you did a great job in today's meeting
[21:35] boss is quite impressed from you
[21:37] I just hope that soon I get an approval from there
[21:40] don't take tension, you'll get an approval. It takes almost a week's time
[21:44] come, lets drink coffee
[21:46] No man, I will go home as my mother must be waiting
[21:49] its just a matter of one day & today is your first day
[21:53] just consider it as a treat from my side
[21:55] you can give me a treat once you'll get an approval.
Come on
[21:59] you can take the treat now, as you won't be able to wait for a week's time
[22:03] ok come, lets go. Hurry up
[22:05] ok, one minute
[24:00] what happened brother? Did you met any relative?
[24:02] No, I was just looking like that
[24:05] come, lets drink coffee then
[24:46] take it, wipe off your tears
[24:48] why you've come here?
 go away
[24:55] mom has told me everything
[24:58] what happened with you?
[25:01] when you already knew everything, then why did you ask me to make sister Zara my secret keeper?
[25:08] did you see, what had happened now?
[25:11] at least stop crying
[25:13] will everything be fine by crying?
[25:16] Mirha look, honestly speaking. This had to happen one day or the other
[25:22] what do you think, can Zara stay quiet?
[25:25] She just wanted a chance to ruin the happiness of our family
[25:29] what do you mean?
[25:32] Zara was never happy with yours & Aqib's relationship
[25:36] have you forgotten, how she had stopped you? She was stopping you again & again
[25:41] and I was quiet being your sister, although I was aware of everything
[25:48] you were thinking that Zara is your sister
[25:52] Zara was being so close to you, but she is just like her sisters
[25:58] so when you already knew everything, then why did you ask me to tell everything to Zara?
[26:02] because I wanted to expose her fake innocence in front of you all
[26:08] I wanted to bring her reality in front of you all
[26:12] I hate her
[26:14] I don't want her to stay in this house
[26:17] she ate away the happiness of our house
[26:20] she ate away our brother, Mirha
[26:24] I can never forgive her
[26:29] and you...
[26:31] I will take the revenge of your insult
[26:37] tell me
[26:39] do you want to take revenge from Zara?
[26:51] ok stop it, how much more you'll cry?
[26:54] do you want to make the shrine of your love by crying again & again?
[26:59] stop it, its ok. It happens
[27:27] mom, how is this possible?
[27:29] wedding & that too this month?
[27:31] dear, try to understand the matter
[27:34] brother Manzoor came with a lot of expectations
[27:37] mom, recently I got a job & I have to settle down
[27:41] so what dear? You have to do the job for your entire life
[27:45] once you'll get married then God will make things much better with Zaini's fate
[27:50] mom, this is what you are saying
[27:52] but you know all
[27:54] I am not ready to take such a big responsibility right now
[27:58] and I don't understand, that what as such had happened that uncle has asked for the wedding all of a sudden
[28:06] Saad
[28:08] listen to me very carefully, dear
[28:13] actually the matter is that, Maheen & Dolly had a fight over a small matter
[28:23] it was a misunderstanding, Maheen got angry & she tried to slap Dolly
[28:30] because of that the matter got escalated
[28:32] now brother Manzoor
[28:35] mom, is Maheen crazy? Let me go & ask her right away
[28:38] stop it, sit down peacefully
[28:41] mom, she tried to slap my sister. How can I stay quiet on this?
[28:45] you have to Saad! you have to stay quiet
[28:49] because we are the girl's family
[28:50] mom, if we are girl's family then we are also the boy's family. What if I do the same with their daughter as well then?
[28:56] Enough! Enough Saad, nothing else now. This was the reason that I wasn't telling you anything
[29:02] dear, try to keep a control on your anger & listen to me with a cool mind
[29:08] brother Manzoor had brought Maheen along with him
[29:11] so that she can apologize
[29:13] what else do you want, dear?
What else shall he do?
[29:17] dear, we are the guy's family. Also they are the guy's family too
[29:21] but we cannot falsify their generosity
[29:24] Maheen got angry for some reason, and she did this
[29:29] but whatever you are doing in its revenge is also wrong
[29:35] brother Manzoor's demand isn't wrong
[29:38] and honestly speaking, even I want the same. I want this wedding to happen as soon as possible
[29:44] I won't listen to anything else, sit quietly & eat your dinner
[29:49] come on dear, come
[29:52] sit down
[29:54] sit
[29:57] start eating
[30:08] come on, eat your dinner
[30:30] what have I done, Adeel?
[30:32] I shouldn't have done this
[30:35] Mirha is angry with me, also aunt is upset with me
[30:40] what shall I do now?
[30:42] what shall I do, Adeel?
[30:51] Zara
[30:53] yes aunty?
[30:54] I've come to talk to you
yes
[30:58] whatever you've told me about Mirha
[31:03] don't mention this to your uncle
[31:06] he is very strict in nature
[31:09] if he gets to know about it, then he will be very strict with Mirha
[31:13] aunty, I didn't mean that at all
[31:16] I haven't told you all this in order to do her complain to you
[31:20] I am thinking good about her, I just want you to meet that guy once
[31:26] enough! its not possible
[31:29] there is a lot of difference in your house environment & in this house environment
[31:33] the way your family members are so independent, I cannot give that independence to the people of this house
[31:39] that's why it would be better for you to stay away from this matter
[31:42] what?
[31:44] and yes! I want to say one more thing to you
[31:51] your uncle has talked to Sarwat about Mahi's wedding
[31:56] if you want, you can also tell your mother
[31:59] but.. remember one thing
[32:03] none of this house matter shall be discussed in that house
[32:09] specially Zaviyar's family shouldn't get to know about Mahi's divorce, as we have hidden this matter from them
[32:18] what!
[32:19] yes
[32:21] this matter shouldn't reach to them at all, as it is such matters are of no use
[32:28] what's the use of discussing a matter which has become a part of the past, a relation which become a part of the past
[32:34] aunty, how can you keep the basis of a new relation on a lie?
[32:38] Enough! don't try to teach me philosophy
[32:42] whatever I am telling you, listen to it, understand it & work on it
[32:48] are you getting my point?
[32:53] this matter shouldn't go out of this house at any cost
[32:57] specially your uncle shouldn't get a hint that we've hidden this matter from Zaviyar's family
[33:07] if this matter went out of this house
[33:11] then do you know its consequences?
[33:19] Ali is calling, talk to him
[33:55] it was a misunderstanding, Maheen got angry 
[33:59] & she tried to slap Dolly
[34:02] because of that the matter got escalated
[34:56] Zara, at least pick up my call
[34:59] what shall I do? With whom I shall share all this?
[35:04] I cannot marry right now, how shall I explain it to everyone?
[35:10] I have to speak to Zaini
[35:31] brother, a lot had happened but nobody had told me anything at all
[35:38] what to tell you Zara, everyone is so worried here because of sister Maheen
[35:42]  but brother, mom had told me that Maheen has gone back to her house upon dad & brother Usama's orders
[35:48] and whatever Maheen did is so wrong, she shouldn't have done that
[35:53] now tell me, what shall I do in all this?
[35:56] what does dad say about it?
[35:59] dad has talked about our marriage over there
[36:01] ok listen..
[36:03] can you come?
[36:06] no brother...
[36:08] Zara look, I never wanted to make you worried
[36:12] but sister Maheen has not left any option
[36:15] I don't want to loose Dolly
[36:19] brother, whatever you did is absolutely correct
[36:23] Dolly is your responsibility, and you did a great job by taking stand for her
[36:28] thank God that you've understood my point, I thought that I might make you upset
[36:33] please don't think this way & start your wedding preparations
[36:38] Okay, bye!
[37:13] Zara might have a hand in making you a part of my life..
[37:19] but you're the one who made her place in my heart, Zaini
[37:30]  love shouldn't be restricted to oneself.
[37:34] Rather...
[37:37] it is something that is shared between two people..
[37:43] I love you Zaini.
[38:00] Thank you so much.
[38:03] You look beautiful
[38:31] this matter shouldn't reach to them at all, as it is such matters are of no use
[38:38] what's the use of discussing a matter which has become a part of the past, a relation which become a part of the past
[38:52] whatever I am telling you, listen to it, understand it & work on it
[38:57] are you getting my point?
[39:02] this matter shouldn't go out of this house at any cost
[39:07] specially your uncle shouldn't get a hint that we've hidden this matter from Zaviyar's family
[39:17] if this matter went out of this house
[39:20] then do you know its consequences?
