[00:21] How can you say that about me?
[00:23] I don't have a habit of keeping an eye on girls.
[00:26] also bad one
[00:28] The funny thing is that I keep an eye on people who have such a habit.
[00:34] You have no idea about this
[00:37] and it would be better if you stay far away from this.
[00:42] Stay away from Adnan,
[00:45] he is a vile man.
[00:48] Did your elder sister go on a honeymoon, or did your mother?
[00:52] Or did your uncle take me on a honeymoon?
[00:56] No one went, right? No one went from your family, so you guys won't go either.
[01:03] I'm telling your clearly that you should stop thinking about going to your honeymoon.
[01:17] Zara has made so many things.
[01:23] Greetings*
[01:33] Zara, if you make such tasty food everyday, I'll have to join Adeel in jogging everyday.
[01:42] That's good.
[01:44] You don't listen to me, but at least this way you'll start coming with me.
[01:49] It's not like something drastic will happen.
[01:52] I'm very happy with my daughters at home.
[01:56] I get to eat tasty food.
[01:59] Fareeda you have made the best decision of your life.
[02:07] What decision?
You've handed the responsibility of the kitchen to Zara.
[02:13] It's not like she's the first one.
[02:16] I took over the kitchen the moment I was married.
[02:22] It seems that you are feeling insecure because of Zara.
[02:27] What do you mean?
Nothing auntie, carry on with your breakfast.
[02:35] Father, that's not fair.
[02:39] Would she have allowed her to go inside the kitchen if she was insecure?
[02:42] She gave her this responsibility.
[02:46] Mahi, you don't need to provide any explanations.
[02:50] Don't you know how your father is? He doesn't think before speaking.
[02:57] He can't even distinguish between having fun and making fun of someone
[03:02] Alright fine. Forgive me... I won't joke around with you.
[03:07] Carry on with your breakfast.
[03:12] Father I want to talk with you alone.
[03:21] Sure... we'll talk after we have breakfast.
[03:26] I want to talk right now. Please head down with me.
[03:30] Lead the way.
[03:33] Zara, send the breakfast downstairs.
[03:50] What is it that he can't say in front of us.
[03:54] How do I know? Why do you make Zara seem to be so helpless in front of everyone?
[03:59] When did I make her to be helpless. Come on!
[04:04] Now eat... it's tasty.
[04:07] I can't swallow a morsel of it, it's horrible.
[04:11] I'll eat it later.
Hey!
[04:15] What's with you? My son earned it, and I'll be eating it.
[04:19] If that's the case then why are you saying that it's horrible.
[04:23] Shut up and eat!
[04:26] It's good, right?
[04:36] Tell me one thing, how many times will we watch this movie?
[04:39] What are you guys doing?
[04:42] You guys are watching a film?
Yes.
[04:45] It's Zara's favorite film.
It's a good movie.
[04:50] Why are you showing it at home?
[04:53] Take her outside for a dinner and a show.
[04:58] This is the time for you guys to have fun, you won't find time later.
[05:03] Indeed, I asked Zara, but she refused.
[05:07] Why did you refuse?
[05:10] I thought girls like going out.
[05:13] Uncle said that he was expecting some guests.
[05:15] And it was important for us to be at home. That's why I refused.
[05:21] Did your uncle say that?
[05:26] Oh yes! I almost forgot!
[05:31] We are expecting some guests.
[05:34] I completely forgot. So what if guests are coming?
[05:40] Why are you ruining your plans because of some guest? You guys may go
[05:44] Mother, we made no plans.
[05:50] I understand, but you guys should go. I'll take care of the guests.
[05:59] Uncle said that it was an old friend of his and he wanted me to meet them.
[06:05] We can plan for some other day.
[06:08] Yeah, we'll do it some other day.
[06:10] Alright. I was saying it because of you guys, I have nothing to gain from this.
[06:16] As you wish.
[06:19] I think she's upset.
[06:22] Should we go then?
[06:25] Her mood is good only once a year.
[06:27] No, we can't go today. Uncle said that it was important for us to stay home.
[06:32] I have to cook for the guests as well.
[06:36] We'll watch the movie later. Or you can watch it.
Sure.
[06:49] Nothing can be done. Everyone has their own little life going on.
[06:57] I told your father not to tell Zara about the proposal thing.
[07:02] But why won't he tell her? He will do everything I ask him not to do.
[07:11] Does that mean that they aren't going?
[07:14] Am I speaking a foreign language?
[07:19] Your father has told Zara everything.
[07:22] He has asked them not to leave home and that he will be introducing his friend to Zara.
[07:30] I told you that Zara shouldn't find out until my wedding is fixed.
[07:35] What if the proposal is rejected?
[07:37] God forbid! What are you saying? You speak whatever that comes to your mind.
[07:43] What won't they accept your proposal? They will accept it.
[07:49] You father has told her.
[07:52] Now I'll see how...
[07:56] Zara speaks about this. If she opens her mouth...
[08:02] you'll see what I'll do to her.
[08:05] There's no point in saying such things.
[08:08] Maheen will make fun of me if she finds out.
[08:12] When I went there she taunted me about my divorce.
[08:15] Who was stopping you?
[08:18] You should have asked why she has been living at her mother's house for so many days.
[08:24] There must be something that is going on.
[08:29] Otherwise her in-laws are lovely people.
She's not that lucky.
[08:35] If they were so loving then why would she be staying at home?
[08:40] Why are you concerned about her?
[08:43] Tell me, what should I do about this accursed Zara? Your father has ruined my mood.
[08:51] It would have been great if she had left home. I would have been at peace.
[08:57] Mother, I'm telling you right now.
[08:58] You should tell her that this shouldn't leave our home. It won't be good for her if it does.
[09:06] Alright, I'll tell her, don't ruin your mood. I'll talk to her.
[09:36] So...
[09:40] What have you decided?
[09:43] About what?
[09:46] You know very well what I'm talking about.
[09:48] Mother up till now, why don't you understand my opinion on the matter.
[09:55] You know that your in-laws will not listen to foolish demands.
[10:01] Still your mother asked me to ask your say on the matter.
[10:07] What should I tell him?
[10:08] Father asked for an answer. Deliver him my answer.
[10:13] Clearly tell him that I have refused.
[10:53] Shall we?
Listen.
[11:02] Zaini...
[11:05] What is it?
[11:09] I love you.
[11:19] You really are stupid.
[11:23] I shouldn't tell you anything.
[11:26] You've turned this into a joke.
[11:32] Shall we?
[11:35] Let's go.
[11:41] Come on.
[11:56] What is this? You're not ready yet?
[12:01] I'm not going anywhere.
What is this childish behavior Razia?
[12:04] We are already late.
[12:06] When you've settled everything alone...
[12:09] then what is the need for me to be there.
You'll have to come along...
[12:14] What doesn't Zaviar do for you and you...
[12:18] I love Zaviar as much as you do.
[12:22] That's why I want to marry an honorable girl from a wealthy family for him.
[12:26] Look Razia,
[12:29] only Zaviar has the right to make this decision. If because of some reason...
[12:37] if she dislikes the girl, then you can find another girl for him.
[12:43] But you will not say this in front of him.
But...
[12:48] Razia if you talk to him, I will change my mind about selling my property.
[12:57] That's not fair.
[13:00] If you act stubborn, then I can act the same to have my way.
[13:05] Uncle
[13:07] Come my dear... why aren't you ready yet?
[13:11] If auntie doesn't want us taking a proposal there...
[13:15] then we shouldn't go. Call and reject the proposal.
[13:18] What are you saying Zaviar?
[13:20] Uncle, I don't want to upset auntie.
[13:23] She never let me feel the absence of a mother.
[13:27] Please call them and reject the proposal.
[13:30] Do you hear him? This is the lengths he can go to...
[13:33] for you happiness and then there's you...
[13:40] Alright Zaviar my dear... I'm willing to go with you.
[13:44] If I don't like that girl we won't marry you to her.
[13:48] Done auntie.
It's settled then. You two get ready...
[13:53] We're already late. I'll wait for you two.
Alright uncle.
[14:00] Hurry up guys. I'm waiting.
[14:20] Zara.
Yes?
[14:23] What are you doing?
I'm preparing food like uncle asked me to.
[14:30] It's obvious that you have to take care of such things.
[14:34] For now stop what you're doing and listen to me.
[14:40] Sure.
[14:41] What did your uncle tell you about the guests?
[14:44] That they are coming here with a proposal.
[14:46] I'm sure you must have told that to your mother.
[14:52] Uncle asked me not to tel anyone until the proposal is finalized.
[14:56] Still you must have told her.
[15:00] I'm sure you must have asked her not to tell anyone.
[15:05] This is how things are leaked out from homes.
[15:09] That is what one does when they pass on a secret, ask the other person not to tell anyone.
[15:16] That does happen, but I'm not one of them. I wasn't raised that way.
[15:24] Don't worry, until Mahi's proposal is accepted I won't tell anyone.
[15:30] Should I use beef or chicken to make the kebabs?
[15:33] You can use my chopped liver for all I care.
[15:35] I feel that you want to. One more thing...
[15:43] you might be able to make Adeel and his father a fool but not me.
[16:11] Finally you are rid of this now and you're fine now.
[16:15] Brother, I'm completely fine, right?
[16:17] Yes you are, do you doubt it?
[16:21] No... after this I thought that I would never be able to walk properly.
[16:26] What's the matter with you? People get better after horrible tragedies...
[16:31] And this wasn't even that bad. You shouldn't worry like this.
[16:36] Now get up and walk for me.
[16:40] Get up.
[16:45] Do you want to walk like this for the rest of your life?
[16:48] Leave this and walk normally.
No brother I'm scared.
[16:53] What are you scared of? Show me your hand.
[16:57] Come on... you are walking normally. You're fine.
[17:08] She was scared that she wouldn't be able to walk normally, but she's fine now.
[17:18] Shall we go?
Let's go.
[17:28] Brother Imran it's good that you brought your wife with you.
Greetings.
[17:35] Greetings to you too.
Brother Noor, your wife looks amazing.
[17:44] Why does it seem to me that I've met you before.
[17:50] You have it wrong, we're meeting for the first time.
[17:56] First time?
[17:59] Yes sister... you are meeting her for the first time.
[18:03] Actually, after Rukhsana's death, she is the one that I married.
[18:12] By God's good grace you are very lucky,
[18:17] otherwise a widower doesn't find himself such a pretty wife at your age.
[18:33] Greetings*
Come Zara, Brother Noor Alam, this is my daughter-in-law.
[18:41] Sir, you're here!
Brother...
[18:45] you have found a wonderful match for your son. Zara...
[18:51] she was my best student. She was incredibly obedient.
[18:58] Uncle, he used to teach us math and was the entire class's favorite student.
[19:03] Really...
So, I was there favorite.
[19:09] But Zara was the college's favorite student.
[19:15] Apart from studying no one was her equal when it came to extracurricular activities.
[19:26] That's great, now that you are done getting praised.
[19:31] Prepare for some tea for your teacher.
Sure.
[19:37] Mr. Ahmed, it is a lovely coincidence...
[19:42] I have not one but two relationships with your family.
[19:49] I just didn't call Zara my daughter, but I treated her like one.
[19:58] Yes sure... I can see that.
[20:03] Tell us about your son, after all you've brought us his proposal.
[20:08] My lovely wife, tell them how are son is.
[20:13] Our son is a one in a million. You will never get the chance to complain.
[20:21] By God's good grace our son has his own businesses.
[20:31] I saw Mirha's accident. I saw her funeral. You can go another time.
[20:39] I saw her funeral, why don't you understand.
I will go,
[20:43] because I promised Zara.
[20:47] I will go at any cost, even if the worse comes down on me, even if I die!
[21:01] Adeel, why are you still sitting like this? You haven't changed as well.
[21:06] Everyone is waiting for you. You should be outside.
[21:10] It is important for me to be there.
[21:11] Yes it is, Mahi is your sister and you should be there.
[21:19] Do you know that one shouldn't sit at a place that one is invited to.
[21:25] Mother and Mahi didn't want us to be around that's why she wanted us to go outside.
[21:34] What difference does it make?
[21:36] I met her as well and you should come as well.
[21:39] It does make a difference.
[21:43] And I am very clear in this matter. We will be moving to the place that father gifted you.
[21:50] We're shifting there?
[21:52] I just told you that we shouldn't stay at a place where one isn't invited
[22:01] Look Zara, no matter how hard you try you won't be able to make a place here.
[22:10] This is not the time for such things.
[22:14] Noor Alam is my teacher and I want to introduce you to him.
[22:19] Please come with me and change.
[22:24] Please.
[22:28] Alright fine, but I'll only go because of you
[22:32] Okay fine... go ahead and change.
This is amazing!
[22:40] You didn't want to meet your sister's in-laws.
[22:44] But you are willing to meet your wife's teacher.
[22:49] Mahi was right when she said that Zara knows how to do magic.
[22:57] They are expected to be her in-laws. Nothing has been finalized yet.
[23:01] Why not? The way Noor Alam was happy to see her, it's her responsibility to make him agree to the proposal.
[23:14] He's my teacher, how can I convince him for the proposal?
Why not?
[23:21] I almost forgot that Mahi isn't your sister that you should try for.
[23:29] The way you tried for Saad and Zaini to get engaged.
[23:33] I heard that it was hard for you to convince Saad.
[23:38] Right?
It's not like that auntie.
[23:42] It might have not, but you have you to try in this matter.
[23:48] Because brother Alam knows you well otherwise we know them as a far off acquaintance.
[23:56] He turned out to be quite close to you. He's like your fan.
[24:04] Now it's your job to convince them for Mahi's proposal. If he tries to refuse...
[24:11] then don't let him, because you aren't uneducated like us.
[24:17] You know how to convince people.
[24:22] And one more thing, I don't want brother Noor Alam to accept Mahi's proposal,
[24:28] rather we want you to do it.
[24:30] I don't know how, but it's your job to convince him.
[24:35] Come outside quickly.
[24:42] It's such a big responsibility.
[24:44] Noor Alam is my teacher, how can I say something like that to him?
[24:53] That's why I wanted us to leave.
[24:59] As far as the  proposal is concerned, leave it to me.
[25:03] I'll take care of everything.
[25:08] Look at me.
[25:11] Trust me... I will never leave you alone.
[25:16] Never.
[25:22] I'll freshen up.
[25:38] Manzoor, I don't know why you ask me to talk to her. You know how she speaks to me,
[25:43] she has clearly refused.
[25:45] You are his mother, make her understand. Don't let her ruin her home.
[25:52] Because if I talk to her in a different way.
[25:55] I don't care if it will be in a different way, you'll have to talk to her.
[26:00] I am with you. She still listens to you, but she doesn't listen to me at all.
[26:10] Alright.
[26:13] Don't say anything to Maheen.
[26:20] Take your tea, it's getting cold.
[27:19] Hello Farah.
Hello Zaviar, how are you?
[27:23] I'm fit, what about you?
I'm fine as well.
[27:27] You tell me, I heard they are looking at proposals for you.
[27:30] Yes, uncle wants me to settle down now.
[27:33] You are the only one that is left in the family. You should have been married long before I was.
[27:38] Brother Ayaz was in a rush.
[27:40] He still reminds me that I was quite problematic when it came to getting married. 
[27:44] But I'm happy that you agreed to get married.
[27:49] But I would be at peace if you were here.
[27:52] I will my try my best, but first finalize the girl.
[27:56] That's true.
Tell me one thing, the place you went to today...
[28:02] How did you like them? They are old acquaintances.
They were okay.
[28:07] What about the girl?
[28:09] I don't know.
What do you mean? Didn't you meet her?
[28:13] I saw her, but I was unable to talk to her.
[28:15] Their culture is a little different.
[28:18] But I will ask mom and dad to introduce you to him so it's easier for you to decide.
[28:26] You are quick to such solutions.
[28:29] You only make a better decision once you talk to her.
[28:32] Alright, there are other things that one must look at.
[28:36] Let's see what happens.
Can I come to meet you Aqib?
[28:40] My leg is fine now.
Congratulations. That's great news.
[28:46] When are you meeting me? Tomorrow?
What's the rush?
[28:54] Wait a while. I don't think that my family will let me leave alone now.
[29:00] These minor accident happen often.
[29:04] Who will make them understand that? But I'll try to figure something out.
[29:11] Tell me... is everything alright? What happened about the robbery?
[29:17] Don't ask... Mahi is threatening me.
[29:20] All she does is talk... all she does is threaten, and nothing else.
[29:26] She threatens me with brother Adeel. 
[29:29] But brother Adeel is married now and he's busy with his wife.
[29:34] He's planning to go on his honeymoon nowadays.
[29:39] We'll go there too, one day.
[29:41] It will be so much fun.
Shall we go then.
[29:44] Have some shame. Who goes on their honeymoon before their marriage?
[29:51] Hello... this is Mirha's elder sister.
[29:56] I want to meet you. 
[29:58] She'll tell you the place.
[30:05] Have you no fear, you've crossed all limits.
[30:10] Is this what you talk about? 
[30:12] I told you to introduce me to him, but no...
[30:17] Tell him the place.
[30:33] I like the guys very much.
[30:35] He was very silent and didn't say a word.
[30:41] And Zara was saying...
[30:46] I'm sure that they'll agree to the proposal, she was very sure.
Why?
[30:53] How can Zara be so sure?
[30:58] I'm sure she know something. Why can't they accept the proposal by looking at Zara's face?
[31:07] Fareeda, what I don't understand is when you will stop being illogical.
[31:13] What did I say now?
[31:17] Look, brother Noor met us. He will go home, think about it and send us his answer.
[31:26] Until then it would be better if you stop thinking so much.
[31:32] Let them rest and me too. Turn off the lights.
[31:38] I can't even talk to you now.
[31:53] So... tell me now... how did you like Maheen?
[31:58] She was just fine.
[32:02] I was thinking of us visiting my brother's sister-in-laws daughter.
[32:06] What's the matter with you? I'm talking to you about Mahi...
[32:10] and you're talking about your relative.
[32:14] That too again.
What should I say?
[32:18] I liked them a lot. 
[32:21] They are honorable people. His son is a doctor.
[32:24] And Zara... I am satisfied just by looking at her face.
[32:28] Don't tell me that you are ready to accept their proposal.
[32:31] No... I'm just giving...
[32:35] my opinion.
For your information, Farah called.
[32:41] She was saying that Zaviar is confused.
Confused?
[32:46] Why is that?
That's how the kids are nowadays. Until and unless he talks with her...
[32:52] he won't agree to marrying her.
Are you saying that...
[32:57] Zaviar said this to Farah.
Yes.
[33:00] And... I don't think thinks will work with them.
Alright!
[33:04] Then I'll talk to Zaviar.
[33:07] I'll ask him.
I would ask you to wait a few days, let him think.
[33:12] Ask them after a few days, let them make a decision.
[33:16] And... besides, it's not like we have only one option.
[33:21] Alright.
[33:23] You are right...
[33:28] But you will not talk with anyone about a proposal.
[33:34] Alright... I will not.
[33:43] Mahi, give me my phone.
I will not, it's the root of all problems.
[33:47] Maheen, I'll complain to father.
[33:49] Complain to whoever you want, especially father.
[33:52] Don't remain silent when he father asks you why I took away your phone.
[33:56] Tell him everything.
You can't do this to me.
[33:59] I will do even worse.
[34:01] You can take this phone from mother now.
Sister Mahi...
[34:04] What's the matter? Why have you taken these warm clothes out.
[34:06] They belong to Adeel.
[34:08] I know they belong to him, but why are they out?
[34:10] Adeel mentioned that it might be cold there.
[34:12] He asked me to pack some warm clothes.
[34:15] Wasn't your planned canceled?
[34:19] Give my phone.
No, I won't it.
[34:22] It wasn't canceled, auntie just didn't want us to go right now.
[34:26] But...
But what?
[34:28] Adeel thinks that it's the right time for us to go there.
[34:31] Let go.
[34:36] Sister, do you need help?
Are you free?
[34:40] She can do her own packing.
[34:45] Tell me, I'll pack for you.
You should study, I'll do this myself.
[34:50] It's not that big of a deal.
[34:53] I'll help you. It's fine.
[34:59] Are you excited?
[35:03] Alright Ahsan, this is final. Please start working on this.
[35:17] Hello.
[35:20] What? I'll be right there.
[35:37] Mother... you were saying..
[35:42] that you won't let them go anywhere. But they are packing.
[35:48] What's the point in you creating such a scene?
[35:52] What do you mean they are packing? Are they going on their honeymoon?
[35:56] Obviously. But now, there's no point in talking to them.
[36:00] It's not like they will stop and listen to you. You'll be embarrassed for no reason.
[36:06] I swear to God! They didn't ask me once!
[36:11] They just started packing!
[36:14] Ever since that accursed girl has come into Adeel's life, he has gotten out of hand.
[36:20] Why would he ask you? 
[36:22] He has asked who he wanted to ask. 
[36:25] He talked to father about it and there's no point in you saying anything.
[36:33] I'll set him straight. I'll see how they'll leave.
[36:37] Mother, you'll be embarrassed for no reason.
[36:43] What are you saying? What do you mean there was a fire?
[36:46] I don't understand anything as well.
[36:50] What are you two talking about? A fire... where?
In the factory.
[36:55] What are you saying? Were any lives lost?
Thank God, no.
[37:00] There is no news like that. But the fire has spread.
[37:04] I need to leave for Lahore right now.
No...
[37:07] How will you take care of everything alone?
[37:11] I'll come with you?
What about things here?
[37:14] Don't worry about this place. Kamran is here he'll take care of things.
[37:18] If you two leave, what will I do here alone? I'll come along.
No...
[37:24] there is no need for you to be there. Stay here.
[37:31] Go and book the flight tickets.
[37:37] What's the matter? How come there was a fire?
[37:41] Did you notify the police?
What will the police do?
[37:45]  We can't change what happened.
[37:47] God have mercy. Why did this happen?
[37:55] Why don't you understand that you can't go? I've told you that you can't go!
[38:02] No matter what happens, I will go.
[38:05] You can go later. I'm not refusing.
[38:10] How can I make you understand? I've seen bad things. I've seen her funeral.
[38:16] She'll die. What will I tell her parents if she dies?
[38:22] You also said that something would happen to me if I leave for Karachi
[38:25] But I'm standing in front of you, alive and well.
[38:28] Nothing happened to you, but Mirha got into an accident.
[38:35] How should I tell you?
[38:40] I've seen her drenched her blood. We couldn't recognize her face.
[38:46] For God's sake mother!
[38:48] Think before you speak.
[38:52] How should I make you understand? I told you not to go to Karachi, but still you went.
[38:59] Mirha got into an accident. I'm asking you to go later.
[39:05] She'll die. I've seen her funeral!
I will go.
[39:12] I promised Zara, so I will go. I will go at any cost, no matter what happens.
[39:18] Even if I die!
[39:22] My God! Look how you're speaking to your mother!
[39:30] Why didn't I die before hearing this?
[39:35] Adeel why do you say such things? 
[39:38] You never know when a prayer might get accepted.
[39:41] You have no idea how much this hurts me.
Listen to me Zara!
[39:50] Nothing happened.
[39:54] I'm with you.
[39:57] I will not go anywhere with you.
Zara...
