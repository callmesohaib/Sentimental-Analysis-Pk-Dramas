[00:12] instead of having a sister like you
[00:14] it would have been better for you to die the day Adeel had died 
Zaini!
[00:18] Saad! How dare you to touch my sister?
[00:23] I had honored him like my son
[00:26] I used to trust him more than myself but he deceived me
[00:33] the person whom I had considered the loyal & protector of my house
[00:38] he had proved to be the enemy of my family
[00:40] didn't you hear what Zaini had said? 
Didn't you hear what your sister had said?
[00:45] didn't you ever get to know, what your sister used to feel?
[00:48] didn't you ever see?
[00:51] then Saad wasn't at fault alone
[00:54] you are equally responsible
[00:58] sister was right
[01:01] there had been some lacking in my upbringing
[01:09] are you back?
[01:12] Maheen, this is uncle's medicine. You need to give this to him
[01:15] but first feed him something
[01:19] thank you so much dear
[01:21] we got a lot of courage due to your presence
[01:25] what are you saying, aunty?
[01:27] you are calling me your son, also you are making me a stranger by saying thanks
[01:31] mom, I am thinking to stay here with you
[01:37] No dear...
[01:39] your sister-in-law is about to get engaged, there must be plenty of work
[01:47] what about us! These are our trials so we'll bear them
[01:53] no aunty, we cannot go after leaving you worried like this
[01:58] even if Maheen will leave, still she will stay worried while thinking about here
[02:07] that's fine dear, but your mother will be worried
[02:11] I've already talked to mom
[02:13] I've told my sister, she has conveyed her the message
[02:16] Okay
[02:18] thank you so much dear
[02:22] mom, let me go & check on Zaini
[02:28] make some tea for Usama
[02:30] and then prepare food for your father
[02:35] we have worried you as well
[02:38] We got into this problem all of a sudden, we had never thought of it though
[02:44] what shall a person do..
[02:58] everything will be finished
[03:01] yes! everyone's life will be ruined. Yours, mine & Saad's. Nothing will be left Zaini

[03:34] and he succeeded

[03:43] Zaini, please control yourself. Everything will be fine
[03:47] everything is finished.. everything
[03:52] Zaini! 
Zara, what are you doing here?
[03:55] Zaini... Zaini
[03:58] sister, Saad has deceived me
[04:02] He left after leaving me alone
[04:04] No, its nothing like that Zaini
[04:08] everything is finished, sister
[04:10] there isn't any such thing.

[05:00] I don't want to listen anything
[05:03] he always gave my right to you
[05:06] also he gave my share of time to you
[05:10] he did engagement with me upon your insistence
[05:13] he cared for me upon your orders
[05:15] Zaini, he truly loves you
[05:18] I don't want such a love given in charity
[06:34] mom, take your medicine then you have to take insulin too

[06:41] No, brother hasn't come. Just now I checked his room, but he isn't there
[06:45] Ok call his friends & try to find out where he is
[06:48] mom, who must be awake at this hour?
[06:50] Ali is there, call him. He must know everything

[14:43] you came alone?
[14:44] where is your family?
[14:46] first I want to speak to Zaini
[14:48] Saad, uncle has strictly told us not to let you enter this house alone
[14:55] so it would be better for you to go & come along with your family
[14:58] who are you to stop me?
Who are you!
[15:01] why do you want to tarnish uncle's image in this neighborhood?
[15:04] what happened dear, is everything fine?
[15:06] He is Mr. Manzoor's son-in-law, right?
[15:11] did you see?
[15:13] this is the neighborhood of respectable people
[15:15] if you'll do any small inappropriate act, then these people won't take a second to exaggerate the matter
[15:21] therefore, go away from here
[15:22] I won't go, I will go & meet Zaini. Move away!
[15:29] he was Mr. Manzoor's youngest son-in-law, right?
[15:32] yes, both of them are Mr. Manzoor's son-in-laws
[15:34] so why they were fighting?
[15:36] don't know, there is something fishy for sure
[15:39] yes, nowadays all the matters are completely fishy
[15:42] and I heard that his daughter's company isn't good
[15:47] anyways leave it, why do we care?
[15:49] brother, tell me about this
[15:52] your blood pressure is fine now, first have something then take the medicine
[15:59] where is Zaini?
[16:02] she is inside her room
[16:04] did you talk to her?
[16:11] I couldn't gather the courage
what to say to her?
[16:14] in what difficult I've got into
[16:18] I don't understand what is right or wrong
[16:26] dad..
[16:32] dad...
[16:35] how are you feeling now?
[16:37] I am alive

[16:43] mom, why are you saying such things?
[16:45] you know it very well that I have no one except for both of you
[16:49] so why you did this with us?
[16:52] I haven't done anything
[16:54] its just a misunderstanding, why aren't you getting it?
[16:57] Ok leave, go away from here Zara
[17:01] your father is already not well because of you, so don't him sick anymore
[17:05] and I am telling you
[17:07] now if anyone will get hurt in my house because of you, then nobody will be as bad as me
[17:14] at least listen to me that what had happened on that day.
 Mom, you aren't listening to me at all
[17:19] didn't you hear?
[17:22] I am asking you to leave
[17:24] mom, Saad is here
[17:38] alone
[18:14] how are you?
[18:14] absolutely fine, you tell me how are you doing?
[18:17] I am also fine
[18:17] congratulations on the first day of university
congratulations to you too!
[18:21] I can't tell you Sadaf, how happy I am
[18:23] anybody can tell that after seeing you
[18:25] by the way, there are so many elite class people here
[18:29] yes, even I was observing the same
[18:32] anyways no problem, even we aren't less than anyone
[18:35] its just that you don't have to make any other mistake now, got it?
[18:37] Don't worry, I have started a new life after forgetting all the past
[18:44] Ok come, let me show you something

[18:47] its canteen is very famous, lets have some snacks
[18:50] really?

[18:54] you!
[18:55] who let you come inside?
[18:58] uncle, I tried to stop him
[19:00] let me meet Zaini once, I will fix everything
[19:04] Saad, we told you not to come alone & bring your mother along with you
[19:08] why you came alone?
[19:10] I cannot bring her, she won't be able to tolerate it
[19:14] please keep her away from this matter
[19:18] Wow! you really care about your family a lot
[19:22] "nothing shall happen to my mother"
did you think about us?
[19:26] my father is not well since last night & you are responsible for it Saad. Only you!
[19:33] if something happened to my dad, then do you know how we are going to bear it?
[19:39] I agree, nobody can bear the pain of whatever had happened
[19:43] but why aren't you guys understanding that it can be a lie or a conspiracy
[19:50] conspiracy! Who will do a conspiracy against you?
[19:54] All of us used to take very good care of you, we used to love you a lot
[19:59] why will we do a conspiracy against you?
[20:04] why aren't you guys trusting us?
[20:23] if your daughter's name is associated with my son
[20:27] then he should get married to her
[20:32] Zara & Saad shall get married
[20:35] mom, what are you saying?
[20:44] Shaista... Shaista
[20:46] See, what I have brought. Piping hot halwa puri, come lets have breakfast & enjoy

[21:01] what?
[21:04] why is he here now?
[21:08] don't know I just saw from upstairs
[21:11] I didn't go downstairs
[21:14] Saad was fighting with Usama
[21:17] he was fighting?
yes
[21:20] he was misbehaving in the neighborhood
[21:22] he started misbehaving with Usama, when he tried to stop him
[21:28] the entire neighborhood saw this spectacle
[21:30] that Rukhsana who lives next door was looking everything while standing in her balcony
[21:35] you know Rukhsana's nature very well
[21:38] don't know whomsoever she'll call & tell that what is going on here
[21:41] defamation find its way itself. Since there is a fight so now everyone will get to know
[21:48] God! We've been defamed a lot, we won't be able to face anyone
[21:52] why you & I aren't capable enough to show our face to anyone?
[21:56] whomsoever children they are, only those people are defamed. Why do we care?
[21:59] what are you saying?
[22:02] they are our family
[22:04] not strangers
[22:05] it was your own family who had put such a vile allegations on your husband, right?
[22:10] Adnan, I know whatever happened was wrong. Zara shouldn't have done this
[22:16] but what is brother Manzoor's fault in it?
[22:18] brother Manzoor has always been our well wisher
[22:21] we shouldn't leave him alone in this situation, we should take care of him
[22:25] Ok ok, now tell me what do you want from me?
[22:29] let's go downstairs & see, God forbid what if brother Manzoor gets unwell
[22:34] what if something wrong shall happen because of Saad & Zara
[22:40] lets go after doing the breakfast
[22:42] do you want to do the breakfast in this situation as well?
[22:45] I don't understand women at all
[22:48] you people know only one work, to annoy your husband. That's it!
[22:52] come, lets go
[23:06] Greetings!
[23:08] Greetings!

[24:30] one minute....
[24:32] didn't Saad came home for an entire night?
[24:35] yes Adnan uncle, we were so worried. We came to search for brother
[24:44] Okay, we thought that Saad must have told you everything
[24:48] what he must have told?
[24:51] what happened?
[24:52] mom, nothing happened. Please go home, I will tell you everything
[24:55] at least wait...
one minute, sister Asfa
[24:58] wait, we asked him to go & bring you along with him
[25:03] its good that you came here yourself, we want to discuss the entire matter in front of you
[25:09] but sister Sarwat, what's the matter? What had happened?
[25:14] has Saad done any mistake? What he did?
[25:18] mistake! He has committed a sin
[25:22] He was caught red-handed with our daughter Zara
[25:29] Adnan! What are you saying?
[25:33] sorry to say sister, but this is true
[25:36] we had fixed our daughter's proposal in your family, by considering you an honorable family
[25:40] also we had seek your daughter's proposal from you, but we didn't know that...
[25:43] everyone is such a culprit here
[25:47] after all, what's the matter? Will anyone tell me what had happened?
[25:52] mom, nothing happened. It was just a misunderstanding. Please lets go home
[25:55] we didn't had any misunderstanding. Not at all
[25:59] we have a proof
[26:01] what are you saying Adnan uncle, how can you put such an allegation on brother?
[26:08] where is Zaini? What is this happening, will somebody tell me
[26:11] don't think about Zaini anymore
[26:15] we won't even let his shadow fall on the girl like Zaini
[26:18] brother Manzoor, why are you standing quietly? Why aren't you saying anything?
[26:24] what shall I say?
[26:26] I don't have anything to say
[26:29] whatever Adnan is saying is right
[26:32] No no, this cannot be true. How can you guys put this allegation on my brother?
[26:36] Allegation! Dolly, if it had been only an allegation then why we would have believed it?
[26:41] whatever our eyes saw, we cannot deny it Dolly
[26:46] Ali you! you are saying all this?
[26:51] you know my brother, he is not that kind of a person
[26:54] don't you trust brother?
[26:56] your brother has ruined the life of both of my sisters! How can I tolerate it?
[27:01] tell me!
[27:03] how are you talking to Dolly?
[27:06] Wow, this is great Saad
The pot calling the kettle black
[27:11] you did the robbery, you are the sinner. And now you are scolding Ali, wow!
[27:17] Tell me, where was your self-respect at that time?
[27:20] how will you fulfill your relations in the future?
[27:24] if you were so modest, then why did you ruin the lives of both of our daughters?
[27:29] you...
[27:30] stop!
[27:32] what proof do you have?
[27:33] what proof do you have that my son did all this?
[27:37] yes...
[27:39] we have a proof
[28:42] Greetings mom!
[28:44] greetings!
[28:46] in whose car you came?
[28:47] mom, I made a new friend in the university. So it was her car, & she had dropped me today
[28:54] have you seen the time? Its almost evening time
[28:57] are these the off timings of your university?
[28:59] No mom, actually today I got a bit late at the library
[29:03] and I wasn't alone, Sadaf & Sehrish was also with me
[29:06] Sadaf, Sehrish!
[29:08] Who are they?
[29:10] you must have made new friends in the university
[29:13] I am telling you there is no need to make new friends in the university
[29:18] which friends you have, they are enough
[29:22] why are you burning your blood for no reason?
[29:25] it will happen daily now, become habitual of it
[29:28] it won't happen daily, mom
[29:30] it happened only today, it won't happen next time
[29:32] you have to be back home before 4 pm, I am telling you
[29:37] otherwise, I won't listen to your father as well & make you sit at home simply
[29:42] its not good for the girls to stay outside the house in the evening time
[29:46] why don't you get it?
[29:49] I got tired of explaining the same thing to Adeel my entire life
[29:53] that don't roam around outside the house with your wife after evening time
[29:57] but he didn't listened to me at all
[30:00] what happened?
[30:02] he left us
[30:05] even you guys don't understand
[30:06] mom...
you made mom cry
[30:22] mom... this
[30:44] why you did this?
[30:46] Saad, what have you done?
[30:49] why you did this? What was the need to do this?
[30:52] you've made me ashamed in front of all
[30:57] mom this is not true, please believe me. Its not true
[31:03] your son has stabbed on our back, sister Asfa
[31:08] I had considered him as my son
[31:11] but the way he has repaid for my favors
[31:15] I can never imagine
[31:24] what mistake we did?
[31:26] that he deceived us?
[31:28] uncle, believe me I haven't done any such thing
[31:31] due to which you or mom shall feel ashamed
[31:35] you have already lowered your mother's head
[31:38] how will you fulfill your future relations now?
[31:43] I beg in front of you all
[31:45] believe on my words for once. Forget everything & trust me once
[31:49] I will clear everyone's doubts & misunderstandings
[31:53] how shall we believe you, Saad? How shall we trust you?
[32:00] sister Asfa, we have never considered your house different than our house
[32:05] after your husband's demise.. 
[32:08] Mr. Manzoor took the responsibility of your entire house & family, right?
[32:13] he never made you realize, although we never had any benefit
[32:19] but we had never signified it
[32:21] then... 
[32:23] why are you signifying it today?
[32:25] I am not signifying the favors
[32:27] I am just making you realize
[32:31] we have experienced a huge loss, how to repent it?
[32:35] we will do it
[32:39] we will do it, sister Sarwat
[32:43] I haven't forgotten your favors
[32:47] the favors you did on me
[32:50] I have never forgotten them
[32:52] its mortgage until my last breathe
[32:58] we didn't had any value as compared to you people
[33:02] but still... 
[33:04] but still you gave your daughter to my son
[33:09] also you gave respect to my daughter in your house
[33:13] today, when your honor is tarnished because of my son
[33:20] so we'll repay for it
[33:23] mom!
[33:26] don't expect anything else from me anymore, sister Asfa
[33:29] I respect you a lot, but I won't be able to do it
[33:37] I cannot marry my daughter with such a person who has hurt my trust & belief
[33:50] I can never forgive him
[33:53] he should be punished for his actions
[34:01] I cannot keep Zaini & Saad's relation intact at any cost
[34:09] you may consider it over from my side
[34:11] uncle don't do this please
[34:16] dad, you cannot do this
[34:20] brother, even your daughter had made a mistake
[34:25] so why my son shall only be punished?
[34:36] mom, what are you saying?
[34:39] be quiet
[34:43] brother... 
[34:48] if your daughter's name is associated with my son
[34:52] then he should get married to her 
[34:57] Zara & Saad shall get married
[35:00] mom, what are you saying?
[35:40] what are you saying, sister Asfa?
[35:43] how is this possible?
[35:46] why it cannot be, sister Sarwat?
[35:49] it takes two to make a quarrel
[35:56] I have never said any such thing, nor I want to do
[36:00] but since last few months, there had been so many questions on Zara's character
[36:06] and they aren't hidden from anyone
[36:09] I have never used any inappropriate words. I've always considered Zara as my own daughter
[36:15] but today when my son is standing in front of you as a criminal
[36:20] So nobody thought about him even for once?
[36:24] you've only used bad words for him
[36:30] so sister, only you are benefited in all the matters. Just think
[36:35] right brother? Am I saying anything wrong?
[36:38] brother had fixed his daughter's marriage with your son, although he didn't had a job
[36:43] furthermore, he got his only son married to your daughter without any greed
[36:48] now tell me, who is benefited in all this? Tell us
[36:53] you got associated with such a good family
[36:56] enough Adnan... 
[37:00] Enough Adnan enough!
[37:03] don't utter a single word anymore, I've heard you enough
[37:07] its our personal matter, it would be better for you not to interfere in it
[37:12] whatever you have to say, you've said it. That's it!
[37:17] now let us speak
[37:22] aunty, how can you think this way? That we'll get Saad & Zara married
[37:29] why not?
[37:31] what other option do we have?
[37:33] when the allegation is on both of them, then both of them should be punished
[37:36] your brother is not capable enough that we shall wed off our sister with him
[37:41] I used to say it earlier, not to fix the marriage in this family
[37:45] but they have made the relation with you along with Saad
[37:49] you people were not capable enough with whom we should have made any relation
[37:53] I won't do this marriage
[37:57] Saad, be quiet!
[38:00] brother look, I am saying this to you once again
[38:04] you may give Zara's proposal to me
[38:07] the mistake which my son & your daughter has committed, it cannot be fixed by anyone else
[38:12] and brother, you know it very well that if anyone can hide this stain of defamation then its only Saad
[38:21] except for him, nobody will accept Zara with this stain of defamation
[38:44] I agree
[38:53] I agree to get Zara & Saad married
