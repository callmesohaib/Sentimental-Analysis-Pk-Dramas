[00:12] Do you know when my grandson comes into this world I'll take good care of him.
[00:19] I will love him loads,
[00:22] I will never let him be away from me.
[00:26] What if it is a daughter?
What are you saying?
[00:31] Mirha went to meet that guy again today.
[00:34] Did Mirha tell you this?
[00:36] Why would she tell me?
[00:38] She's your friend not mine. I'm sure she must have told you.
[00:42] No, Mirha didn't talk to me about this.
[00:45] I've already announced my decision.
[00:47] I cannot live without Aqib and I can't even think of leaving him.
[00:52] Mirha...
Sister please.
[00:54] If you can't do anything from me, then there's no need to interfere in my matters.
[02:09] What's the matter?
[02:10] I think something went in my eye.
Show me.
[02:15] Open you eyes and look up.
[02:19] Is it fine now?
[02:27] What are you looking at?
Your eyes.
[02:32] Have you never seen them before?
[02:35] You never let me and today I have an opportunity to look at them.
[02:44] What's the matter now?
[02:47] Nothing.
[02:51] Look at me.
[02:58] Smile... just like that.
[03:09] Zaini... I know that you always complain that I never express myself.
[03:19] It's because I don't know how to.
[03:24] But I want to try.
[03:31] Zaini there is only you in my heart.
[03:42] Zara might have a hand in making you a part of my life..
[03:48] but you're the one who made her place in my heart.
[03:54] I never realized that...
[03:59] you are the one who made me realize that love shouldn't be restricted to oneself.
[04:08] Rather, it is something that is shared between two people..
[04:17] I love you Zaini.
[04:21] Will you have faith in my love?
[04:26] Tell me, will you?
[04:39] That's for you.
Thank you so much.
[04:45] So beautiful, thank you.
[04:50] Thank you.
[05:43] Thank you so much.
You look beautiful.
[05:55] Uh... this is really very pretty.
[06:00] Thank you.
Are you happy now?
[06:07] Very much so.
Are you sure?
[06:10] No more complaints?
[06:33] What need was there for father to take advice from Zara?
[06:37] What's your problem with this now?
[06:39] The problem is with you and father. First it was only father...
[06:43] but now you have started as well. You tell her everything.
[06:47] So what if we took her advice?
She will tell her entire family now.
[06:55] If family doesn't tell their family, they are bound to found out about it one way or another.
[06:59] Rather, your father will tell your aunt today.
Stop father.
[07:05] What do you mean? Have you gone insane?
[07:10] Should we marry you in secret?
[07:12] I thought this was going to be a simple wedding. So what's all the fuss about?
[07:16] Don't speak nonsense in front of me
[07:18] Besides don't you know that your father can't live without...
[07:24] telling his sister. Keep that in mind, this will not remain a secret.
[07:30] Why are you getting angry? What's the matter with you?
[07:34] This will make no difference anymore.
[07:37] I know why you are doing this, it's because you hate Zara.
[07:43] Understand one thing Mahi, Zara is not like we thought her to be.
[07:52] What didn't you do to her?
[07:54] If she wanted she could have been stubborn and not let this wedding take place.
[08:01] But she didn't do that.
[08:06] You should clear your heart as well.
[08:09] She hasn't told anyone about this at her home.
[08:13] Try and be happy and stop this.
[08:19] Cool your anger and have breakfast.
[08:28] Mahi.
[08:32] My God!
[08:39] Maheen, I'm running late, could you please make me breakfast quickly.
[08:42] Sure I'll make it.
[08:59] Usama... Usama...
[09:08] Yes mother?
[09:10] Teach your wife respect. She didn't even greet me.
[09:16] Alright... mother...
[09:18] Here's money for the household expenses. I forgot to give it to you last night.
[09:26] But son, this is not that much.
I gave some to Maheen as well.
[09:31] Alright.
[09:33] Tell me something... did she talk about separating your home?
[09:38] No mother she didn't. I'm running late, let me have breakfast.
[09:42] Alright.
[09:51] How do I look?
[09:56] Hmm... you do look nice.
[10:00] Make sure no one gazes at your for long.
But I want you to gaze at me.
[10:05] Saad, try being serious for once.
[10:08] Why... do you think this is a joke?
Aren't you running late now?
[10:13] I'll go then and how will you go to university.
[10:17] I'm off today.
What about tomorrow?
[10:20] Should I come to pick you up. I'll drop you on the way.
[10:23] No, I'll manage.
[10:27] Alright fine. I'll visit you on my way back.
Okay.
[10:31] Farewell*
[11:02] I thought you liked this job.
[11:05] You worked hard for it. I even asked you to move here, but you didn't.
[11:11] But why this now?
[11:13] Father I can find a job here as well.
[11:16] I don't want to live there anymore.
Alright.
[11:21] I've never stopped you in the past, nor will I now.
[11:25] But it's not wise to take decisions so suddenly.
[11:30] Your father is right. Think about it once more. It's not easy to find a job.
[11:38] Mother I've thought about this. I want to live with you all.
[11:46] As you wish.
Thank you father.
[11:51] Father, one more thing.
Sure...
[11:56] I know that this isn't the time to talk about this...
[12:01] It's possible that you might get upset with me as well.
[12:07] Whatever it is say it openly.
Is it possible that...
[12:15] you have me and Dolly married.
What?
[12:21] What are you saying? Are you in your senses? Where did this come from all of a sudden?
[12:27] Take it easy. Let me talk to him.
[12:31] Have you seen the state of your sister.
[12:35] How can you get married?
[12:38] You're his only brother. How can you even think of being so careless.
[12:46] Do you even realize what your sister is going through?
[12:50] Are you just concerned with your happiness?
[12:52] It's not like that, you have it wrong. Zara is not separate from me.
[12:59] I know how she feels.
[13:02] Alright then, be patient for a while. We'll think about this later.
[13:08] Did Dolly ask you of this?
No mother, she didn't say anything.
[13:16] Even if she did, there's nothing wrong with it. Zara mentioned her marriage as well
[13:24] Things were different back then, we were compelled.
[13:29] Then think that I'm compelled as well. Otherwise I would not have asked you of this.
[13:34] You know how important Zara is for me.
[13:37] What are you so compelled by then?
[13:41] Why are you not ready to hear us out?
[13:46] What happened?
[13:49] You don't know what's going on in that home.
[13:53] What do you mean? I don't understand.
Maheen raised her hand on Dolly.
[13:59] Without any reason.
[14:06] What should I do in this?
[14:08] That poor girl comes here to care for you two.
[14:10] She's the daughter-in-law of this house and she acts that way by taking care of you all.
[14:14] Sister Maheen... I can't believe it
[14:20] That's why I wanted to talk to you about this.
[14:48] That's why Dolly and her mother left that so suddenly.
[14:54] Why didn't you tell me this before?
[14:57] Dolly didn't want to tell anyone this.
This is not something small.
[15:02] You should have at least told your mother or me.
[15:06] I told you not to cut that girl slack, look what happened now because of it.
[15:13] That's why sister Maheen agreed to returning with brother Usama.
[15:18] If she was here everyone would have known.
[15:25] I didn't expect this from Maheen.
[15:28] Dolly is our daughter-in-law and she shouldn't have been treated that way.
[15:34] Sarwat you should have kept an eye on Maheen at least.
[15:38] If I had known I would have taken her to her in-laws.
[15:44] She has embarrassed us in front of everyone.
[15:49] That's why I want you to make a decision.
[15:53] Otherwise sister Maheen has told that Dolly that she won't let this marriage happen.
[15:58] Who is she to decide this? Your parents are still alive.
[16:06] Give me some time to think.
[16:11] Alright father. I'll do as you say.
[16:15] I know that you will be just to everyone.
[16:20] Whatever you decide will be better for everyone.
[16:52] What have you decided then?
[16:57] I don't understand anything.
[17:02] If you want, do you want me to talk to my brother?
[17:24] Mother has invited me home.
[17:25] Is everything alright?
I don't know, I'll know that once I go.
[17:29] Can you pick me up?
[17:30] No I have an important meeting. You can go yourself, I'll pick you up.
[17:36] Sure, farewell.
Where are you going?
[17:41] To my mother's home.
Why?
[17:45] I don't know... I'll know that once I go there.
[17:50] Who will do the housework?
[17:53] Shela and Savera are here. They'll take care of it.
[17:57] They always do. But this house is your responsibility
[18:02] and you should look after it as I have.
[18:05] Go wherever you want, but before that cook lunch.
[18:11] You always have somewhere to go.
[18:26] How will all of this happen so quickly.
[18:31] It will, don't worry.
[18:34] Zaviar has stated that he will look after all the arrangements.
[18:40] I pray that everything goes well for our daughter this time.
[18:48] Amen. God willing, that's how it will happen.
[18:52] Last time Mahi was not at fault. That guy couldn't take care of our daughter.
[19:01] Forget about what happened and thank God that we have found honorable people this time.
[19:11] Otherwise who sends a proposal for a divorcee?
[19:18] This way we'll get another chance to see a happy occasion.
[19:24] They were the ones who initiated a proposal.
[19:29] Of course...
You're right.
[19:34] Sarwat is calling.
[19:38] Greetings.
[19:42] Yes everything is well... we are considering a proposal for Mahi.
[19:50] If anyone from our family tells them...
[19:55] that you are divorced.
No one is that bold.
[19:59] Just ask Zara to keep her mouth shut.
[20:18] Did you talk to him?
Yes.
[20:22] What did he tell you?
I didn't ask.
[20:28] But you called for advice didn't you?
[20:32] They are talking about Mahi's wedding there.
[20:36] Mahi's wedding.
[20:39] They've received a proposal and the groom's family want the wedding done on Friday.
[20:44] Really... what did you decide then?
[20:49] They've decided to do a simple wedding ceremony.
[20:55] Did you talk about Zara?
[20:59] Brother told me that sister wasn't agreeing to it when they asked for date so soon.
[21:06] Zara was the one who convinced her.
[21:11] Zara is very smart. She has made everyone like her there.
[21:20] I was thinking that they shouldn't have any objections if we announce to get Ali and Dolly married.
[21:29] They shouldn't, this way Zara will come visit.
[21:42] What's the matter? What are you thinking about?
[21:46] I'm thinking how helpless of a father I am.
[21:51] I've finding excuses to invite my daughter here.
[21:53] You agree to listening to Ali, right?
[21:58] Maheen...
[22:02] didn't leave my any way as well.
[22:05] Once Mahi is married.
[22:09] Maheen has embarrassed me.
[22:15] I don't know how I will be able to look sister Asma in the eye
[22:19] I've called her here today. Once she's here I'll give her a piece of my mind.
[22:32] Let's go and pray.
Sure, let's go.
[22:51] What's the matter? Why the long face?
[22:57] We shouldn't have hidden something like this from your father.
[23:02] If your father finds out...
[23:05] What thing?
About your divorce.
[23:09] I told him that when they were here you told the guy yourself.
[23:14] So what now?
He was asking again and I had to lie again.
[23:21] That's not a big deal, it's not the first time you lied.
Quiet!
[23:25] I lied on your say so. I've asked him not to mention it to anyone.
[23:30] What can we do about you hiding this now?
[23:32] This is not something trivial.
[23:36] Mother, you are making me afraid.
I'm also afraid.
[23:40] If anyone from our extended family tells them...
[23:44] that you are married.
No one is that bold.
[23:48] Just ask Zara to keep her mouth shut. Look at this...
[23:53] How does this dress look?
[23:57] It's good.
This is the one I'll wear.
[24:01] There was one more... this one.
[24:07] Yes, this one's good too.
[24:22] And you guys believed her?
[24:25] First answer me, did you raise your hand on her?
[24:28] Mother... I was in anger... I didn't raise my hand on purpose.
[24:34] We are the ones who gave you slack....
[24:36] We have given you a lot of freedom.
[24:38] Do you want me to beg, cry and apologize to her!
[24:43] Your tongue is so sharp.
[24:48] This doesn't happen in honorable families.
[24:51] Tell me something. You listened to your son...
[24:55] Why did he take his fiance's side without listening to his sister?
[25:00] He should have at least asked my what made me so angry.
[25:04] It makes no difference as to what made you angry.
[25:07] Don't we know you?
[25:10] This was wrong in every way!
[25:14] Your father is very upset at you.
[25:18] Dolly is exaggerating this.
[25:21] Enough! Silence! If you don't want your...
[25:27] father to be strict with you so stay away from the matters of this home.
[25:32] Your father is still alive to look after the matters of this house!
[25:37] Leave it to him. What's your problem?
[25:43] Always ready to fight.
[26:18] My dear child, this doesn't happen in an honorable household.
[26:26] This was wrong in every way.
[26:30] Your father is very upset at you as well.
[26:35] If you want your father to not be strict with you then stay away from the matters of this house.
[26:42] Your father is still alive to look after the matters of this house.
[26:48] Leave it to him. What's your problem?
[27:03] Father is calling you.
[27:51] Father...
[27:53] You called me?
[27:58] Maheen I've always ignored all your mistakes because you were my eldest daughter
[28:05] Because I think daughters have more right over their parents than sons.
[28:12] No matter how much importance is given to sons in this society...
[28:18] but in this world I've always given importance to my daughters.
[28:23] But I didn't realize that this would embarrass me in front of the world one day.
[28:32] Father...
Keep quiet!
[28:36] No explanation can justify what you did.
[28:47] If you want this house to stay open to you then you'll have to apologize to Dolly.
[29:13] Hello...
Where are you? I've been calling you for ages.
[29:16] I did message you. Father called me and I was with him.
[29:21] I know... but it's been two hours since that.
[29:24] You know that if I don't talk to you every five minutes...
[29:27] I feel weird.
Oh Aqib
[29:32] Father wanted to talk about something important so he called everyone.
[29:35] That's what took so long.
Something important? Is everything alright?
[29:40] Does your father know about  me?
[29:43] No it's not like that. There was a proposal for my sister.
[29:48] And they want to do the wedding ceremony this Friday.
[29:51] That's what we were talking about.
[29:55] Alright... this calls for a treat.
[29:59] Why not? Sure... since sister will be leave soon...
[30:04] there will be no one stopping us from talking to each, seeing each other...
[30:08] I'm so happy Aqib.
After that...
[30:13] we will try to convince our families.
[30:17] What were you saying?
[30:22] Father... you can make me do anything but...
[30:26] don't say this. I will not apologize to her.
Enough!
[30:33] Enough! I've tolerated you insolence too long, but not anymore!
[30:43] Dolly will soon be the daughter-in-law of this house!
[30:47] She is the daughter of my dead friend.
[30:50] How will I look him in the eye during the day of judgment?
[30:57] I promised my friend that I will always be there for his children.
[31:06] But you have embarrassed me.
[31:10] You wasted all my hard work. You broke my pride.
[31:20] I didn't do anything.
[31:23] She was being rude... I didn't do it on purpose.
[31:28] You should have silenced yourself then.
[31:30] What need was there to raise your hand?
[31:36] Elder sisters are supposed to be like mothers.
[31:40] If people younger than you are being rude then it's your duty to make them realize their mistake.
[31:46] But the path you chose was wrong.
[31:51] Did you think that she was only your sister-in-law?
[31:56] She is also Zaini's soon to be sister-in-law.
[31:59] Do you realize the difficulties you could have created for her?
[32:04] She doesn't care about any relationship.
[32:08] Mother and father you are being unjust.
[32:13] I left that day because I didn't want things to be hard for you two.
[32:19] Yes my dear... I thought that too.
[32:24] I was under the impression that you went home because you couldn't your father being helpless.
[32:34] But no, I was wrong. You went there to hide your mistake.
[32:42] Father...
Enough.
[32:44] Enough...
[32:47] My head has bowed down in shame.
[32:52] I cannot tolerate anymore embarrassment.
[33:13] Maheen...
[33:17] You will have to apologize to Dolly.
[33:23] You have no other option.
[33:29] Do you understand?
[33:32] Father...
[34:30] Hello...
[34:32] Greetings*
[34:36] Who is this?
It's be Zaviar.
[34:39] You?
Yes.
[34:42] How did you get my number?
[34:45] It's not hard to get someone's number.
[34:48] That's true... the person you took my number, what must they think about us?
[34:54] Don't worry, she won't think anything like that. Farah gave me your number.
[34:59] Oh... you are quite good friends with Farah.
[35:03] Yes, we're of the same age...
[35:05] We have been good friend since we were kids.
[35:07] I'm sure you're good friends with your sister as well.
[35:10] Of course.
What have you decided then?
[35:15] About what?
What are you wearing to the wedding?
[35:19] I've looked a few things, but I haven't finalized it.
[35:23] Really... what if I want to send you something? Would you mind?
[35:29] Pardon?
Tell me.
[35:32] No... you can.
[35:36] Alright then. I'll select a dress and have it sent to you today.
[35:43] Mother has called sister Maheen home.
[35:46] Then you should have been present there Ali.
[35:49] I don't want to talk to sister Maheen.
[35:52]  I talked to her as much as I could.
[35:55] Ali you know sister Maheen. She won't like this.
Let her.
[36:00] This is nothing compared to the way she insulted you.
[36:13] Thank you.
[36:16] For what?
For understanding me and taking a stand for me
[36:21] Look Dolly I know that you can never be wrong...
[36:26] That's why I took a stand for you. I hope you aren't upset at my anymore.
[36:33] I wasn't upset at you before, I was just upset overall.
[36:39] Do you know that you get upset in such an innocent manner.
[36:49] When's your flight?
[36:52] Tomorrow morning.
When will you return?
[36:56] Next month.
After so many days?
[37:01] It's my job, I can only come back after I fulfill my formalities.
[37:14] Ali, is what we're doing okay?
[37:19] Why would you think otherwise?
[37:22] I don't know... did you talk to Zara?
[37:27] I called her, her phone was off... I'll try again.
[37:31] We need to tell her as well.
[37:37] Will you eat lunch?
Sure, if you made it.
[37:42] I'll be right back.
[38:03] Shela... why are you wearing Maheen's suit?
[38:08] So what if I wore it?
What do you mean?
[38:11] You know she doesn't like this. You've fought with her on this before.
[38:16] Let there be another fight... what's with you?
[38:21] Forget your anger..
[38:25] and look how lovely it looks on me.
Shela...
[38:28] You have no shortage of clothes. Take off her clothes!
[38:34] Mother what's so wrong? I'll change after I take a few pictures.
[38:39] What if she comes back before you're done?
[38:40] What do you want there to be a fight?
Are you afraid of her?
[38:46] Why would I be afraid? Then let her see that I'm wearing her suit.
[38:51] You will not change... look at who's at the door... go...
[38:58] It's brother.
Greetings*
[39:03] Why didn't you bring Maheen along?
[39:05] She stayed at her mother's.
She stayed?
[39:09] And we're waiting for her here?
[39:12] Did you have something for her?
[39:13] This is her home.
[39:17] It's not good for her to go to her mother's house so often.
[39:19] You should talk to her.
[39:21] What should I talk to her about? She never sits down with us.
[39:26] She doesn't leave her home.
[39:32] This is Maheen's dress, right?
I liked it so...
[39:38] Go and change...
Alright!
[39:45] Mother ask her not to wear Maheen's clothes. She doesn't like it.
[39:51] Alright, I will make her understand. 
[39:53] You shouldn't have let her stay there. She stays there so regularly!
