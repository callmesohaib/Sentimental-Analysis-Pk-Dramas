[00:13] I will always keep you happy.
[00:19] I won't let anyone do injustice to you again.
[00:23] I am hundred percent sure
[00:25] Well, I agree that Adeel is a very nice boy and he loves you so much.
[00:30] But what will you say about his family?
[00:33] They won't let you live happily. They will make your life hell.
[00:36] Think about it. You will have to think about it right now.
[00:40] Why? What happened? What has she done?
[00:43] She has told her father that she can't wait anymore so fix my marriage.
[00:47] Oh my God.
[00:52] She said this to her real father
[01:03] Don't take Zara's words seriously Mr. Manzoor. She is just a little girl and very emotional.
[01:09] She said this out of emotions and pressure.
[01:13] But what happened to you.
[01:14] Why did you agree with her? Why didn't you advise her?
[01:17] Why do you forget Sarwat?
[01:21] Zara is not only our daughter, she is also his wife.
[01:24] No, she is not.
[01:26] Only their Nikah is done, they are not properly married yet.
[01:31] So why are you giving that much right to him now.
[01:33] This is so childish from you.
[01:36] I am not talking childishly, you are doing that.
[01:41] Their Nikah is done and they are husband and wife.
[01:47] Adeel can take Zara with him whenever he wants.
[01:52] And Zara also can go to his husband whenever she wants.
[01:55] No matter whether wedding function is arranged or not.
[01:59] This is neither illegal nor against our religious practices.
[02:04] So tell Adeel
[02:06] Tell him that if he will shift to Karachi only then we will send Zara with him.
[02:12] Why are you staring at me like this?
[02:15] Tell him.
[02:17] If he needs Zara's companionship then he will have to shift to Karachi.
[02:20] If he needs Zara?
[02:23] We have already given Zara to him. She is his wife now.
[02:31] OK, I will go to Hyderabad and talk to them.
[02:37] Don't cry, just pray for her. God will make things better.
[04:06] Adeel, dad is going to Hyderabad to fix our marriage.
[04:11] So suddenly?
[04:14] Zara tell me clearly, what is happening there.
[04:16] Everyone is worried here and dad is going to Hyderabad to end this worry.
[04:22] Is it possible that he wait for few days.
[04:25] Let things get normal then we will discuss about it.
[04:28] Dad has planned everything and he is about to leave.
[04:34] OK don't worry, my duty is about to finish. I will handle everything at home.
[04:40] Please message me once you reach home.
[04:44] Good bye.
Good bye.
[05:11] If you want to talk to me then call me.
[05:14] Greetings, Zenny told us that you are about to leave for Hyderabad immediately.
[05:18] Yes, I am leaving now.
[05:19] Brother you should have told us, we would also go with you to discuss the matter with them.
[05:25] He hasn't left yet, you can go with him now.
[05:30] Saad is going with me, if I would need him then I would take him with me.
[05:36] Saad is just a kid. He isn't taking me with him.
[05:42] If there was any mishap then Adnan will help you.
[05:46] Am I going to a war front for war.
[05:49] Why don't you understand such a minor thing?
[05:53] Brother is absolutely right.
[05:55] God forbid, it's not a serious matter that he has to take so many people with him to resolve this issue.
[06:00] Do you know..
Sister...
[06:02] if God wills, everything will be alright. Don't worry.
[06:05] Shaista you don't know that they talked to him very rudely on phone,
[06:09]  God knows what will they do in one on one meeting.
That's why I want to go alone.
[06:14] They are Zara's in-laws.
[06:16] We don't fight with daughter's in-laws.
[06:22] That is groom's family and they will always have an upper hand.
[06:25] Will I have to tell you again?
OK brother you are right.
[06:29] Please go with Saad and talk to them. Right?
[06:40] Where is Saad, let me call him.
[06:57] I think you are making this decision in a hurry.
[07:00] And this can be wrong.
[07:02] Saad, this matter is being discussed for a long time.
[07:05] Dad took my opinion.
[07:07] And I told him about my internal feelings.
[07:10] And there is nothing wrong with it.
[07:12] We shouldn't share each and every feeling of our heart with others.
[07:15] Uncle has talked to Mahi.
[07:18] Now we should have waited for their response.
[07:22] And what do you think that Mahi mustn't have discussed with her parents.
[07:27] No.
[07:29] She won't discuss.
[07:31] Even then you said that to uncle that you want to marry now.
[07:34] Saad I am not in a hurry to get married.
[07:37] I just share my opinion, marriage will be done when dad and my family will want.
[07:42]  I am not in a hurry to get married.
[07:45] This is not the case.
[07:48] The point is that you can't see anything else other than Adeel.
[07:52] But you won't understand.
You are saying this Saad?
[07:57] I can't believe it.
[08:00] OK, tell me one thing.
[08:01] If I would get married to someone else except Adeel
[08:05]  then what would be the guarantee that groom's family members must be nice.
[08:09] We know Adeel and he cares for me. He is with me in every good and bad time.
[08:13] Why don't you understand this Saad?
[08:16] Hello.
[08:20] Yes, I am coming. Good bye.
[08:25] My friend has brought the car.
[08:28] I am going.
[08:58] Please call me as soon as you reach there.
[10:29] What are you doing Mirha?
[10:32] I am reading book. What happened?
[10:36] Nothing.
[10:38] Mom told me that when you got that accident, you were not alone, someone was with you.
[10:47] Who was he?
[10:48] I don't know him. I was just standing there
[10:53] I got accident by his bike.
Don't lie.
[10:57] Tell me the truth. Who was that boy?
[10:59] I don't know, who was he? He was a bike rider.
[11:02] He was riding his bike rashly and hit me.
[11:05] OK, if you don't want to tell me then as you wish.
[11:08] But your face is telling me that you are lying.
[11:14] What do you think that I will believe on your story?
[11:18] One more thing
[11:21] One this is confirmed.
[11:23] That boy is not just a bike rider Mirha.
[11:57] Hey brother, how much will you give me for this?
[12:07] It not worth more than seven or eight thousand.
[12:10] You are mentioning seven / eight thousand for a phone which worth fifty thousand rupees. 
[12:12] Don't do this dude.
[12:14] Brother you can ask as much as you want because it is yours.
[12:17] But it worth same what I told you because it neither has warranty nor it's box.
[12:23] Brother at least raise the price to twenty five thousand since it's actual worth is fifty thousand.
[12:28] Brother if I will buy this for twenty five thousand then in what price I will sell this phone? 
[12:32] We have to do that.
[12:34] At least raise price. You are stuck at your price.
[12:37] OK tell me your final price.
[12:39] At least twenty five or thirty thousand.
[12:42] No, twenty five thousand is too much. 
[12:44] Touch market if you get your desired price. I can only give you this much.
[12:51] So you will take it in seven/eight thousand.
Yes.
[12:57] OK
[13:23] Let me do this.
No, leave it. I will do that.
[13:28] Are you angry with me?
[13:31] That doesn't make any difference to you Zara
[13:33] It does make a difference Maheen. We are sisters.
[13:37] Your anger matters to me.
[13:41] I was advising you being your sister.
[13:44] But now do what you want.
[13:46] I won't say anything to you Zara.
[14:22] I had already informed you that I can't stay late.
[14:25] My guests are arriving so I have to go home.
[14:28] But you didn't tell me earlier.
[14:30] Everyone has received roasters in the morning.
[14:32] If you had told me in the morning then I would have managed.
[14:35] OK, tell me if you can manage anything now.
[14:37] I am sorry doctor, it's not possible right now 
[14:40] because new shift is about to start in twenty minutes time.
[14:43] And I can't arrange anything so soon. I am sorry.
[15:03] How is Mirha feeling now?
[15:06] She is fine and feeling better now.
[15:08] She is sleeping, meet her when she will awake.
[15:13] When will brother Ahmed come back?
[15:17] I don't know about his return.
[15:21] No one informs me about his arrival and departure in this house.
[15:24] No one gives me importance.
[15:28] You have a special place in this house.
[15:32] Didn't Adeel tell you that he won't be able to come tonight.
[15:36] No I didn't talk to him.
[15:38] It's so surprising because he tells you everything.
[15:41] Didn't he inform you that he has to do double shift.
[15:47] Saad you look uncomfortable to me.
[15:50] If you are tired then take some rest. Let me show you your room
[15:54] Yes, so kind of you. Show me the room.
[15:58] Come with me. You come with me as well uncle.
OK.
[16:01] Let's meet later.
Come.
[16:09] Uncle, your phone.
[16:27] You used to say that brother Manzoor is your dear brother and takes good care of you but
[16:32] So what?
So what?
[16:35] If he is your brother then I am his brother-in-law. Right?
[16:38] I am his brother-in-law. Right?
[16:39] Zenny is his daughter and Saad is future husband of his daughter.
[16:43] So status of son-in-law and brother-in-law is equal. Right?
[16:47] I was hundred percent sure.
[16:50] That you will say such thing.
[16:52] I am not saying this without any reason.
[16:54] I am just telling you and opening your eyes. Be wise enough.
[16:58] So let me unfold your wisdom.
[17:01] I am not his real sister.
[17:04] He is my distant relative.
[17:06] It's his will, whom to take with him or not.
[17:10] We shouldn't complain.
[17:11] I am not complaining.
[17:14] I am reminding you that you have no worth in that house and they don't give you any importance.
[17:20] So don't favor your brother.
[17:24] When brother Manzoor was leaving, maybe you have forgotten that what he said.
[17:30] That you are habitual of exaggerating minor things.
[17:34] That's why I am taking Saad with me.
[17:36] I understood that he was pointing towards you.
[17:40] But maybe you couldn't understand.
[17:42] Towards me?
Yes.
[17:44] If you are that much wise then you would have succeeded in your life.
[18:09] Thank you my child.
[18:10] No problem uncle. If you need any thing then please call me.
[18:15] Well, I talked to you regarding marriage of Zara and Adeel.
[18:23] Did you discuss with your parents?
[18:26] Yes uncle you talked to me but
[18:28] There is a difference between environments of our house and your house.
[18:33] It is not considered good to talk to elders about such matters.
[18:37] I am sorry if you mind but you shouldn't have discussed that with me.
[18:44] My child, I just told you that you can convey that to your parents.
[18:50] And you are elder than Adeel.
Yes I am elder than him.
[18:54] But I am not elder than my parents.
[18:56] That I tell them about my decision.
[18:59] Rather not only me, if Adeel will say this to mom then she will feel awkward.
[19:03] Are you getting my point?
[19:06] I don't know why Zara is calling him so much. He told me that Zara called him yesterday.
[19:11] She told him that if I can talk to my parents despite being a girl then why can't you talk to your parents being a boy?
[19:17] I don't know why is she in such a hurry?
[19:20] Anyways, don't worry.
[19:22] I will teach everything to Zara when she will come here.
[19:25] About norms of this house.
[19:29] Don't worry. Take rest. I am cooking food for you.
[20:06] Let's discuss about marriage. Right? So, tell me brother.
[20:11] What is your daughter's order?
[20:14] Which date has been fixed by her for her marriage?
[20:18] What nonsense Farida?
[20:20] What kind of discussion is this?
[20:28] What did Saad tell you about his stay there?
[20:34] Brother Saad told me that he will be back in a day or two.
[20:37] But I think it will take some more days.
[20:41] What is happening in your in-laws house?
[20:45] That he had to go so suddenly?
[20:48] I don't know mom, brother was in so much hurry.
[20:51] He and uncle Manzoor have gone there to see Mirha.
[20:57] But she got accident two days ago.
[21:01] Yes. Mom, I think there is something else.
[21:06] Maybe
[21:08] Maybe they want to fix Zara's marriage.
[21:13] Maybe. I think so.
[21:17] Anyways
[21:18] Saad will tell us when he will come back.
[21:23] Do I serve dinner for you?
[21:26] What have you cooked?
I have cooked potato with meat.
[21:30] OK
[21:33] I will eat a bit later.
[22:01] There is a difference between environments of your house and our house.
[22:06] In our house it is not considered good to discuss such matters with elders.
[22:09] I am sorry if you mind but you shouldn't have discussed that with me.
[22:20] I don't know why Zara is continuously calling Adeel? He told me that she called him yesterday.
[22:25] She told him that if I can talk to my parents despite being a girl then why can't you talk to your parents being a boy?
[22:31] I don't know why is she in such a hurry?
[22:57] Now you want update. Be patient.
[23:01] We will fix your marriage.
[23:03] Saad stop this nonsense.
[23:05] Tell me about your travel. Didn't you get any problem. Is dad alright?
[23:09] Oh really? So are you still concerned about your dad.
[23:12] Ask about me, I have also traveled.
[23:15] You are a superman. So you must be alright.
[23:17] By the way, where is dad. I am calling him but he isn't receiving my call.
[23:22] He must be taking rest in other room
Have you eaten food?
[23:26] We ate food on the way.
[23:27] It is said that we shouldn't eat in our daughter's in-laws' house.
[23:34] What's the matter? You look so happy.
[23:36] Won't you tell your friend?
Oh, so I tell you everything.
[23:39] I will charge rupees 550 separately for this spy work. I am telling you upfront.
[23:43] Hey Saad you are so mean. Tell me about Mirha. Is she feeling better now?
[23:49] Yes she is feeling better now.
[23:51] She was asking about you. She thought that you will come with us.
[23:54] Saad, don't divert the topic.
[23:57] Tell me the truth.
[23:58] Who told you that I am lying to you?
[24:01] When you don't want to tell the real thing then you divert the topic. 
[24:06] Now tell me the truth.
[24:08] OK, if that is the case then the truth is I am going to get fresh. I am very tired.
[24:14] Saad listen.
No, I won't listen.
[24:17] Aren't you my friend?
No.
[24:19] Aren't you my best friend.
No, I don't know you.
[24:23] Then go to hell.
[24:25] Well I am in there.
[24:27] Now where do I go?
Saad listen to me.
[24:30] Bye, we will talk later.
Saad.
[24:35] He is a very rude boy.
[24:40] I don't know what is going on there?
[24:55] Brother Manzoor, I was waiting for you to awake
[24:59] If I remember correctly then It's been more than a year since we last met with each other.
[25:06] Yes you are right.
[25:08] When we used to live in same city earlier then we met with each other but now
[25:15] But there is so much distance between Hyderabad and Karachi that we can't do anything.
[25:21] There is no such thing brother.
[25:24] If someone wants to meet then he finds a way to meet.
[25:30] Rather meeting itself is a way to meet with each other.
[25:34] Yes you are absolutely right.
[25:36] Meeting doesn't need any excuse.
[25:38] Excuses are needed if we don't want to meet.
[25:41] Just like we wanted to meet Mirha then you told us that she is sleeping.
[25:45] And when uncle wanted to meet us then you told him that we are sleeping.
[25:48] What are you trying to say?
[25:50] Was mom making excuses to stop you meeting with her. Was she lying?
[25:54] What are you talking about? Let them take tea after that they will sit with Mirha
[26:02] Anyway
[26:04] It's not that important for them to know about Mirha's condition, 
[26:08] let's talk about that matter for which Zara has sent them here.
[26:14] Let's discuss about marriage. Right?
So tell me brother.
[26:19] What is your daughter's order?
[26:22] Which date has been fixed by her for her marriage?
[26:26] What's this nonsense Farida?
[26:28] What kind of discussion is this?
[26:31] I am not telling you any lie.
[26:33] He is sitting in front of you, ask him the reason of his visit. 
[26:37] Have you come here to fix the date. Right?
Well.
[26:41] Take your mother from here immediately.
[26:45] Why? Why do I go from here?
[26:49] Will my son's marriage discussion be done without me?
[26:53] It's enough. They have made all plans behind my back.
[26:58] Now what do you want to discuss, discuss in front of me.
[27:02] Farida, if you will say a single word then no one will be worse than me.
[27:07] Dad, what happened to you?
[27:09] Even you are scolding mom.
[27:11] Mom's objection is absolutely right. Adeel is mom's son.
[27:15] Will Zara decide everything on her own?
Hold on.
[27:19] What's wrong if Zara talked about her marriage?
[27:23] And aunt tell me, didn't Adeel talk about his marriage ever.
[27:28] Ask me, I am also a boy.
[27:30] I also talk about my marriage even in a jolly mood.
[27:33] If boys can talk about their marriage then why can't girls do that?
[27:37] This is not a big thing that you are reacting like this.
[27:39] It's not a big thing for you but it's a very big thing for my mother.
[27:43] And tell me one thing, it's a matter among both our families.
[27:47] So I don't want any third person interfere in this matter.
[27:53] My son, don't interfere.
[27:57] Go to your room.
[27:59] No, no one will go anywhere.
[28:02] I am the bad person.
[28:05] I am going. All of you sit and finalize all matters.
[28:09] But also finalize this thing that will you invite mother of groom in his wedding or not.
[28:17] I am afraid that the way father has arrived here to fix his daughter's marriage on her wish
[28:24] Someday she can come here as well.
[28:27] She is so impatient to get married. She has no shame and dignity. 
[28:32] Finalize everything among yourselves.
[28:55] Brother Manzoor, I apologize on her behalf.
[29:02] She says without thinking.
No problem brother.
[29:07] It's alright.
[29:35] Zara please sit down. Why are you so anxious?
[29:39] I don't know why my heart is pounding.
[29:45] Have you talked to Saad?
Have you talked to him?
[29:49] Yes.
[29:51] I talked to him. He said that they are coming back.
[29:56] So quickly. They reached there in the evening.
[30:00] Zenny, has something happened there?
[30:02] Yes, he told me that they are on the way and they must be arriving here soon.
[30:09] But why didn't Saad tell me? Why isn't he receiving my calls? I am calling him continuously.
[30:13] By the way, didn't you talked to brother Adeel?
[30:24] What happened?
[30:28] Have you discussed with brother Adeel?
[30:30] He is not at home. He is in hospital.
[30:36] It's OK. Don't cry like this.
[30:40] Let them come.
[30:42] Then we will know the real story.
[30:44] Hopefully, nothing bad must have happened.
[30:47] But why are dad and Saad coming back?
[30:49] And why didn't Saad tell me anything?
[30:52] Something has happened there Zenny.
[30:55] Please Zara, control yourself.
[30:58] If God wills, nothing bad must have happened there. Don't worry.
[31:04] Please stop crying.
[31:11] Everything will be alright.
[31:18] You should tell me about my worth in this house.
[31:25] Do you even consider me as a human
[31:28] I have only one son.
[31:32] And if you will throw me away like a garbage in his marriage
[31:37] Then what else can I do except to get angry.
[31:40] Am I a stone or a plastic thing?
[31:45] Where are you going?
[31:48] Tell me about your discussion with them.
[31:51] What promise have you made to them?
[31:56] Mrs. Farida.
[31:58] It would be better for you to shut your mouth.
[32:04] Otherwise if I will have to chose between you and my son's happiness then that will not be a difficult one for me.
[32:15] What? What are you saying?
[32:19] Are you listening Mahi?
[32:20] Ask him, what has he said?
[32:23] I have been tolerating with your rudeness since last thirty two years.
[32:29] And if I have said anything to you for the first time then don't take my words lightly.
[32:35] Take me very seriously.
[32:38] Adeel is my son.
[32:41] And I will have to build his house for his happiness by demolishing this house
[32:47] Then I won't think even once.
[32:52] Do you understand?
[34:10] Greetings dad.
[34:30] Saad, what's the matter?
[34:33] Why isn't dad saying anything? What was discussed there?
[34:36] Go in.
[34:38] Why? Why are you so quiet? What happened there?
Go in.
[34:44] Saad tell me what happened there, why is dad so quiet?
I will tell you
[34:59] What happened Mr. Manzoor. Tell us.
[35:03] Is everything alright?
[35:07] Dad, please take rest.
[35:10] We will talk to him in the morning.
[35:12] Dad, are you alright?
[35:15] Are you feeling alright? Where is Saad?
He is there.
[35:20] Why are you tormenting yourself. Tell us as well. We will share your burden.
[35:29] Saad.
[35:31] Why aren't you saying anything? What happened there?
[35:36] Has something happened there
[35:39] Saad why are you doing this? Dad is also very quiet.
[35:45] The way dad looked at me, that is not normal.
[35:49] Your behavior is not normal as well.
[35:51] Your relation with Adeel is not normal, your in-laws are not normal and nothing is normal.
[35:58] But there is no point in making you understand.
[36:02] Saad.
Look at this. Just leave me.
[36:06] I have nothing to tell you.
Saad.
[36:09] Tell us what happened. Even dad isn't telling us anything.
[36:12] Didn't uncle and aunt say something?
[36:17] Didn't Mahi misbehaved with you?
[36:20] Why aren't you telling us anything? You have come back early as well.
[36:24] Saad, come quickly, dad is not feeling well. We have to take him to hospital right now.
[36:29] What happened to dad?
[36:30] I don't know.
[36:33] Maheen, what happened to dad?
[36:35] Pray to God that nothing may happen to dad 
[36:38] because if anything happens to him then I won't spare you.
[36:58] Did you see, how did he give me threat of divorce?
[37:04] Did you ever see or listen in your life that any father-in-law may have divorced his wife because of his daughter-in-law.
[37:14] I didn't hear about daughter-in-law
[37:16]  but I have seen so many divorces because of sisters.
[37:20] What do you mean by that?
I mean
[37:23] That do you think that dad have threatened you because of his daughter-in-law?
[37:27] What happened to you? Don't you know?
[37:30] Dad can do anything to become nice in front of his sister and he can go to any extent.
[37:36] And I can tell you with certainty
[37:38]  that if Zara wasn't his niece then dad would have never said that to you.
[37:42] Then go to hell both his sister and niece.
[37:49] What do you think that I will sit quietly?
[37:54] I won't sit quietly.
[37:57] What does he think that he will scare me and I will be scared?
[38:01] He has threatened me. Right?
[38:05] Now see what I will do.
[38:07] Zara can't come to this house without my consent.
[38:12] You are talking foolishly mom. 
[38:15] What do you think that you will argue with dad and he will agree with you?
[38:19] They are very strong.
[38:22] And dad has already told you about his decision.
[38:27] It's OK then.
[38:28] OK, let Adeel tell me about his decision.
[38:32] Call him, let me ask him about his decision.
What's wrong with you?
[38:39] There is no point in discussing this matter with Adeel.
[38:41] Rather it's useless to discuss this matter with anyone.
[38:46] Why don't you understand that you were not part of this game since beginning.
[38:52] When your consent was not there in that proposal.
[38:55] So how will your consent matter in marriage.
[38:58] So it's useless to argue on this matter.
[39:04] So what should I do? Should I keep quiet and watch everything.
[39:09] I can't do that. I won't accept defeat.
[39:14] Who is asking you to sit quietly and watch everything.
[39:18] But you can make a fuss by sitting quietly. Right
[39:23] You are out of this game now so enter this game again.
[39:29] But you will enter this game when Zara will come to this house.
[39:35] It would be good if you understand.
[39:39] Your anger will only hurt you not anyone else.
[39:44] Are you getting my point?
[39:48] Anyways, I am going to sleep. I am very tired. Wake me up after a while.
