[00:15] I went to meet him on the gate but he was not there.
[00:19] When I opened the door those robbers entered the house.
[00:25] Was he with those boys? Is he a robber?
[00:27] No Mahi, he was not there.
[00:30] I shouldn't have talked to you in that tone.
[00:35] Saad, at least you can forgive your friend.
[00:39] Shall I bring flowers for you?
[00:42] Yes please, the ones which are in fashion these days.
[00:50] Zara, is everything alright?
[03:20] Yes, I am here.
[03:23] OK. Good bye.
[03:32] How are you?
[03:36] What are you doing here?
[03:38] I was feeling suffocated in there so I came out for smoking.
[03:43] I can't sit in women gathering.
[03:46] Yes, I know that.
[03:50] And
[03:54] Hey.
[03:56] It's a family function. So please be careful.
Oh, sorry. 
[04:03] Thank you.
[04:28] Are you going back? OK.
[04:30] Wait. Good bye.
[04:39] Did you enjoy?
[04:45] No.
[05:00] How are you?
[05:03] Fine
[05:29] Zara, did you see?
[05:32] Mahi intentionally dropped that dish.
[05:36] She can't see your happiness.
[05:45] Look, I don't know what are you thinking about me at the moment.
[05:50] She can't bear this Zara.
[05:53] So
[05:55] You are intentionally pushing yourself towards that hole.
[05:59] You have still time to think about it.
[06:02] You have still time to make a right decision.
[06:06] Adeel is with me.
[06:08] He will handle Maham.
[06:10] Maham has done that intentionally, why don't you ask about it.
[06:14] I will ask.
[06:16] I will definitely ask if she will say anything to me.
[06:21] Aren't you afraid Zara?
[06:26] No.
[06:27] OK then, do whatever you want to do. If you don't care about yourself then why am I worried about you?
[06:47] Are you blind? Can't you see?
I am not blind but I can't see what is happening right now.
[07:02] What is the compulsion of your job?
[07:04] It's your sister's marriage, everyone was asking about you. Why can't you come here?
[07:09] As I told you that I couldn't come because I didn't have any leaves. Anyways, dad informed me very late.
[07:13] Yes, you are right.
[07:15] Everything happened so quickly.
[07:17] We didn't even know till last week that we will be attending Zara's wedding this week.
[07:21] Yes, you are right.
[07:24] Anyways, I will come tomorrow.
[07:26] I will reach by tomorrow evening.
[07:28] If God wills.
[07:30] I missed you so much.
[07:33] I always miss you.
[07:35] You are coming so late. You have neither prepared nor you have done any shopping so what will you wear on wedding.
[07:41] You don't have anything to wear that's why I asked you to come a bit early and would do some shopping.
[07:48] Boys don't do such shopping.
[07:51] I will manage.
Tell me about your preparation.
[07:55] No, I haven't done anything. I am waiting for you. I will go for shopping with you when you will come.
[07:59] I want to wear something as per your choice.
[08:02] OK, I will take you to shopping tomorrow. Take care.
[08:07] OK, take care.
[08:10] Good bye.
[08:36] Remember one thing my child.
[08:41] Your father is alive.
[08:44] And your house is in tact.
[08:47] Don't tolerate with anyone's cruelty.
[08:51] The doors of this house will always remain open for you.
[09:18] Sarwat, meet your daughter.
[09:46] Don't worry, she is going to her own house.
[09:53] You meet her as well.
[10:44] Go with Zara.
[11:02] Well, you got married now.
[11:08] You did what you wanted to do.
[11:12] Let me go, I am so tired and I have to take rest.
[11:19] By the way, you didn't do right Adeel.
[11:22] You hurt your mother's feelings.
[11:25] You will never live happily.
[11:28] Let's go, will I have to give you invitation.
[11:34] My child, don't mind their words.
[11:39] Give them some time, they will be alright.
[11:43] May God always bless both of you.
[12:03] Don't worry, I will correct everything.
[12:12] Let me talk to her.
[13:42] Maham, what are you doing? Maham.
[13:48] Leave me, what are you doing Maham?
[14:00] Adeel.
[14:22] What happened to you? Why are you so scared?
[14:26] Where were you?
I was making noodles for me.
[14:32] Did you watch any dream?
That was a very bad dream.
[14:38] I am so scared.
Who gets scared by watching a dream?
[14:43] But I am scared. Recite some verses on me.
[14:48] OK, I will do that but first I will eat my noodles.
[14:53] Will you eat?
[14:56] By the way, what did you see in dream that you are so scared.
[14:59] Are you mad? We shouldn't tell others about our bad dreams.
[15:04] OK, don't tell me.
[15:06] But please, stop scaring.
[15:09] And try to sleep.
[15:11] If you won't sleep well then how will you look beautiful at your wedding function?
[15:22] Hey, please stop crying. That was just a dream.
[15:27] OK, let me recite verses. Please stop crying.
[15:37] Lie down, I will recite verses.
[16:31] Your dad wanted to share the half cost of Henna function.
[16:36] But I asked him why?
[16:39] Then he said that if we had to arrange the separate functions then we would have spent money on that.
What's wrong with you?
[16:44] They only decorated their lawn. There was not so much expense.
[16:48] And what's wrong with dad, why will he share the half expense.
[16:51] So tell this to your father and brother.
[16:56] Your dad is so keen to give everything to his sister.
[17:02] He did the same thing on Sarwat's marriage.
[17:06] He gave everything to Sarwat and that too in excessive quantity.
Really?
[17:14] It's OK then, let's see what aunt will give to Zara.
[17:18] Dad gave her so many things. Right?
[17:21] Now it's her turn to pay back.
Hey.
[17:24] She can't give that much.
[17:27] Her name is Sarwat.
[17:29] She can't give a minor things and you are talking about dowry.
[17:36] Didn't you see
[17:38] What did she do at Maheen's wedding.
[17:40] Oh God, I checked the bottom of pots, those were very sub standard.
[17:47] It looked as if she made those pots from oil canisters.
[17:52] I told her as well, I couldn't stop myself.
[17:57] And those blankets, even the shawls of Hyderabad are more warmer than those.
But aunt did the right thing mom.
[18:06] She knew that Maheen won't have to live there so she saved money.
[18:11] Tell me, did you talk to her in-laws?
[18:14] She is such a clever woman.
[18:19] She didn't say a single word.
[18:23] She is so mean, same like Sarwat.
[18:27] Hmm
[18:29] OK, you don't have to talk to her
[18:32] And if you talk to her then only praise Maheen in front of her.
[18:37] Are you getting my point?
[18:39] Go to hell. I don't care.
[18:42] Hey, we have to go to market tomorrow. It's a very tough task.
[18:49] Yes, it's very late. But let me tell you one thing.
[18:52] Time passes so quickly when we backbite against others.
Hey, this is not backbiting.
[18:58] It's a discussion between mother and daughter.
[19:00] If someone else will say that then it will be considered as backbiting, it's a discussion among us.
No, it's backbiting.
Stop this nonsense.
[19:09] Let me switch off the light.
Yes, switch off the light.
[19:13] Oh God.
[19:40] How are you?
I am absolutely fine. You surprised me.
[19:45] Mom, dad, Zara come quickly. Look who is here.
[19:49] Do you know, all of us were missing you so much.
I was also missing you so much.
[19:54] Tell me, have you brought all those things which I asked you to bring?
Things?
[20:00] I forgot to bring those.
You forgot.
[20:04] OK then you can't enter this house, you can leave this house immediately. Right now, right away.
[20:09] Listen to me Zenny.
Thank God.
[20:17] What a surprise.
How are you?
I am fine.
[20:21] Let's inform your dad. Bring your bag.
[20:26] He didn't even tell us.
Dad.
[20:30] Look who is here.
Greetings.
[20:35] Uncle, greetings.
Greetings.
[20:39] I am absolutely fine. Do you know, I waited for you so much and I missed you so much.
[20:44] I know that's why I have come here as soon as I got leaves.
[20:48] You did the right thing but now I won't let you go back quickly.
[20:52] OK boss.
[20:53] Bring a cup of tea for me.
Bring tea for brother and also serve lunch for him.
OK.
[21:00] Uncle, please sit.
[21:02] How was your journey?
[21:05] That was good, I didn't observe any tiredness because of excitement.
[21:09] It's a wonderful feeling to meet your family.
[21:13] And you did the right thing to come here, all of us were missing you so much.
Yes uncle. Where is Adeel?
[21:21] He has gone to saloon with his mother and sister.
[21:25] Well, he is groom but your aunt doesn't understand that.
[21:33] Oho, what a pleasant surprise.
[21:37] How are you?
I am fine.
[21:39] Greetings.
Greetings. How are you?
[21:42] Hey, you have put on some weight.
[21:45] I am just joking. You are a fit guy.
Hey dude.
[21:47] Sit.
[21:48] Now, everyone will feel happy because you are here.
[21:53] Tell me about your routine these days.
[21:56] I am searching job these days and mom is not feeling well.
[22:01] Don't worry, you will find a good job.
You did right to come here Saad.
[22:06] You have to do so many things.
[22:08] Have lunch first then you have to go to do that work.
OK aunt.
[22:12] Mom, where is dad?
[22:15] Your dad has gone to market. There are so many things to do for wedding preparations.
[22:20] Tell me about yourself.
[22:29] You are so fond of creating drama.
[22:33] So do my mimicry in front of everyone.
[22:38] Now, tell everyone.
[22:41] That aunt was apologizing like this.
[22:56] Will you give her this set.
[23:00] Don't ask me, if it's in my authority then I don't want to give her even a single stick.
[23:06] The more we will give her the more she will dominate us.
[23:13] Mom, can I take this one?
[23:16] Do whatever you want to do and let me free as soon as possible.
[23:20] OK, I am keeping this one.
[23:21] If dad and Adeel ask you then tell them that you will give her at Valima. Right?
[23:27] OK.
[23:28] Tell me where is that thing, that is the most important thing.
That is there. Let me bring that.
Bring that quickly.
[24:27] What happened? Stop, do you want to drink water?
What are you doing here?
[24:33] You needed my help so I came here to help you.
[24:36] I don't need anyone's help. Please go.
No, you need my help to drink water so let me give you.
[24:44] I don't want to drink water. Please go.
Just wait.
[24:48] Take it.
I don't want to drink water. Please leave.
[24:51] Don't you want to drink water?
[24:53] No?
No, please leave.
OK, let me drink it.
[25:01] OK, I am going. If you need any kind of help then you can tell me.
Please go.
[25:22] Ah.
[25:26] Are you OK?
[25:29] Yes, I am alright.
Do you need anything?
[25:34] Yes, I want to drink water.
OK, let me give you.
[25:46] It's enough.
[26:00] Do you want to drink more?
No, thanks.
[26:04] Tell me, how is it?
[26:10] It's so so.
[26:13] OK.
Let me see.
[26:21] Hmm.
[26:23] It's so beautiful just like you.
[26:29] What's this?
[26:32] My name is not written here.
[26:34] You didn't write my name.
[26:39] The names written by henna are erased.
[26:42] Because it's color erases someday.
[26:49] Then where did you write my name?
[26:52] On your heart.
Nowhere.
[26:57] Saad.
[27:00] Leave my hand. Everyone is watching.
No.
Saad.
[27:29] Look at this set, I have bought this set with my choice.
[27:33] By the grace of God.
[27:35] I could manage this much in a hurry.
[27:37] Please forgive me, if anything is left.
[27:41] No sister Farida, everything is so beautiful. And you don't have to show anyone.
[27:48] You have brought everything with love for your daughter. God will do better for her.
[27:53] What are you talking about Sarwat?
[27:56] We have to do this much because it's our tradition. It's not a foreign wedding.
[28:03] I had to do something. Right?
[28:10] Shaista.
[28:12] Look at this, how beautiful it is.
[28:16] Why are you showing them?
[28:20] Call your younger son-in-law, what is his name?
Saad.
[28:28] Yes Saad. Ask Saad to come here.
[28:31] I have brought a special gift for him. I will give him his gift first.
[28:37] After that I will show all other things.
Maheen, call Saad.
[28:43] Yes, call him quickly.
[28:59] Saad.
[29:02] Aunt Farida is calling you.
[29:04] She is calling me?
Yes.
[29:14] Where is Saad? Here he is.
[29:20] Greetings.
[29:23] Greetings.
[29:25] Greetings. So you are here.
[29:28] I was waiting for you very anxiously.
You were waiting for me.
[29:33] But why?
[29:34] She has brought a gift for you.
[29:39] Yes, I have brought a very special gift for you. You will like that so much.
[29:50] Give me that.
[30:00] Look at it.
[30:21] Did you like it? Hmm?
[30:25] You are so fond of creating dramas.
[30:30] So do my mimicry in front of everyone.
[30:35] Now tell everyone.
[30:38] That aunt was apologizing like this.
[30:49] No, you don't want to do that.
[30:53] OK, as you wish. So just show us your dance skills.
[31:08] Sister Farida, what are you doing?
[31:10] It's your dear friend's wedding so it's mandatory.
[31:18] Aunt, this is rude from your side.
[31:20] Hey, I am not rude, ask your brother.
[31:27] I saw him with my eyes that day.
[31:29] He was doing my mimicry in front of everyone by wearing scarf.
[31:36] That aunt apologizes like this so I am asking him to do the same thing now.
[31:41] I am not saying any new thing.
[31:48] Aunt, that was just a joke.
[31:52] Why are you taking that thing seriously.
[31:55] I am also joking my child.
[32:01] Did you mind my joke?
[32:04] OK, if you did mind that then let me apologize.
[32:08] Let me beg for forgiveness. Please forgive me.
[32:14] I made this mistake to defame your son-in-law.
[33:01] Did you like it? Hmm?
[33:05] You are so fond of creating dramas.
[33:09] So do my mimicry in front of everyone now.
[33:17] Now tell everyone.
[33:20] That aunt was apologizing like this.
[36:00] Zara, why didn't you say anything there?
[36:04] What does she think?
[36:06] That they can do anything. She misbehaved with him so much but we didn't say anything.
[36:12] Aunt Farida, misbehaved so much with Saad.
[36:20] Saad is very hurt because of her act.
[36:24] She shouldn't have done that.
[36:28] Aunt has taken revenge from Saad for that day.
[36:35] Yes, she was looking for this opportunity.
[36:39] Such people are so mean.
[36:41] I was telling mom, I knew that something was bubbling up in her mind.
[36:46] But no one listened to me. It's OK then, just bear with it.
[37:04] Zara, call Saad.
[37:08] He is so upset. Please.
[38:00] Can I come in?
Yes dad.
[38:05] Are you ready?
[38:07] Yes, I was packing my things.
[38:10] Are you happy?
[38:12] Yes dad.
[38:14] Stay happy always.
[38:21] I have brought all three of you with so much love and care.
[38:25] I have tried my best that there is no difference between Ali and you (sisters). I loved all of you in same manner.
[38:38] But you are my dearest daughter.
[38:43] Remember my one thing.
[38:47] The grievances may blind fold our relations.
[38:55] It's necessary to give importance to relations and by doing that bond of love is created in relations.
[39:04] You have to give respect to every relation that all grievances may remove.
[39:13] And your love and sincerity should remove all misunderstandings.
[39:21] I will try my best that you won't have any complaints.
[39:24] But remember one thing, if anyone misbehaves with you then you will tell me and you won't hide anything from me.
[39:31] Your father is alive.
[39:34] And he will always be there with you.
[39:37] Don't think that you are alone.
[39:41] I will remember every single word of yours.
[39:48] I will miss you so much.
[39:52] Please forgive me, I have hurt you so much.
[39:55] No my child.
[39:58] You have complete right on your father. Daughters don't apologize to fathers.
[40:06] Smile.
[40:13] Zara.
[40:15] Come with us, we have a surprise for you.
[40:18] Surprise.
[40:20] Don't ask. Let's go and see yourself.
[40:23] Go, they have arranged everything with so much love.
