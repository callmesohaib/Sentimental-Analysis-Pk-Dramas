[01:06] Ali I didn't go in the kitchen myself and even if I did, isn't it my home as well?
[01:11] Who told you it isn't your home?
[01:17] What does it mean then? She came and said it directly to my face.
[01:25] You know, its her habit.
[01:27] Its not about habits Ali. Whats wrong is wrong.
[01:36] She didn't let you cook. This doesn't mean she was showing you down.
[01:40] Ali, its not about cooking.
[01:42] Do one thing, tell Maheen, if she doesn't like me, she should at least tolerate me.
[01:50] At least she can do that.
[01:55] Dolly, you know Maheen's nature very well.
[02:00] You're expecting protocol from her and she'll not give you that.
[02:04] You should just stop thinking about it.
[02:06] What is it? You're asking me and not your sister. Nobody says anything to her.
[02:11] I didn't expect her.
[02:19] See, its no use talking to Maheen
[02:22] and I'm saying this because I've experienced it since childhood.
[02:27] She will not change herself. This is why I'm asking you.
[02:32] What do you mean she'll not change herself and you're asking me.
[02:35] Who am I? What is my worth in this house, Ali?
[02:39] However you are, you're my choice. Please stay like this always.
[02:48] I'm telling you. If someone tells me that I misbehaved later, I'll not hear anyone
[02:55] I know you'll not misbehave. Come on, have your food now.
[03:07] More rice?
No I'll have a flatbread.
[03:15] Zaini? Zara is expecting.
Really?
[03:21] Yes. She just called mom.
[03:26] This shouldn't have happened
[03:29] What shouldn't have happened?
[03:32] Zara shouldn't have been pregnant.
[03:36] Please, don't start again.
[03:39] Aren't you upset? Instead you have objections with me.
[03:43] If I'm saying this, there should be a reason behind it.
[03:48] What is the reason? Please tell me.
[03:50] Now you'll see. They'll not let Zara come here. They'll keep her there.
[03:57] And yes, it could be that they send her here after the child is born.
[04:04] Forever and they keep the child too.
[04:09] Where does all this get into your head?
[04:11] Mom is absolutely right. You don't think before you speak.
[04:16] Alright, don't trust me.
[04:18] But when all this happens in front of your eyes, then I'll ask you.
[04:22] Why don't you understand? They'll never let Zara stay there. You'll see.
[05:07] As if she had lesser problems earlier that now she's expecting.
[05:12] Whats wrong with you Adnan?
[05:14] You're calling her child a problem?
No. I'm not calling the child a problem.
[05:18] Its different for everyone. She has been widowed in such a young age.
[05:23] Who will now marry her in this condition? Who will accept her?
[05:26] Who told you she'll get married?
[05:30] And it is important for her to get married?
[05:34] God has blessed her with a child.
[05:37] Why does she need to trouble herself with marriage?
[05:40] What is the problem with your women? You don't understand anything. Listen to me with open ears.
[05:45] We can spend our life with our children but not our youth.
[05:50] We need a partner at every turn.
[05:56] What sort of things do you say for girls like your own daughters?
[06:01] How can someone say something like this. Its shameful.
[06:04] You have no shame and you're saying whatever comes in your mind.
[06:08] You mind think whatever I'm saying is nonsense but I'm not lying.
[06:23] Mom.. Mom, I'm going home. I'll come back in the morning.
[06:27] I'll come with you.
[06:29] Mom, what will you do at home? Dolly is here as well. You stay too.
[06:32] Then why are you going?
[06:35] Mom, I couldn't sleep well for a few days. I want to go home.
[06:42] Saad, what are you hiding from me?
[06:45] There's something.
[06:47] Tell me what is it. I'm watching. You've been silent for two days.
[06:52] I feel you and Zaini are strained.
[06:56] What happened between you two? Both of you are worried.
[06:59] Its nothing. I don't know why you're feeling this. Everything is normal between us.
[07:04] Not only me even Dolly is feeling this.
[07:07] Mom, Dolly keeps saying stupid things.
[07:10] Alright, I accept if you're saying nothing is wrong. But remember this.
[07:17] If relationships are strained, the sooner you solve the problems, the better.
[07:23] Do you understand?
[07:26] Yes mom.
[07:29] Mom, I'm leaving now.
Alright dear.
[07:34] And if you need anything, let me know.
Alright. Take care of yourself. Bye.
[07:40] Bye.
[07:52] Mom, I feel anxious.
[07:58] Dear, there's nothing to feel anxious about.
[08:02] Why are you crying?
Even you're crying. Why are you crying?
[08:10] I'm not crying. I just have flu. I'm very happy.
[08:15] You've given such a good news.
[08:18] You need to take care of yourself. Your dad has given the same message.
[08:23] Mom, I miss Adeel very much.
[08:27] He shouldn't have died. He should have been with me.
[08:36] Are you listening, mom? Mom..
[08:43] Yes my child.
[08:46] I'm listening to you. Just stop crying now.
[08:51] Yes and take care of yourself.
[08:58] Yes.
[09:00] Worrying in this condition is not good for you.
[09:04] I'm here, I'll pray for you.
[09:10] May God take care of you, my child..
[09:59] I also told her, I'd listen to Aquib and stop talking to her.
[10:04] I don't know whats wrong with her? She talks nonsense these days.
[10:09] I've always found her this way.
[10:12] That's why I don't like you being friends with her.
[10:15] That's why I feel, she's jealous of us.
[10:20] Not us, just you. What problem will she have with me?
[10:25] I don't know. She said you were involved in the robbery in our house.
[10:30] And you called me to open the door downstairs.
[10:34] And then?
[10:35] Yes. I told her to shut up. I told her that you called me to meet you.
[10:42] Nothing more.
[10:44] She kept repeating that Aquib was involved in this.
[10:48] So what do you think? Should we make your friend believe this?
[10:51] What do you mean? I don't understand.
[10:54] I'm coming to your house to see you. Just one look.
[10:58] What? Are you mad? Don't come at this time.
[11:03] Now, I'll definitely come.
[11:05] Your friend thinks I'm a fool.
[11:07] So if she thinks you're a fool, will you be a fool and prove it to her?
[11:11] What are you saying Aquib?
[11:14] Mahi settled down with a lot of difficulty. If she finds out, it'll be a problem.
[11:19] What if the problem is solved?
I told you not to come.
[11:22] And I'm telling you I'll come.
Because of Sadaf?
[11:25] No. Because of myself. I'm nearby. I'll be there in ten minutes.
[11:30] Please, don't sleep. I'll text you. Come on the gate. Bye.
Aquib..
[11:47] What should I do about him? He has gone crazy.
[11:59] I thought I'd insult her and throw her out. But what happened?
[12:05] but what happened?
[12:08] All my game is destroyed.
[12:11] She was dad's favorite first and now mom is impressed after her.
[12:17] She seems to have forgotten everything and is looking after her now.
[12:24] She has just found out now.
[12:29] What will happen when this child is born?
[12:37] No. I won't let this happen.
[13:47] Mirha, where are you going at this hour?
No. Actually I,
[13:52] was checking the door if it was closed or not.
[13:55] Tell me the truth, what were you doing here.
[13:57] I'm telling the truth. I was scared that's why I came here to check the door.
[14:01] Looking at you, it seems you got scared when you saw me.
[14:04] I cannot do anything about what you feel
[14:09] Whose message is it?
[14:10] Why are you asking?
Stay here.
[15:04] Oh God. Why is Mahi always irritating me?
[15:07] She's always playing detective. What if she tells anyone?
[15:35] What were you doing?
[15:38] I was offering prayers. What happened Mirha? Is everything alright? Are you okay?
[15:43] I felt anxious so I came to your room.
[15:48] If you don't have any problem, can I sleep with you tonight?
[15:52] Of course. You can sleep. Its no problem.
Thank you.
[15:57] You sit here. I'm going to perform ablution?
[16:05] What did you think? I cannot come here?
[16:08] Why did he come here? You called him again?
I...
[16:13] Don't be loud. Zara will hear you.
[16:15] Shut up and come in my room immediately.
[16:18] You go. I'm coming.
Come to my room in 5 minutes.
[16:36] Who was it Mirha? Who were you talking to?
[16:38] It was Mahi. She wanted to talk.
[16:42] Mahi was here? What did she say?
[16:45] Nothing. You leave it. You know her. You'll not like it.
[16:50] You offer your prayers, I'll make tea.
[16:53] I wanted to have tea so we'll drink together now.
[16:57] You're hiding something from me Mirha?
[17:00] No. How can it be? How can I hide something from you?
[17:04] You offer your prayers, I'll make tea.
Tell me what is it?
[17:09] She said if I felt awkward, why didn't I go to her?
[17:15] Why did I come to you?
[17:19] Let it be. I told you, you wouldn't like it.
[17:23] You offer your prayers, I'll bring tea.
[17:26] Whatever you're hiding Mirha, nobody would like it when they hear about it.
[17:55] I have to remind you.
[17:58] You told me that there are problems in the house so I should remind you.
[18:05] When your father passed away, it was Zara's birthday a few days later.
[18:14] You brought cake for her and a gift.
[18:19] Even if it was small, you celebrated her birthday.
[20:24] You weren't even ashamed a little? Leave the thieves.
[20:29] Your brother passed away a few days ago. You're not ashamed at all.
[20:32] Why should I be ashamed? I just went to check the gate.
[20:37] Really?
[20:38] Who was on the bike who ran away as soon as he saw me?
[20:40] How would I know who he was?
[20:41] You should have stopped him and asked him who he was and why was he running away?
[20:45] Shut up or I'll give you a slap now.
[20:48] I'll go and tell dad right now.
[20:49] Go ahead and tell anyone you like. Say whatever you like.
[20:53] You've talked and Zara has heard as well.
[20:57] Whatever it is, right or wrong, let everyone know. And what do you think?
[21:03] Will Zara tell noting to her family? You didn't even think once before you blamed me?
[21:07] what did she say?
[21:08] She heard everything and I swore to her that whatever she heard was a lie
[21:14] but why would she believe me?
What did she say?
[21:17] Leave it be.
Why don't you tell me? What did she say?
[21:21] And Mahi I swear I don't know who he was. I just went down to check the gate.
[21:26] Why don't you tell me what Zara said?
[21:29] She said that she thought we were very respectable and her mom and Maheen were right.
[21:35] You got divorced because of this.
[21:39] Shut up. Zara can never say that.
[21:42] She would never say such a thing. It must be you.
[21:44] If you don't believe me, then don. Why did you ask me if you didn't want to believe me?
[21:50] You still believe her more than me. If so, go and ask her. What did she hear and what did she say?!
[21:56] Alright.
[21:58] I'll talk to her myself. You think about yourself.
[22:41] What happened Farida?
[22:43] You're crying.
[22:48] I'm missing Adeel.
[23:01] Be patient Fareeda.
[23:04] We can do nothing except being patient?
[23:11] I don't understand. What are God's secrets?
[23:21] He took away my son and now I have good news of being a grandma.
[23:33] I don't know, whether we should be happy or sad.
[23:40] I told you Farida,
[23:43] just be patient.
[23:47] There is something better for us in everything God does.
[23:54] We don't understand that.
[23:58] Be patient.
[24:01] I cannot be patient Ahmed. I cannot be patient anymore.
[24:30] It is great that you came. We wanted to get medicines for mom. Please you take me now.
[24:36] Tell me, I'll get it.
[24:37] You don't know about her medicines. We'll go and come in half an hour.
[24:42] I have to drop Zaini. You know I go everyday.
[24:45] Yes, you go everyday. Take me today.
[24:48] Wait for a while. I'll take you as soon as I get back after dropping Zaini.
[24:51] As it is, the market won't be open yet.
[24:53] Where do you want to go? Tell me. I'll take you.
[24:56] I need to get mom's medicines.
[24:58] Don't go anywhere. I'll take you myself when I come. Wait for a while.
[25:04] What happened? I was finding a solution.
[25:07] Saad minded it. Your wish.
[25:10] Zaini is here. How are you?
[25:14] Lets go.
[25:21] Listen, where are you going? What did I tell you about Saad?
[25:26] What did you say?
[25:27] Zaini has complete control over Saad. Did you see his face that day?
[25:32] She looked upset. As if she was angry.
[25:34] Uncle, her face is like that. She's always angry.
[25:38] Very good. You've become very funny. What is this?
[25:43] I'm not joking. I'm serious. She is like this.
[25:46] Learn something from Zaini. See how she has Saad following her everywhere. 
[25:50] You do something like that and get Ali under your control. You're  a beautiful girl.
[25:56] Don't worry Adnan uncle. I'll tell what I can do when time comes.
[26:01] Good. I expect this from you and you'll fulfill my expectations.
[26:07]  Did you call Zara?
[26:09] No.
[26:10] Why didn't you? You should call and congratulate her. 
[26:12] You'll have to show off otherwise it won't work.
[26:16] I'll do it later, whats the rush? I have to call Saad too.
[26:20] Alright. What did you want to get from the market. I'll get it myself.
[26:23] No. There's no need.
[26:25] What do you mean you don't need anything? Why did you stop Saad? Without any reason?
[26:29] I tried to stop him but he didn't need to stay.
[26:33]  I'll just look into the kitchen.
[27:03] Here is your breakfast?
[27:06] Why did you make breakfast, aunt?
[27:10] Oh, what happened? Can I not make breakfast for you?
[27:15] I was just coming.
[27:17] I slept late last night so I couldn't wake up on time.
[27:21] Its alright. Sit and have breakfast.
[27:24] It happens in this condition.. I know. You just need to rest.
[27:32] Its important to rest in these days. 
[27:36] And girls ask for a lot of pampering in such a condition.
[27:41] Especially girls like today. In fact, not only girls today. Ask your mom..
[27:49] I did so many dramas in my time. 
[27:55] Of course I did. Why are you looking at me like this? Ask your mother.
[28:03] God keep my mother in law in heaven, she didn't even let me stop down from the bed.
[28:09]  I'll also pamper you and look after you.
[28:17] Come on now. Have your breakfast. Eat your full. What are you thinking?
[28:26] Eat your breakfast. Eat your full. Do you know?
[28:35] I have also thought of a name for my grandchild.
[28:38]  I'll name my grandson, Adeel.
[28:45] I have faith it will be a son.
[28:48]  I saw a pious man in my dream,
[28:55] his hands were shining and he handed me a child wrapped in a white cloth.
[29:03]  I know it was a boy.
[29:07] You'll have a son and I'll name him Adeel.
[29:16] Now you have your breakfast. 
[29:18] I'll come in a while and check. You should have finished everything.
[29:59] Bye.
Zaini, stop being angry. 
[30:04] You didn't talk to me the entire way.
[30:09] What would I tell you?
[30:11] Anything you wanted. Did you ever ask me what to say earlier?
[30:16] Earlier, things were different. 
[30:20] Why do you object me not talking to you?
[30:24] I'll come to pick you up.
[30:26] We'll sit and talk somewhere.
[30:30] Bye.
[30:42] Irshad? Get the things.
Yes sir.
[30:44] Yes sir.
Dear,
[30:48] Did you call and tell your aunt?
I'll just tell her.
[30:53] When will she come by?
She'll be here in a day or two.
[30:57] A day or two? Alright. Its good.
[31:01] We'll spend two more days peacefully.
Uncle..
[31:07] You're...
I think your aunt heard us.
[31:12] Alright. Its Ahmed's call. Hello? Yes.
[31:19] Yes Ahmed, I was about to call you in a day or two. What? What did you say?
[31:27] How? How did it happen? Oh..
[31:32] Alright. Oh.. what can we say?
[31:38] Yes. Sure. Yes. May God fix everything. Yes.
[32:03] Oh, Zara what are you doing? You should have told me, I'd have set everything.
[32:09] You're not well. You can tell me.
[32:12] I'm absolutely fine Mahi, thank you.
[32:14] No you're not okay. Tell me everything. I'll manage everything. 
[32:19] Come on. Move now. Good girl.
Nothing is wrong with me, I'll do it.
[32:24] I wanted to request something.
[32:28]  Please help me.
[32:31] Did you see I was upset with Mirha when she was in your room?
[32:38] Yes.
[32:42] Do you know what? 
[32:45] Think if it had happened in front of Adeel. What would he have done?
[32:49] I don't understand.
[32:58] I am doubting Mirha.
[33:01]  I think she met someone last night.
Whom?
[33:05] A boy.  
[33:08] See Zara promise me. This will stay between you and me. It'll not go out.
[33:15] Mirha shouldn't know. Not your family. Not my family. 
[33:20] Promise me you won't tell anyone. 
[33:23] Do you know if Adeel was alive,
[33:27] he would have done anything to save the respect of our house. 
[33:32] You'll have to do that now.
[33:37] Please talk to Mirha
[33:39]  and ask her whats going on? 
[33:43] Will you talk to her?
[33:45] What should I ask Mirha?
[33:50] Promise me you'll not tell anyone. 
[33:53] You know Mirha takes me as her enemy.
[33:57] I told her lovingly that she should make me meet that boy. I'd meet him and talk to him.
[34:05] She didn't agree. 
[34:07] She's close to you and she listens to you. Get things out of her.
[34:13] Ask her whats going on? In fact I'd say you should meet that boy.
[34:17] Mahi, I'm not meeting anyone.
[34:21] I didn't mean that. Don't meet him. Whose asking you to meet? 
[34:28] But you can at least talk.
[34:32] I know she'll share everything with you. 
[34:37] Please don't say no. 
[34:41] Had Adeel been alive, he'd have done the same thing.
[34:47] But now since he's not here, you're in his place. 
[34:52] You have to handle everything.
[34:56] Promise me. You'll talk to her. Please.
[35:07] Thank you. 
[35:10] Should I help?
[35:12] No I'll do it.
[35:13] Its alright. I'll do it. 
[35:16] Thank you Zara.
[35:38] You didn't answer me.
[35:40] About what?
[35:42] As if you don't know. I told you to come back from Islamabad. Forever.
[35:49] Dolly, it isn't important..
It isn't important that you always say no to me.
[35:54] When did I always say no?
[35:57] I've never tried to make you agree. 
[36:00] I keep asking you to come back but you say no.
[36:07] Can I know the reason?
[36:08] As if you don't know.
[36:11] Dad says the same thing. I should live here.
[36:16] Alright. So, you'll listen to your dad and not me.
[36:26] I'm asking you something Ali.
[36:28] Dolly you know the answer.
[36:32] Really? Should I tell mom?
Right away?
[36:36] Of course, I need witnesses. What if you say no tomorrow? I don't trust you.
[36:42] I promise you. This time, I'm going to Islamabad for the last time.
[36:48] Promise?
[36:51] Promise.
Good decision.
