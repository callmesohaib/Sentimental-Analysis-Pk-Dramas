[00:13] Adeel and Zara have been married.
[00:16] What difference does it make brother?
[00:18] This is Adeel's aunt's home, he can come her anytime he wants.
[00:21] And he can leave whenever he wants.
[00:23] When he goes there, she'll sit with him and provoke him against us.
[00:28] What can I say to her when my own son doesn't give me any importance.
[00:34] As far as Zara is concerned, I'm sure she'll try to provoke him.
[00:38] If not today, then tomorrow.
[00:40] Your husband was a contractor, did you start doing the same work?
[00:47] He wasn't a contractor, he was a builder.
[00:51] He used to make buildings, but he was unable to make a home for himself.
[00:56] You taunted me, right?
[00:59] I will surely return the favor.
[01:01] But at the right time.
[01:09] Zara sit with them...
[01:13] I'll take care of this.
[01:14] I'll make this, you go and sit with them.
[01:17] I'm not going there, I've already greeted them...
[01:20] and I cannot tolerate Maham more than five minutes.
[01:23] Why did Adeel brought her with him?
[01:26] And you didn't refuse.
[01:27] She's his sister. How can I ask him not to bring his sister?
[01:31] So what if she's his sister. Don't give her so much importance only because she's his sister.
[01:35] She's his sister, but your sister-in-law.
[01:39] Lord knows how you will manage with these people?
[01:42] How much time will it take, everyone is waiting.
[01:45] And yes... sister Maria went to her room and asked for her tea there.
[01:51] Do you see? She does this on purpose.
[01:54] It's not like that, maybe she's tired. She traveled such a long way.
[01:59] She just wants to impose her importance.
She wants you to start catering to her needs.
[02:08] Please lower your voice. Zaini... I'll pour the tea for you to serve.
[02:13] I'm not taking the tea, you can take it yourself.
[02:16] Pour the tea, I'll take it to her.
[02:19] Why will you go? Zaini will take it.
Let her go.
[02:23] I'll give her the tea, that too without the biscuits. Give it to me.
[02:34] Zain could have served her...
Where's the tray?
[02:38] I've taken it, forget it. I'll serve it to her.
[02:44] Why didn't you go?
I have no intention of being insulted.
[02:54] Tell me, shall I take this?
Do whatever you want.
[03:08] Mother what can I say? No one even came to receive us
[03:13] And... your son is bending down in front of everyone like he's the daughter-in-law.
[03:18] I feel so weird. I wasn't an idiot for letting him leave.
[03:23] I'm his mother, I know my son well.
[03:27] You can write down my words, all his life he'll serve his in-laws.
[03:33] And when Zara comes here, she will rule over our house.
[03:37] Nothing is hidden from me. I know their family well.
[03:41] It is such a weird family, they still haven't served me tea.
[03:45] They know we traveled a long way and are tired. They should have arranged for the tea a while ago.
[03:51] There is no arrangement. I got up and left.
[03:55] Why would I listen to them?
Adeel has no respect in this house.
[04:01] How will it be? Why would they respect him?
[04:06] They don't know how to respect someone and Adeel...
[04:10] If he goes there frequently...
[04:12] and takes entire suitcases to their home like a porter, then he'll be treated like a porter.
[04:18] Son-in-laws aren't supposed to be this way.
[04:20] I forgot to tell you, Mahi is still home. I think she has been divorced.
[04:25] I don't care if she's divorced.
[04:28] Forget about her and tell me, did Zara meet your properly?
[04:32] Yes she did... but you never know what's going on in one's heart.
[04:41] Someone's at the door, I'll talk to you later. I'll call you later.
[04:45] Alright, but listen.
[04:48] You remember that thing that you were supposed to do, right?
Yes.. I do.
[04:53] Okay farewell.
[04:59] I asked you to sleep. Tea will only drive your sleep away.
[05:03] But tiredness was only an excuse to get tea.
[05:07] I know all your ploys, since I've been seeing them from our childhood.
[05:11] Here you are, have your tea.
[05:12] What kind of tone are you talking with me?
[05:16] The way you talked to me, do you remember?
[05:19] When I came to your home with my husband.
[05:23] I was your guest back then. Drink your tea!
[06:01] Come sit here...
[06:04] Don't sit here.
[06:17] Why won't he drink tea? Serve it to him.
[06:24] Tea...
[06:30] Take it.
[06:35] Brother Adeel you didn't eat anything. Take these biscuits.
[06:59] Do you want me to serve you something?
[07:01] Eat some cake, it's nice.
[07:05] Zara likes to eat this.
[07:08] Zara... my dear check on dinner.
[07:13] Sure
[07:15] Do you want my help?
[07:32] Here is your tea.
[07:39] Shaista.
[07:41] I'm telling you, this girl is dangerous.
[07:46] She's a firecracker ready to explode.
[07:51] Why should we care if she's a firecracker or a bomb?
[07:55] Her intentions aren't good. I'm telling you.
[08:00] You've recognized her intentions two minutes into meeting her. Amazing!
[08:09] I didn't meet her for two minutes, I was insulted for two minutes.
[08:14] You didn't see how she was talking.
[08:19] I don't assess anyone just by looking at them.
[08:22] All I know that she is an ill-mannered girl.
[08:28] I'm thinking of giving brother Manzoor the rent like we used to.
[08:34] What? Have you gone insane? Why should we pay the rent?
[08:40] If we're getting a chance to save money, then we should?
[08:42] What about that girl insulting us?
[08:47] How does that matter?
She's here as a guest and she'll leave soon.
[08:53] You are the one who said that we shouldn't care.
[08:56] We're saving money and we should keep it that way.
[08:58] Respect doesn't matter. Some days you have it some days you don't.
[09:03] It's a stupid thing to say that we should start paying the rent.
[09:25] Adeel...
[09:30] Adeel.
[09:53] Zara.
[09:59] What are you doing?
[10:00] I came here to take your clothes for ironing. Which ones should I take?
[10:07] What do you mean?
[10:10] Ever since I came here, you've been asking me to eat, or rest.
[10:14] And now you want to iron my clothes?
[10:19] Why don't you ever ask me to sit and talk with you?
[10:25] It doesn't seem nice.
[10:28] Talking on the phone is different, here everyone watches.
[10:33] Why doesn't it seem nice?
[10:36] We are married, we're not strangers.
[10:39] Still, it doesn't seem nice. Tell me... which clothes you'll wear.
[10:44] I'll iron it... the electricity will go out soon.
[10:47] What if I don't tell you?
[10:50] Then I'll choose for myself.
Should I iron this?
[10:55] Listen... I have something for you.
[10:59] What?
[11:01] Let me show you.
[11:07] What is this?
What's this, you ask..
[11:10] Let me show you.
[11:43] How do you like it?
Very nice.
[11:49] It looks even better on you.
[11:59] What's going on here!
[12:04] What do you mean?
[12:07] I brought a gift for Zara and I was giving it to her.
[12:10] You brought her a gift, but I don't see it.
[12:13] Where is it? Or do you not want to show it to me?
[12:19] It's not like that, Adeel gave me this locket.
[12:24] He didn't just give it to you, he put it on you as well.
[12:28] It's amazing to see how progressive you two have become.
[12:33] When I got married...
[12:35] I didn't talk to my husband in front of anyone for months!
[12:40] But I think this is just about one's morals. I was very shy.
[12:47] What tone are you taking with us?
[12:51] What tone? What did I say?
[12:54] Mother called me... I'll go and listen to her.
[13:01] What did you do?
[13:05] What was so wrong with me putting a locket on her?
[13:09] What did I do? I was talking about myself. I didn't say anything to her.
[13:13] I said that I was shy when it came to doing such things.
[13:19] What did we do that you are trying to insinuate?
[13:37] Wait Zara... where are you off to in such a hurry?
[13:42] Where is the groom? I want to meet him as well.
[13:44] Adeel is a little busy, you can see him later.
[13:48] Oh hello! Let him know that he can't stay busy here.
[13:53] It's not like we're free! I'll meet him myself.
[13:56] Saad, you won't go in his room.
[14:01] What happened?
[14:05] Nothing, come with me.
Something did happen.
[14:08] You seem upset. It's nothing.
[14:11] I'm not upset.
[14:13] Why are you asking the same question again and again?
[14:15] What's your problem?
[14:19] Something is up.
[14:21] Did Adeel say something to you?
[14:29] You know... that I can tell when you're lying.
[14:34] Why do you lie to me then?
[14:37] Now tell me, otherwise I'll ask Adeel.
[14:39] Saad, I said that you won't go into his room.
[14:46] You won't listen to me... come with me...
Let go of my hand Saad!
[14:52] Tell me...
[14:57] I went to Adeel's room to get his clothes.
[15:00] He brought me a gift, this locket.
[15:04] He was putting it on me and his sister saw me.
[15:08] And she said some weird things.
[15:11] Then I left.
[15:19] Saad...
[15:22] I've told you something serious and you're laughing.
[15:31] You should have thought of that before being romantic.
[15:34] Anyone could have walked in on you guys.
[15:36] I didn't go there to be romantic. I went there to get his clothes.
[15:41] And because of that you had to suffer the consequences.
[15:42] Saad, for once can your try being serious?
[15:45] You know that Mahi, she'll just exaggerate the story
[15:50] She likes making mountains out of molehills.
[15:54] Let her... what will you do? We're here.
[15:59] Why are you worried?
[16:01] Technically, Adeel should have taken a stance for you.
[16:04] But he's scared of his sister.
[16:08] I'm so worried and you're joking.
[16:12] Talk about Adeel respectfully...
[16:15] I will not tolerate anything disrespectful against him.
[16:18] I'm just kidding... when have I ever been rude?
[16:23] You should respect Adeel.
[16:27] And listen...
[16:29] What?
Forget it... there's no point.
[16:33] Listen to me... Zara listen to me.
[16:36] It's good, I caught you. If only I had asked for something else as well.
[16:40] I need to run some errand, bring your motorcycle around.
[16:43] Why don't you go yourself?
[16:44] What do you mean? What are you doing here?
[16:46] I'm sure you must be talking Zara. Come on.
[16:51] Come on!
[16:53] Come on!
[17:00] If you're talking about respect and manners,
[17:01] then tell me, what kind of manners teaches you to enter one's room without knocking?
[17:07] You're calling me manner-less because of Sarah?
[17:10] Your older sister.
No.
[17:13] I didn't say that at all. I am just asking you what kind of manners these are.
[17:18] You're being so rude to me and she hasn't even come to our home.
[17:23] What will you do when she finally arrives.
[17:25] I'm not saying this because of Zara, I'm saying it because of me.
[17:29] You insulted Zara after you insulted me.
[17:33] And please... stop this... we are at my in-laws home, what will they think?
[17:39] So, what you're trying to say is that you are being embarrassed because of me.
[17:44] I didn't say that at all.
[17:46] Why do you always present things in your favor?
[17:48] Enough, I've done as much as I could have.
[17:52] I want to go home, buy my tickets.
[17:55] What do you mean?
[17:57] I'm telling you that you will not go anywhere.
[18:01] I don't understand.... you've insulted me in front of her.
[18:05] You humiliated me...
[18:07] someday she'll argue with me... with mother... with father.
[18:12] You've left me no respect in front of her.
[18:15] Zara is not disrespectful to anyone.
[18:18] If it were like this, then she would have surely answered you, but she left.
[18:23] Alright fine... look at my hands. Forgive me.
[18:27] I wasn't saying it about her... I was talking about how I used to get shy.
[18:33] And if you still don't believe me, I'll go and apologize to her as well.
[18:38] I'm not asking you to apologize.
[18:45] Sister, please...
[18:48] Look at me... I apologize to you on Zara's behalf.
[18:51] No need for this.
[18:53] There is no need to apologize. Get me my ticket. I'll go home today
[18:57] You will not go anywhere. I will not get you tickets.
[19:00] Fine.. I'll buy them.
[19:02] That will not happen.
It will.
[19:06] You embarrassed me in front of her.
[19:24] Zaini... Zaini. Get up!
[19:29] Zaini get up...
What is it? Let me sleep.
[19:32] Zaini get up... I want to talk to you.
[19:35] What is it, I'm listening.
[19:37] Get up...
I'm listening... it's not like I'm dead.
[19:41] Tell me, what is it? I'm listening.
[19:44] Forget it... I don't want to talk to you.
Okay.
[19:47] Thank you... please go.
[19:52] Zara... how dare you!
[19:56] She doesn't even let me sleep.
[20:04] Zara's in-laws are so far away. She can't come here daily from Hyderabad.
[20:10] If you are so wise... then why weren't you so wise when it came to you?
[20:16] I mean... husband and wife fight with each other every other day.
[20:20] You returned home in two days.
[20:32] Mother, what can I say?
[20:35] There was no respect. On the contrary she told me...
[20:39] that Adeel had gifted her a locket.
[20:43] Really... was the locket gold, or artificial?
[20:47] What are you saying?
[20:49] I just saw it... I didn't feel it to check if it was gold, silver, or artificial.
[20:54] Whether it be gold or artificial, nowadays they are of the same price.
[20:57] It seemed branded to me.
To hell with her!
[21:02] She will sell my son!
Your son is no less.
[21:08] She insulted me in front of her!
[21:12] Not once did he think that I was his elder sister.
[21:16] I begged in front of your son.
[21:19] What?
[21:22] What are you doing over there?
[21:25] You made some bold claims before you left...
[21:27] that you will return with good news, but you're apologizing in front of them.
[21:33] What I did was right...
[21:35] I did it so that Adeel takes my side, instead of Zara's.
[21:40] You know what they say... it's easier to catch more flies with honey.
[21:45] I don't understand. If he's so crazy in love with that girl...
[21:52] then why would he care if you beg in front of him.
[21:55] Leave that to me.
[21:58] You have only one thing to do. Find a girl of lower status for Adeel.
[22:02] So that she may always be under your thumb.
[22:06] May God bless you.. you've made me very happy.
[22:12] Tell me about your auntie.
[22:14] Forget about her...
[22:17] My main focus are Zara and Adeel. I'll deal with her later.
[22:23] Listen, I'll talk to you later.
[22:25] Let me check how Zara is exaggerating things.
[22:30] You understand, right?
She will not say anything.
[22:34] She will hide things... she's clever like her mother.
[22:39] What will she say about what she was doing with Adeel in his room?
[22:43] I will be the one to tell her that. Let me go and check.
[22:47] Whatever you do, think before doing it. Understand?
[22:51] They aren't engaged... they are married.
[22:55] We don't want her sending her away here.
[23:00] Will you be able to stop your father and brother?
[23:03] Yes... I didn't think about that.
That's why I say...
[23:09] think before you do something... otherwise, things might fall on your head.
[23:16] I'm growing fearful of you.
No need to fear, I'll update you.
[23:22] Listen, I'm reminding you, don't mention this to anyone.
[23:28] We will regret it...
Alright, I understand.
[23:32] Don't worry... it's my job to worry them. I'll talk to you later, farewell.
[23:37] Farewell.
[24:01] Looking at you, it doesn't seem that you've lived abroad for a long time.
[24:05] Abroad everyone used to tell me that I didn't look like someone from Pakistan.
[24:09] I become like the place I reside.
[24:13] Then... when are you returning?
[24:17] Why?
[24:19] What does my return has to do with you?
[24:21] You said that you were here for two months.
[24:25] It's been two months, that's why I asked.
[24:27] Your auntie loves me dearly...
[24:32] It's hard to be away from someone when you love them.
[24:35] You love Zara and won't it be hard for you when she leaves for Hyderabad?
[24:42] What do you mean?
What does this have to do with Zara?
[24:47] I know you two love each other and are good friend.
[24:50] I've overheard you two on a few occasions.
[24:53] Zara is only my friend.
[24:56] There is no love between us.
That's what I'm saying.
[25:00] I'm talking about the love that come with friendship.
[25:03] I know there isn't anything between you two. It's just friendship.
[25:10] Quickly finish this. I have to return.
[25:14] Don't be so hasty... leave that man and his wife alone.
[25:18] I have some work that I need to do.
[25:20] Sit down... we'll leave as soon as this finishes.
[25:24] Have some milk and jalebi.
[25:27] You'll feel strong.
[25:29] No?
I don't want to eat it.
[25:32] Drink your tea then.
[25:46] These kids came here alone.
[25:50] If one of their parents had come, we would have sent her away.
[25:57] Will they mind?
[26:01] Maham's attitude seem very strange to be this time around.
[26:05] This time around? She's always had a sharp tongue.
[26:14] You don't understand what I'm saying.
[26:19] Did she say something?
[26:21] She doesn't need to. One's behavior can speak a lot.
[26:27] Sister Faheeda didn't talk much as well.
[26:33] She had never been one to speak much. That's not a big deal.
[26:37] Look how happy Adeel is...
[26:39] It won't matter if he's the only one who's happy.
[26:42] It's something that the entire family should look forward to,
[26:47] What's the matter? Are you hiding something from me? Did something happen?
[26:51] I'm not hiding anything. I'm just saying...
[26:56] It just seems strange to me.
[26:58] Are you speaking the truth?
[27:01] Have I ever lied to you?
[27:07] Never hide anything from me when it comes to our girls.
[27:12] My daughters are my strength.
[27:16] Never try to make me weak by keeping me in the dark.
[27:22] When it comes to children, women who hide things from their husband...
[27:26] are inconsiderate towards their husband. 
[27:29] I can never do that to you.
[27:33] Then tell me, why did you say this?
[27:36] I'm telling you... things seem weird to me...
[27:42] It seems that Adeel forced her to come here. She's not happy.
[27:46] You're thinking that for no good reason.
[27:49] Whether its Maheen or Maham... both of them are the same.
[27:54] They create problems out of thin air.
[27:57] Why are you after Maheen?
 I've told you not to!
[28:01] What do you mean? Think about it yourself...
[28:03] Both of their names start with 'm' 
[28:05] and I've decided that if ever a child is born in this family, their name won't start with 'm'.
[28:10] What about you? What does your name start with Mr. Manzoor?
[28:15] With an 'm'.
Yes!
[28:20] What do you have to say now?
[28:23] Always keep smiling like this.
[28:24] You look very bad when you're rude...
No, I look very nice.
[28:30] No...
Yes, I even look nice in a bad mood.
[28:47] Where's Zara?
Why are you looking for her?
[28:50] I wanted to drink tea.
[28:53] But then I forgot Adeel has gone to a home where there is a wedding.
[28:58] So Zara will not leave her room.
[29:01] For your information...
[29:03] Zara is out somewhere with Adeel.
[29:08] A wedding?
[29:10] It's possible she made an excuse to go somewhere else.
[29:15] Why? Didn't Adeel tell you?
[29:20] It's good... husband and wife should spend time together.
[29:26] This will they'll get to know each other. Otherwise, small things can start fights.
[29:32] Zara's in-laws live so far away. It's not like she can come here daily from Hyderabad.
[29:37] If you are so wise, then why weren't you so smart when it came to you?
[29:43] I mean, husband and wives with each almost every other day.
[29:47]  Why did you come back home after two years?
[29:50] Are you taunting me with divorce?
[29:51] No, I'm just answering your taunt.
[29:55] I couldn't let you leave empty handed... that would have been disappointing...
[30:00] And I'm not one for disappointing guests.
[30:04] Do you want tea, or will you wait for Zara?
[30:09] No need.
[30:29] Zara, I will not try to hide...
[30:32] anything from you, or misguide you.
[30:37] Sister Maheen is like this.
[30:40] She likes bothering others.
[30:44] But Adeel, don't you think it's your mistake?
[30:49] I just came to your room with clothes.
[30:52] This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't stopped me.
[30:56] Something would have happened.
[30:59] Something would have happened... and this would have happened.
[31:07] Come home with me.
[31:11] We'll live a long with each other.
[31:15] I want you to know this.
[31:19] Can I ask you something?
[31:25] Sure.
[31:27] Does your family not like me?
[31:33] Is this relationship against their wishes?
[31:39] It's not like this?
[31:42] Actually...
[31:45] Ever since sister Maheen has been divorced..
[31:49] I don't know what's happened to her.
[31:52] She overreacts on everything.
[31:53] You still haven't answered my questions?
[31:56] Answer what I asked you.
[32:03] I don't want you to ask me this.
[32:06] Why?
[32:09] Because I don't want to lie to you...
[32:13] or break your heart.
[32:20] Alright.
[32:24] It's alright.
[32:29] Zara...
[32:32] All of this doesn't matter.
[32:37] The truth is how happy we are with each other.
[32:43] We are so close to each other and understand each other.
[32:48] When a bond between a man and woman is strong... 
[32:52] whether someone is with you or against you...
[32:55] it doesn't matter.
[32:59] Then promise me something...
[33:04] What promise?
[33:06] That you won't let a third person come between us.
[33:10] We will not fight with each other because of someone else.
[33:16] Maheen's example is in front of us.
[33:20] Maheen has personal fight with her husband. 
[33:24] They always fight with each other because of someone else.
[33:42] I promise you...
[33:47] you will never have any complaints against me.
[33:51] I always stand with you.
[33:54] And I never let anyone come between us.
[34:00] I promise.
[34:12] And yes...
[34:15] I apologize to you on sister Maheen's behalf.
[34:19] You are drifting away from your promise.
[34:22] If we wont fight with each other because of someone else, 
[34:26] then we won't be embarrassed in front of each other because of someone else either.
[34:29] We won't apologize to each other as well.
[34:40] Thank you so much.
[34:42] You're welcome.
[34:44] Now let go of my hand.
[35:32] You're still awake?
[35:36] I'm about to go to sleep. You go ahead and sleep.
[35:49] Does you family not like me?
[35:52] Is this relationship against their will?
[35:57] I don't want you to ask me this.
[36:01] Because I don't want to lie to you...
[36:04] or break your heart.
[36:52] Go to sleep Zara... don't worry now.
[37:06] I was about to go to sleep. Why are you still up?
[37:20] I was awake to ask you why you haven't slept yet.
[37:24] I expected that you won't be able to sleep today.
[37:29] Goodnight.
