[00:12] This is no way... whenever they want they can come & whenever they want they can refuse
[00:17] is this some joke? Give me the phone let me see
[00:19] Fareeda!
[00:22] They are such liars and deceivers!
[00:25] I didn't expect them to be like this.
She is marrying her daughter for a second time, that too by lying. 
[00:30] What did Saad wanted to talk about that he couldn't say in front of us?
[00:34] What do I know?
[00:36] But I want to find out what it is.
[00:38] Adnan... why do you have a habit of interfering in other people's business? 
[01:13] aunt
[01:18] aunt, your breakfast
[01:21] you haven't eaten anything since last night
[01:24] I don't want to eat anything prepared by you
[01:27] take it away from here!
[01:29] why are you upset with me? What have I done, aunt?
[01:35] what have you done?
Don't you know?
[01:38] I had forbidden you, not to tell her divorce matter to anyone
[01:44] how did this matter got exposed?
[01:46] aunt, I don't know. I know nothing about it
[01:50] you are lying!
[01:53] I thought, I was wrong
[01:55] I did a mistake in understanding you
[01:58] but no
[02:00] you are exactly like your mother
[02:05] aunt, why are you bringing my mother in between?
[02:08] why I shouldn't bring her in between? Why?
[02:13] the way you've made my daughter's life a spectacle in front of all, the same way I will talk about your mother!
[02:21] its her brought-up that you've done such a vile act
[02:26] you are exactly like your mother
[02:30] both of you have done a conspiracy against my daughter, right?
[02:33] aunt, what are you saying. Why will I do this?
[02:36] because you are jealous of my daughter's happiness
[02:42] I have understood this on the very first day when you enter this house after marriage
[02:47] first you ate away my son & now you are after my daughter's happiness
[02:55] I had trusted you a lot
[02:58] but you have disappointed me once again, you've proved me wrong once again
[03:04] aunt, this is not true
[03:06] its not true?
its not?
[03:09] you knew it that we've hid the divorce matter from them, then how come this matter got out?
[03:16] you have told them, right?
You had called them?
[03:19] answer me
aunt, what are you doing?
[03:21] why did you tell them?
aunt!
[03:23] Fareeda, what are you doing?
why did you tell them?
[03:26] leave her
[03:28] ask her, why she did this?
[03:31] why did she ruined my daughter's life?
[03:44] you always find me & my daughter at mistake
[03:50] why don't you ask her, when she knew it that we've hid the divorce matter from them then why did she tell them?
[03:56] how did this matter got out?
[03:57] uncle, I swear I haven't said anything to anyone. I haven't told anything to anyone
[04:04] Zara... tell me, were you aware of the fact that these people are deceiving them?
[04:14] speak up dear, I am asking you something
[04:23] I wasn't expecting this from you, dear
[04:27] you had kept me in delusion as well
[04:29] uncle, I was just...
[04:35] got it
[04:38] I've understood
[04:40] Fareeda, stop shifting your blame on someone else's shoulders
[04:48] whatever had happened, is because of your greedy nature
[05:02] are you happy now?
get lost from here!
[05:07] don't come in front of me
[05:21] Zaini
[05:23] dad you?
yes
[05:25] what are you doing?
[05:27] nothing, I was just making notes
[05:30] are you angry with Saad?
[05:33] Saad told me
[05:37] I do understand that you must have mind his words
[05:42] but Saad has his own perspective towards life
[05:47] as far as I know him
[05:50] he isn't that kind of guy who does something hastily & in a wrong manner
[05:55] he wants to marry you but on the right time
[06:02] as far as my experience is concerned, I think
[06:06] the boy who is so serious about his future
[06:10] he can never do injustice with anyone
[06:17] whatever decision Saad must have done, I'm sure it must be best for both of you
[06:24] are you getting my point?
[06:26] yes, yes dad
[06:28] and I'm quite sure that Saad will keep you very happy
[06:32] just support him the way your mother had supported me
[06:37] yes dad, I will try my level best
[06:41] I was expecting the same sensibility from your side
[06:46] all my son-in-laws are very nice
[06:49] Usama is very nice
[06:54] Adeel was very nice
[06:57] Saad is very nice as well
[07:04] just keep smiling like this, dear
[07:08] do you know what happens, when children smiles?
[07:14] it energizes the old bones of the parents
[07:20] come on, now end your anger. He is here to meet you
[07:24] make a nice cup of tea for him and yourself & bring it
[07:28] ok, would you like to drink tea?
[07:33] stay happy
[07:35] thank you dad
[07:37] go..
yes
[07:57] so you've agreed?
[07:59] yes
[08:00] dad said, that's why I have agreed
[08:03] and when I was saying, you didn't believed me
[08:07] you didn't made me believe it
[08:09] you were just telling me off
[08:11] and the way you were telling me off, do you have any idea how hurt I was?
[08:16] you had switched off your phone too
[08:18] yes, its because I forgot to take my charger with me
[08:21] so you could have used someone else's. Say it clearly that you don't want to talk to me
[08:27] if you want to fight, then its ok
[08:31] I am leaving
[08:41] I won't let you go this way
[08:44] somebody will see, at least leave my hand Saad
[08:49] let them see
[08:50] Saad!
[08:54] all my ways go to you, Zaini
[08:57] you are my destination
[09:03] your smile brings light to my life
[09:12] never lessen your love for me
[11:49] uncle, please forgive me as I have hidden such a big matter from you
[11:56] dear, what complain shall I make to you?
[11:59] my own child is at mistake
[12:05] a child is just like a beating heart to their parents
[12:12] if that heart beat fluctuates a little then the entire soul gets affected
[12:23] I wish that a child could feel the pain of its parents then
[12:31] the parents would have never experienced any pain
[12:35] and if ever the children makes any mistake, then its a parents duty to rectify them or show them the right path
[12:46] but the parents who hide their children mistakes
[12:53] they face humiliation like this
[12:57] dear, I want you to go back to your parents house
[13:05] dear, its not like that I am upset with you or you've done any mistake
[13:13] but because they need you over there
[13:16] Sarwat had called me
[13:21] and I don't want that you shall not attend your brother's joyous occasion by getting busy in this house related matters
[13:31] uncle, I won't go anywhere from here
[13:34] I had promised Adeel that I will not leave this house or the family of this house
[13:40] it seems that I have done some good deed in my life
[13:48] that's why God has blessed us with a daughter-in-law like you
[13:54] stay blessed dear, stay blessed
[14:33] Mahi..4
[14:36] are you still crying?
Stop crying, dear
[14:41] get up, wash your face & come out with me
[14:45] everything is finished mom. Everything!
[14:51] I had told you not to do this
[14:55] let me tell them the truth
[14:58] nobody would have got to know anything
[15:00] its all done by your Zara. Only Zara!
[15:07] I think, I made a mistake. I couldn't recognize her
[15:12] I kept telling you mom, that she can never be on our side but you never listened to me at all
[15:23] Ok be quiet now
[15:25] be quiet now, don't bother yourself Mahi. You are my brave daughter
[15:31] don't cry, good girl
[15:33] how shall I stop crying?
[15:35] my life is ruined, everything is destroyed. What will happen now?
[15:44] don't cry, please. Wash your face & come with me. get up, come out of your room
[15:52] I don't want to go
[16:06] Shaista
[16:09] I am not understanding the reason behind Saad's refusal
[16:14] when did he refuse?
[16:16] he had asked for sometime to think, that's it
[16:19] its the same thing, whether you hold the ear from this side or that side
[16:22] I think there is some storm behind this haste
[16:27] there is something for sure, I doubt
[16:31] what doubt you have?
[16:33] Saad is a sensible & literate boy & Zaini is our daughter
[16:39] I am not talking about Zaini, I am saying something else. And you've brought Zaini in between
[16:45] your mind is always the factory of doubts & conspiracy
[16:50] why Saad will do any such thing?
[16:52] you think whatever I am saying is wrong, right?
but a time will come when you'll find all of my words true
[16:59] whose phone is it?
[17:02] its of my friend "Jameel"
[17:06] what is this time to call?
[17:08] what's wrong with you? Its my friend's call
[17:11] you've become James Bond by watching mysterious dramas
[17:15] have a look, its written Jameel. Check the spelling
[17:19] look what you say!
[17:21] I'm going to take the call, meanwhile warm the dinner
[17:24] hello!
yes?
[17:27] yes yes
[17:36] how are you, Jameela?
[17:39] I am fine, but you don't sound fine
[17:43] what happened? Have you fought again?
[17:46] its a regular routine. What is the duty of a wife? To suck their husband's blood, that's it
[17:52] don't say this
[17:54] since you'll get married to me in the future, so will you say the same thing for me as well?
[17:58] No no, why will I say you?
You are my life my world.. 
[18:03] why will I say this to you?
[18:16] I see, so these love birds are sitting here
[18:21] with whom you are talking? Who is it?
[18:23] no, I am not saying to you. I was just watching TV
[18:35] disgusting man!
[18:37] to whom you are saying this?
[18:39] to whom I can say?
[18:49] well... 
[18:50] are you talking about Adnan uncle?
[18:54] why? What happened?
[18:56] what had to happen?
[18:58] few days ago I saw him with a girl
[19:03] what? with a girl?
[19:06] just now he is talking on the phone, I think he is talking to her
[19:09] but how come Adnan uncle do this?
[19:13] what do you mean by this? 
It doesn't take time for a man to change
[19:18] and after marriage, such men gets involved in an affair with some other girls
[19:22] if Shaista aunt gets to know about it, she won't spare him
[19:26] what can she do? It doesn't make any difference to him. That's why he does such things
[19:29] but please, don't open your mouth. There is no need to discuss this matter with anyone
[19:34] I shall keep my mouth shut?
[19:36] you shall keep your mouth shut! Because you keep telling everyone
[19:39] what! I am forbidding you myself then why will I tell anyone? I don't want to get into any trouble
[19:45] I think, I made a mistake by telling you
[19:53] yes greetings! How are you dear? Why were you not picking up the phone?
[19:57] what difference does it make, however I am here. Whether I shall live or die?
[20:02] what's wrong Maheen, what are you saying?
[20:05] did you went to Mahi's wedding? How's the guy, how was the wedding?
[20:09] No, the wedding couldn't happen
[20:12] why?
[20:13] the guy's family didn't come
[20:15] very nice...
[20:18] what's wrong Maheen, are you in your senses? What are you saying?
[20:21] what else I should say, mom? The way Mahi treats me, it was evident to happen with her
[20:26] they are old matters Maheen, forget them
[20:28] I cannot forget, mom. Today, if my life is in a problem then its just because of Mahi
[20:34] what problems do you have in your life, tell me
[20:37] you are sitting in your house, you are happy then why are you being ungrateful?
[20:40] You will say this. What do you know that how they treat me here
[20:45] dear look, fights & quarrels do happen in every family
[20:49] you have to be a bit sensible & patience
[20:53] mom, if you have to talk about such things then don't call me
[20:58] okay, fine.. let me leave you on your own. I won't say anything
[21:04] I have called to inform you that your brother is getting married next week
[21:10] your father has delayed it for a week's time because of Mahi
[21:15] we wanted to get Zaini & Saad married as well along with them. But Saad wants to get settled first
[21:22] why? Why can't we do their wedding together?
[21:25] dear, its Saad's decision . Also your father is agreed on it
[21:30] why does dad listen to everyone?
[21:32] yes, and he listens to you too
[21:34] I don't understand dad's hasty decisions
[21:38] after all, what as such is the calamity mom?
[21:41] and if Saad doesn't want to marry right now then refuse Ali as well. Later we will do their weddings together
[21:47] Okay, leave it. Nobody has asked for your suggestion
[21:51] and all of us are very happy
[21:53] specially I am very happy that my son's heartiest desire is about to be fulfilled
[21:58] he will get some sense once he'll get married to Dolly, you'll see
[22:02] don't talk non-sense, Mahi
[22:06] you are the eldest daughter of our family, so come to our house to help us. That's what I am telling you
[22:12] I won't come on the wedding, nor I will come to that house
[22:17] are you in your senses?
[22:19] what are you saying?
[22:20] when you don't care about me at all, nor you listen to me then why shall I come?
[22:26] Maheen?
[22:29] hello?
[22:44] I feel disgusted from you, I hate you!
[22:46] I hate your existence. Get out of here!
[22:49] Mahi!
Ouch... aunty...
[23:01] did Maheen said this to you?
[23:04] which other child do we have who doesn't have any manners to talk to her parents?
[23:12] what else she was saying?
[23:13] she keeps repeating all those old matters
[23:19] we'll visit her in-laws house to talk to her. She will be convinced if we'll appease her
[23:24] do you think this way?
I don't think so
[23:28] she is so stubborn, she won't agree
[23:32] talk to her
[23:35] you've made up your mind already
[23:38] but we haven't talked to her as of yet
[23:39] well, lets see
[23:42] Ok Ali is coming tomorrow, have you done all the arrangements?
[23:45] I am doing that, I've asked Saad to handle everything
[23:52] handover a few work to Usama as well, as he is your elder son-in-law
[24:00] yes
[24:03] let me see
[24:05] drink your tea, its getting cold
[24:08] I think its better to serve lunch, as I don't feel like drinking tea right now
[24:11] Okay fine, let me get it served
[24:14] wait a few minutes
[24:24] the guy's family didn't come
[24:26] Very nice...
[24:28] what's wrong Maheen, are you in your senses? What are you saying?
[24:32] what else I should say, mom? The way Mahi treats me, it was evident to happen with her
[24:39] they are old matters Maheen, forget them
[24:41] I cannot forget, mom. Today, if my life is in a problem then its just because of Mahi
[25:10] mom!
what happened?
[25:11] see, its Maheen
[25:13] oh! what I am seeing?
[25:16] such a shamelessness!
[25:18] she is such a dark-horse
[25:21] look carefully whether its Maheen
yes yes, she is Maheen
[25:25] God! her mother doesn't even know that what her daughter is doing. How much freedom they've given tho their girl
[25:32] in what things you are getting into, what happened?
[25:34] mom, I'm saying lets go & show this to aunt
[25:36] No, I am not going there. There is no need of it
[25:39] what do you mean its not needed? Its important to go there
[25:43] if someone else would have seen Maheen instead of us, then our family had been so much insulted.
[25:47] have you ever thought about it?
[25:49] yes, that's right but..
[25:51] no mom, no ifs or buts. We have to go & tell aunt everything
[25:55] why aren't you getting it, mom? Aunt's insult means the insult of our entire family
[25:59] I've clicked a few pictures as well, lets go & show her
[26:03] really?
[26:04] lets go, take her along too. Come
let her be, come on
[26:20] what is this?
[26:32] tell me
[26:54] did I sent you to the university to do such things?
[27:01] yes?
[27:02] brother, ask her who is this guy?
[27:07] honestly speaking, I was so shocked to see this. I felt so ashamed
[27:15] I couldn't move from my place
[27:17] then Mahi said, lets go & tell this to uncle & aunt
[27:22] what if someone else sees this, eventually it will become the basis of defamation for us
[27:30] aunt, why are you exaggerating the matter for no reason?
[27:36] what!
[27:38] hey, look at her. How she is arguing, Mahi!
[27:44] this is great!
"On top of theft, showing off your chest"
[27:50] Maheen, tell me how come you've become so shameless?
[27:57] you should have cared about your father's honor
[28:00] you've auctioned our honor in the middle of the market. Not only your father's honor but you've stained the entire family's honor
[28:08] girls like you are the reason of defamation
[28:13] brother, by the way its your fault as well
[28:18] you should have kept your children under control.
[28:22] After all, its the duty of parents to put chains in their children feet
[28:30] if my Mahi would have done any such antic
[28:34] then I would have thrashed her so hard that the entire world would have seen
[28:44] dad, its not like that
[28:47] they are putting false allegation on me
[28:49] keep your mouth shut! Not a single word
[28:55] mom, Talha & I was just...
enough Maheen!
[29:01] enough is enough!
[29:04] whatever we had to listen we have, not anymore
[29:09] Sarwat
[29:12] call Usama's family & say "yes" for her proposal
[29:18] I want to wed her off with Usama as soon as possible
[29:37] dad... but dad
[32:14] you guys have visited us after such a long time
[32:20] we had thought about it many times, but don't know why we couldn't come
[32:23] Okay, let me call Maheen right away
[32:26] Maheen... Maheen. Dear, look who is here
[32:32] greetings mom & dad
[32:35] Greetings!
[32:38] how are you?
[32:40] Where is Usama?
[32:43] actually today he'll come late from office, just now he had called to inform
[32:46] okay
[32:49] actually sister Ruqqaiya, we have come to give you an invitation
[32:54] next week is my son Ali's wedding
[32:56] really?
[32:59] but nobody told us anything
[33:04] Maheen, does Usama knows this?
[33:07] yes, I had called Usama for this work. He knows it
[33:14] although we live in the same house, but it seems as if we have distances of miles among us
[33:21] and we've always honored your words. We have always come, whenever you have invited us
[33:27] we attended Zara's wedding too
[33:30] however, do you know. How badly Maheen had misbehaved with us
[33:37] if anyone else would have been in our place then he would have never attended that wedding
[33:41] sister Ruqqaiya, even earlier I had said sorry to you on this matter
[33:50] if you want, I can apologize to you once again
[33:53] no brother Manzoor, its not like that. Don't say this, I've said it just like that
[33:58] we do realize that whatever happened shouldn't have happened. That's why we came to you to remove the distances
[34:07] its just that you will attend our joyous occasion, so... We are here with so much of hope
[34:13] and Maheen, dear you also leave your anger now & attend your brother's joyous occasion
[34:18] what are you saying?
[34:20] isn't Maheen attending the wedding?
[34:23] are you guys here to appease her?
[34:25] actually everything happened all of a sudden that
[34:29] okay
[34:31] anyways, no problem. 
better late than never
[34:35] don't you worry at all. The way I have remove all the grudges from my heart, the same way you also remove all the things from your heart
[34:42] I will personally bring Maheen to your house, you guys shall not worry & go home
[34:46] thank you so much, sister Ruqqaiya
[34:48] please sit & talk. Meanwhile, let me ask Sawera to bring tea for you people
[34:59] dear Maheen
[35:01] end your anger
[35:03] now I've come personally to appease you
[35:06] how are you dear?
[35:09] I'm fine
[35:11] until when you'll stay upset?
[35:17] well...
