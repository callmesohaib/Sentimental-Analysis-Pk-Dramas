[00:16] oh my dear, I knew it
[00:19] mom you! 
[00:20] why are you sleeping on the sofa?
[00:23] mom, just like that.
[00:36] sister, whatever you are doing is not right 
[00:39] what am I doing? 
[00:40] sister, that guy is not right for you. Stay away from him
[00:43] as if you know a lot about guys! Have you done PhD in it?
[00:53] Sorry, I had asked for a car from my friend. But it couldn't be arranged
[00:57] else, I wouldn't have brought you on the bike in such a hot weather
[00:59] Its ok Saad, at least our work is done
[01:02] Indeed! Shall we sit somewhere & have lunch?
[01:05] No, lets go home as Dolly is also there
[01:08] I had already prepared the lunch before coming here, so we'll have lunch with her
[01:10] but at lease we can have an ice-cream. Right?
Please don't say no
[01:14] Okay
[01:16] hey Saad! you are here
[01:21] Ejaz you!
[01:22] how are you?
[01:23] I am fine..
[01:26] I came for some office work, but you didn't come to office today
[01:29] No, actually I had some work here
[01:32] Okay
[01:36] and who is she?
[01:37] She is my wife Zara
[01:41] seriously?
[01:42] Greetings!
[01:43] Greetings! How are you, sister?
[01:46] shall we meet tomorrow at the office?
[01:47] okay
[03:21] Manzoor
[03:22] yes
[03:23] you are sitting here! And Maheen is asking about you since so long
[03:29] actually I am waiting for Zaini, as its her time to come back home
[03:36] when did she come?
[03:38] She came early morning, as soon as you left for work
[03:45] Ok
[03:49] what's the matter, why do you look worried to me?
[03:54] Its just that I am feeling a bit anxious
[03:58] for what you are worried?
[04:00] did something happened outside?
[04:03] I saw Zara
[04:09] you saw Zara?
[04:12] where?
[04:14] with Saad
[04:18] both seem quite happy
[04:24] Sarwat, doesn't she miss us?
[04:31] can a child forget her parents?
[04:37] whether they miss us or not, but at least they shall stay happy together. That's it
[04:43] children can forget their parents..
[04:47] but parents can never forget their children
[04:58] I did her brought up in these hands, she grew up here. And she..
[05:05] why are you worrying yourself?
[05:08] if she would have realized her mistake a bit, then she would have come to apologize to us
[05:13] parents are always ready to forgive the biggest mistake of their children
[05:18] but she didn't come
[05:21] neither she came nor she had apologized
[05:24] it means that..
[05:29] She & Saad were already involved with each other
[05:34] So, when she doesn't care about you or us. Then why are you worried about her?
[05:45] yes
[06:48] I am missing you so much, dad
[06:50] please forgive me
[06:53] meet me once, dad
[06:56] I want to cry while hugging you
[06:59] I want to tell you the truth
[07:01] please talk to me, dad
[07:49] Sir, may I come in?
[07:52] yes
[07:57] Sir, I was asked to check this. Please have a look at it once
[08:03] Miss...
[08:05] Zaini
[08:06] Miss Zaini, its 6 PM and you are still in the office?
[08:10] actually sir Rashid told me that you want this file urgently that's why
[08:14] our office timings are 9am to 5pm
[08:17] and our company doesn't allow late sitting to the female staff
[08:20] so please be careful next time
[08:22] yes sir, I will be careful next time
[08:25] Okay, you may go I will check it
[08:27] thank you, sir
[08:54] why do you come in front of me again & again, Zaini?
[08:58] I want to forget you
[09:01] I want to remove you from my mind & heart
[09:05] your mistrust has made me so weak & helpless, Zaini
[09:09] that I am afraid of trusting someone else
[09:14] I fear, what if she also leaves me the way you had left me
[09:27] Saad
[09:32] are you still awake?
[09:35] yes, I was doing some work
[09:39] you haven't slept as of yet?
[09:41] I am not feeling sleepy
[09:44] did someone said something?
[09:49] then?
[09:56] Saad, do you know
[09:59] today was the date when Adeel had expressed his feelings to me for the very first time
[10:05] and you came to me while crying
[10:09] do you remember that?
yes
[10:12] I was afraid
[10:14] I couldn't understand how to tell Adeel
[10:18] that I also like him
[10:22] and then you had helped me
[10:25] I do remember
[10:27] also you had helped me too
[10:30] do you remember, how Zaini used to mind
[10:33] whenever I..
[10:45] he used to love you so much
[10:49] sometimes I used to feel so jealous by seeing you both
[10:54] that how can anyone love someone so much
[10:58] and when you got married
[11:02] the way Adeel had supported you, I used to feel proud of you both
[11:08] both of you had such a strong relation
[11:12] how hard Mahi & aunt Fareeda had tried
[11:16] but they couldn't harm your relation
[11:20] this is the power of love, Zara
[11:26] no matter how strong or dangerous a storm is
[11:30] if one is holding the hand of its partner strongly
[11:34] then we don't leave the hand by getting worried
[11:37] Saad, if I had an idea
[11:41] that mine & Adeel's companionship is of a few days
[11:48] then I would have never let him stay away from me
[11:53] Zara, life & death is not in our control
[12:01] today I saw dad after so many days
[12:07] but he didn't talk to me
[12:11] Saad, am I so bad that my father doesn't want to meet me or talk to me?
[12:18] nobody had talked to me even at my brother's wedding
[12:24] and mom
[12:28] mom didn't even looked at me
[12:36] everything will be fine
[12:39] when everyone will get to know the truth
[12:42] then everything will be like previous times, Zara
[12:46] what if it couldn't be fine, then?
[12:51] won't I ever be able to go to my house?
[13:24] take this
[13:26] give this to your mom's step brother
[13:29] get this house transferred on your name, and after that..
[13:33] you & I will live together in this house
[13:39] what is this?
[13:44] a lot of jewelry!
[13:47] did you rob someone?
[13:51] I haven't done robbery, its my wife's jewelry
[13:56] wife's?
[13:59] did you gave her all this?
[14:01] how can I!
[14:03] She got them made secretly from me, and a few of them are of her granny's. What do you call them family jewelry
[14:09] She had kept them safely in the locker, so I took them out & kept them safely with me
[14:13] and as soon as I got the chance
[14:15] I took them out & brought for you

[21:51] I have an acquaintance
[21:53] his wife is a marriage broker, she sent these pictures
[21:58] why have you brought them?
[22:00] I have told you many times to fix Mahi's marriage somewhere
[22:04] but you don't care about it at all
[22:08] so obviously I have to do something
[22:11] I want to get relieved of my responsibilities
[22:15] and if I am doing something, then you are having an objection on it
[22:19] Enough! I've seen enough of your efforts
[22:24] I don't want to ruin my daughter's life upon your orders, its decided
[22:31] Mahi has ruined her life with her own hands
[22:35] whatever it is, anyways..
[22:37] I will never fix her marriage now upon your orders
[22:42] do you have any guy in mind?
[22:44] No
[22:47] then don't argue!
[22:50] show these pictures to her

[26:13] so with whom you want to get married?
You never like anyone
[26:18] I will like someone, just wait
[26:22] what's wrong with you Mahi?
[26:26] I think, your brain got affected very badly since your marriage was called off
[26:33] you won't understand
[26:36] and don't ever talk to me about my past relation
[26:40] he wasn't suitable for me
[26:43] what!

[26:48] listen... so much of arrogance isn't good though
[26:54] you don't understand me, mom
[26:56] I will find such a guy that the entire world will be envious
[27:01] Fine, I pray it happens this way
[27:05] May your dream come true this time
