[01:17] I did wrong. I shouldn't have raised my hand. What did I do?
[01:27] I've given her a chance to act as the victim.
[01:32] How could I make such a big mistake? I should have controlled.
[01:37] Mom is right. What should I do now?
[01:45] Hamza is also here.
[02:33] Mirha?
Yes?
[02:36] Are you busy?
No. Tell me.
[02:40] Actually, Mahi is worried for you. She wants to meet Aquib.
[02:50] What will you do about it?
[02:52] What do you want? Should I make her meet Aquib and get him insulted more?
[02:57] And, you know Mahi. She'll speak whatever she wants to.
[03:02] She hasn't even met him and termed him a robber. What will she do when she meets him?
[03:07] And, I'll handle my problem myself. You should leave it.
[03:10] Mirha, its just not your problem.
[03:14] Whatever you're doing isn't right.
[03:18] What did I do wrong? Is it wrong to like someone?
[03:23] And you please don't say this.
[03:26] I don't say that its wrong or bad to like someone.
[03:32] Its your right to like someone but..
But what?
[03:39] I know everything Mirha. The day Mahi came in my room, I heard everything.
[03:45] You tell me, is it right to meet someone secretly? Or lying to everyone..
[03:50] He came himself. I didn't call him.
[03:52] Why did he come so late at night? Does he not respect you? Doesn't he care?
[03:56] What do you mean?
[03:57] Listen to me, its not Aquib but Mahi who insulted me. She accused me.
[04:04] And why are you supporting her? Was I running away with him?
[04:08] Mirha, what are you saying?
[04:11] Can you hear yourself? Its not something small.
[04:15] You can tell mom, dad.. whoever you want to tell.
[04:20] You can defame me
[04:22] Why would I defame you? Do you think I would do that?
[04:26] If I had to tell uncle and aunt, would I talk to you sitting here?
[04:32] I'm just trying to make you understand Mirha.
[04:35] All of us are worried for you. We want to know who is that boy?
[04:39] If you're serious, make us meet him. We want to know what sort of a boy is he.
[04:44] I'll never let Mahi meet him.
[04:56] Should I make you meet him?
[05:07] That's it? You would have no answer to it.
[05:10] When you're telling me you should all meet him, do it then. Whats wrong with you now?
[05:24] Mirha?
[05:40] Zaviyar?
[05:42] What am I hearing? You've said yes to the proposal?
[05:46] Yes aunt. I wanted to surprise you that's why I didn't tell you.
[05:50] I went away for two days and you took such a big decision.
[05:54] You didn't even think it was important to ask me.
[05:56] Aunt, please sit. I'll explain you.
[05:59] I don't want to talk to you. You've disappointed me.
[06:03] Aunt, I cannot even think about hurting you. But...
[06:08] But what?
[06:09] I liked Maheen.
[06:11] Whats wrong Zaviyar? You'll get a hundred of other girls.
[06:16] How will you adjust with that homely girl? And do you know?
[06:20] Those people don't have any standards.
[06:22] Aunt, I don't want any people obsessed with luxuries or materials in my life.
[06:26] I want to live a simple life, like uncle.
[06:31] What am I hearing? I'm surprised Zaviyar.
[06:34] Do you even know what your saying? I've thought so much for you...
[06:39] Aunty..
[06:40] I care for your emotions but I liked her
[06:46] Can you not accept it for the sake of my happiness?
[06:50] See if you don't agree, I'll not get married.
[06:54] But what if you get me married and I'm not happy with her either.
[06:59] God forbid. What are you saying? All of us want to see you happy Zaviyar.
[07:03] Then please agree.
[07:07] You like Mahi so much?
[07:14] Alright. Its up to you. I have no objections.
[07:19] Thank you, aunt.
[07:26] Hello.
[07:29] Hello dear.
[07:32] Hello.
[07:47] I love my daughters very much.
[07:56] Every father does that.
[08:06] If I give my children the right to live their life so,
[08:15] I don't allow them to snatch this right from someone else.
[08:31] You're a good boy.
[08:36] What should I I tell you more?
[08:40] I'm looking at your trials.
[08:46] I'm embarrassed in front of you as well.
[08:55] Mr. Manzoor
[09:00] I told you, you don't have to sit amongst us when we talk.
[09:12] As a father, I'm forced to ask you,
[09:22] to please discuss with Maheen.
[09:28] Talk to her.
[09:33] Together, decide about your life.
[09:38] We'll accept whatever decisions you take.
[09:43] No complaints or so. I promise you that.
[10:04] I'm going with Osama.
[10:49] Be happy dear.
[10:52] bye!
[11:01] You..
[11:05] Have you thought it through before saying it?
[11:10] No. It isn't necessary to think before taking a step.
[11:15] Sometimes you have to step ahead earlier.
[11:22] I'm asking you.
Yes, lets go.
[11:28] Sure.
[11:34] May God take care of you, my child.
[12:04] I shouldn't have come like this. What did I do?
[12:15] That Dolly has turned everyone to her side telling them fake stories.
[12:27] What do I do without even thinking?!
[12:46] Mom water..
[12:52] Mom, Maheen is here.
[12:58] Hello mom..
[13:00] Hello.
[13:01] Hello.
Hello.
[13:03] How are you?
Absolutely fine. How are you?
[13:06] I'm fine as well.
[13:08] By the way, how long are you staying here for this time?
[13:11] Mom..
[13:13] What do you mean? Why are you amazed at my return?
[13:19] I'm not amazed. I'm awestruck seeing you here.
[13:23] I am thinking whether you came here yourself or whether Usama made you accept it.
[13:33] I came here myself, aunty.
[13:37] Its good. Better late than never.
[13:40] Elders say that a girl is respected truly in her husband's house.
[13:43] Otherwise a girl is just like a guest in her parents' house.
[13:47] Now since you're here, try to take this house and this family as your own.
[13:56] If your lectures are over, can I go to my room and rest for a while?
[14:03] Yes, Maheen. You go to your room. I'll bring your bags.
[14:13] She hasn't stopped answering back.
[14:15] I thought she'd be fine now.
[14:18] Why is she here, by the way?
[14:19] Mom, this is her house as well.
[14:21] You're right. This is a house. Not a guest house.
[14:24] She cannot come and go back to her house as she pleases.
[14:27] I thought, since she's back after ages, she'll have some sense knocked into her. But she's still the same.
[14:34] She should have come and apologized to mom.
[14:37] Apologize? For what?
[14:40] Oh come on. When my own son is at fault, why should I complain to others?
[14:45] Whats wrong with you people? Mom she just came back. How are you talking to her?
[14:51] If you keep talking to her like this, she won't be able to adjust.
[14:55] Girls learn to adjust in all kinds of situation and your wife isn't a newly wedded bride that you're supporting her like this.
[15:00] You've been married for 4 years.
[15:03] Listen to me. I'm not the type of mother who complains to her son about her daughter in law.
[15:08] You know Maheen and me very well.
[15:11] She is back with something in her mind. She's here for a reason.
[15:24] Look at her. She's back to create new dramas.
[15:28] Mom, drink water. Let it be. Whats wrong with you?
[15:31] Be quiet. You're always supporting her.
[16:29] You've always acted like her shield, ever since she was a child.
[16:34] So what are fathers for?
[16:38] But I didn't like it. To bow down in front of our son in law.
[16:43] This is your love, Sarwat. But you were looking at your husband.
[16:53] If you had seen a helpless father, you wouldn't have disliked it.
[17:01] Maheen is our daughter and its our responsibility to bring her life back on track.
[17:10] I don't want her to commit a mistake that'll make her regret.
[17:16] I'm thinking what would have happened if she hadn't gone back with Usama even today.
[17:22] Maybe it would have been her last meeting with Usama.
[17:25] What are you saying? Would you have kept your daughter at home for all her life?
[17:32] What else could we do?
[17:37] Where are you going?
[17:39] I'm going to offer prayer of gratitude, what else?
[17:43] Yes, thank God that Maheen went to her house herself.
[17:50] Why are you smiling?
[17:53] You're so scared of Maheen.
[17:55] As if you don't know how bold and stubborn she is.
[18:00] Oh I know my daughter. This is why I was surprised.
[18:04] But I'm happy as well.
[18:06] I'm just scared she'll be stubborn about something and come back home.
[18:11] Don't argue with her anymore.
[18:14] Why would I argue with her? God forgive me. I'd never do anything.
[18:19] Offer your prayers and call Maheen. Ask them if they've reached or not.
[18:24] ok
[18:26] I'll call Zara and give her the good news as well.
[18:30] Yes..
[18:32] I'll go now.
[19:07] Zara?
[19:24] What happened? Why are you so worried?
[19:30] Adeel...
[19:33] where have you gone Adeel? Where did you go leaving me all alone?
[19:41] I've not left you and gone anywhere.
[19:45] I'm always with you.
[19:52] The closest to you.
[19:58] Don't cry.
[20:01] If you'll cry, then I'll be in pain.
[20:12] I have a surprise for you.
[20:15] Close your eyes.
[20:19] Close your eyes.
[22:04] Zaini, we're both travelers of the same boat.
[22:09] If one of us drowns, she'll take the other one along.
[22:14] I mean.. If there will be a problem between you and Saad, it'll affect Ali and my relationship as well.
[23:33] The number you're trying to call is busy at the moment. Please try again later.
[24:40] Your phone?
Are you done talking?
[24:42] Yes thank you. Actually my credit ended so I used your phone.
[24:46] Its no problem.
[24:47] She said her husband will come tomorrow to get clothes.
[24:51] You know he's an old acquaintance.
[24:54] Mom has always asked him to get our clothes stitched.
[24:56] I don't need any new clothes. Please ask aunt to tell him not to come.
[25:03] What happened? Why don't you need any new clothes?
[25:05] As it is, your old clothes are very bright. You cannot wear them.
[25:15] Did you mind?
[25:19] I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that.
[25:24] Are you upset?
No. I'm not upset at all.
[25:29] Then why aren't you talking?
[25:32] Yes, I forgot to tell you. You had a call when I was talking to someone. You should check.
[25:44] Whose call was it?
[25:46] Mom's message. Maheen has gone back to her house.
[25:51] Oh God. Mahi you're here. I was looking for you everywhere.
[25:55] Maheen has gone back to her in laws, mom.
[25:57] What? How did this happen?
[26:00] I mean, did her mother in law come to take her back?
[26:05] I don't know. I'll call mom tomorrow and ask her.
[26:10] Alright. Its a good thing. Daughters look good settled in their houses.
[26:19] What happened to her? Oh alright. I brought this for you.
[26:25] Eat this. You have to finish this.
[27:09] Maheen, aunty is calling.
I know.
[27:22] You're still upset?
[27:24] It won't do anything good to make it up to me. And rather than sitting here and making up with me,
[27:29] you go and make it up to your mom.
[27:31] She'll already shooting me down with her taunts.
[27:36] I'm trying.
[27:38] I won't say anything. When nobody values me in this house, why should I even talk.
[27:44] Maheen, whatever mom said, she said to me.
[27:48] And why would someone say anything to you.
[27:50] I am not mistaken. I'm not a child. I understand everything.
[27:55] And even you should also understand.
[27:57] I will not tolerate anybody wronging me. I'm back here but don't take it as my weakness.
[28:06] If you had to do all this, why did you come back?
[28:43] Dolly?
[28:46] Why are you sitting here all alone?
[28:51] Actually, its our last night here. So I thought I'd see my fill.
[28:59] What do you mean?
[29:01] Nothing.
[29:04] This means, you're going to go directly to Islamabad with me from the marriage hall?
[29:13] Why are you looking at me like this?
[29:15] I'm asking for our honeymoon. Would you go?
[29:22] Ali..
[29:27] What if we don't get married?
[29:34] What? Dolly, why are you thinking like this?
[29:40] See.. I cannot live without you.
[29:44] Why?
[29:49] Listening to Maheen, I thought I could live without you.
[29:58] But I was wrong.
[30:02] I cannot live without you. I..
[30:07] I'm afraid to lose you.
[30:12] Dolly, nobody can drive us apart. We love each other.
[30:23] Respect is the foundation for love.
[30:26] Without respect, there's no value for love too.
[30:32] Whatever Maheen did, I didn't tell anyone.
[30:37] For your respect and for my mom's.
[30:42] But Ali..
[30:44] Don't I deserve someone talking for my right too?
[30:51] Nobody asked her anything.
[30:55] Nobody asked why did she change her decision and left all of a sudden.
[31:03] See, Dolly give me some time. I'll fix everything.
[31:10] If this storm doesn't settle down, then?
[31:14] What if it drowns everything? What will you do?
[31:18] Don't think like that. Trust me, I'll fix everything.
[31:25] Leave everything and tell me why are you sitting here all alone, so late at night.
[31:31] Its just that..
[31:34] We'll go back tomorrow, I just wanted to sit alone for a while.
[31:40] Did someone say something to you?
[31:44] Then?
[31:47] Mom says that its not a good thing for a girl to visit her in laws so openly before she gets married.
[31:53] She's right as well.
[31:55] Then, we'll make this house, your permanent house from tomorrow onwards.
[32:04] Come on. Finish your tea.
[32:08] I'll see what you were reading.
[34:02] What are you doing?
[34:04] yes?
What are you doing?
[34:06] I'm looking for recipes.
[34:09] I'll cook something good for Zara. See, I made breakfast for her as well. Is it good?
[34:13] Have you lost your mind?
[34:16] What sort of language are you using with me? I'm your mother.
[34:20] I'm right.
[34:21] Haven't you started pampering Zara too much?
[34:24] Why shouldn't I? She's my Adeel's wife.
[34:28] She is the mother of his child.
[34:30] She's not his wife. She was. Perhaps you've forgotten that your son isn't alive.
[34:35] And that's only because of your daughter in law.
[34:38] Why are you so bitter Mahi? Why do you talk like this?
[34:42] Stop with your dramas.
[34:44] I'm not doing any dramas. My mother in law pampered me when I was expecting.
[34:49] Zara is expecting now and I'm pampering her. Whats the drama in that?
[34:53] Have you forgotten what Zara or her mother did to you?
[34:57] Yes, I've forgotten everything. You also forget everything, for God's sake.
[35:03] I will not forget anything, mom.
[35:05] And remember one thing. Zara is in this house until I want her to be.
[35:10] Don't be nonsense.
[35:11] Zara is the daughter of this house and she'll not go anywhere.
[35:15] So you'll taunt me because of her?
[35:18] For God's sake. Forgive me.
[35:21] Say whatever you want to say, to your father. I don't have time for all this.
[35:27] She's made me crazy early in the morning.
[35:41] What? What did you say? She left? Without anything? How could you let her go?
[35:48] Look at her, she's gone completely crazy.
[35:50] She hit you.
[35:53] Its good that you answered her back.
[35:56] It doesn't look like you're the daughter in law to be of this house.
[36:00] You're so humble and kind.
[36:06] How could she hit you? How dare she?
[36:12] Adnan uncle..
[36:14] I didn't want to mention this to you. Please keep it to yourself.
[36:20] Finish everything here. As it is, we're going back to our house.
[36:25] Why do you worry? Don't worry. I'll not tell anyone anything. You know how I am.
[36:37] See dear, your Adnan uncle is with you.
[36:40] Why do you worry? I'm here. Alright? I'll leave now.
[37:07] Shaista, listen to me, Shaista. Listen.
[37:13] I'm ashamed to even say this.
[37:18] You were with Dolly.. I'm ashamed to even think about it.
[37:24] You have lost your mind. Have you?
[37:27] Enough. No more lies.
[37:31] Tell me the truth, what were you doing with Dolly?
[37:35] Listen to me with a calm mind.
[37:38] No. I need an answer to my question. What relationship do you have with her?
[37:43] What nonsense is this? Have you lost your mind?
[37:45] Yes. I've lost my mind. I'm crazy.
[37:48] Listen to me. I didn't call her, she came herself.
[37:51] Sarwat send kebabs, she was here to give us that.
[37:55] You're lying. You're lying.
[37:59] I'm not lying. All kids of this house are like my own children. Whenever they're worried,
[38:05] I'm worried. I'm happy when they're happy. I laugh and enjoy with them.
[38:10] She was worried and I was just offering her sympathies.
[38:13] Don't lie to me.
[38:15] I saw everything with my own eyes. My own eyes.
[38:18] Sometimes what you see with your eyes is a lie too.
[38:22] Don't you believe your husband? Come down and ask yourself.
[38:26] Maheen was hitting Dolly so I just sympathized with her. She was crying.
[38:31] I don't need clarifications. Please leave.
[38:34] Or else I'll leave.
[38:36] You're taking me wrong. Me. I take all children here as my own.
[38:42] I treat them with love and kindness and you're doubting me.
[38:48] I look for my own kids in these kids
[38:51]  I tend to make up for what I don't have with them and you..
[38:56] You're accusing me of something so cheap. I'm ashamed of myself. You..
[39:31] I have to do something. 
[39:33] I will have to. 
[39:36] First she snatched my brother.
[39:38] Then dad.. and now she wants to snatch my mother. 
[39:43] What is it about this child that even mom has changed?
[39:50] I cannot tolerate this.
[40:07] Maheen will laugh on me. I cannot let this happen.
[40:14] I'll have to do something. 
[40:19] I'll have to throw you out of this house, Zara.
[40:22] I hate you people. I hate you.
