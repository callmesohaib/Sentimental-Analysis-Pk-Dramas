[00:12] we tried our level best, but we couldn't save him
[00:15] I'm sorry, he is no more 
[00:17] No... no
[00:18] No...
[00:20] whatever I did with you 
[00:24] nobody can thought of it
[00:29] my only brother...
[00:34]  I had killed my only brother's child
[00:38] she had pushed me deliberately 
[00:41] she had snatched Adeel's last memorable from me
[00:45] she had snatched my baby from me, only because of you!
[00:50] not only she did this 
[00:53] In order to oust me from that house, she had alleged me of being characterless
[00:58] so that I can get defamed & can never go back to that house 
[01:25] Saad
[01:27] my dear...
[01:30] get up, go to your room & sleep there. Why were you sleeping here?
[01:34] mom, I don't know when I had slept here at night
[01:39] when did you wake up?
[01:40] just a while ago
[01:45] what's the matter? Is something bothering my son?
[01:49] No mom
[01:52] You are so quiet since you came back from Zara's house
[01:57] what's the matter?
[01:59] tell me
[02:00] just like that, mom
[02:03] I was thinking something
[02:05] what?
[02:07] what's the matter, tell me
[02:12] mom, I was thinking about Zara
[02:18] she couldn't forget Adeel as of yet
[02:23] I know
[02:27] but if you will give her love
[02:30] then she will forget all of her griefs
[02:33] mom, love is not in my fate
[02:39] its better for me to happily get separated instead of forceful relations
[02:43] what are you saying, Saad?
[02:46] I was thinking that you have started to love Zara
[02:52] love is one sided, mom
[02:54] and a contract is both sided
[02:58] and I cannot keep anyone associated with me on the basis of a contract
[03:03] think once again, dear
[03:05] think about it very carefully, once again
[03:09] you are incomplete without her
[03:12] and she is incomplete without you
[03:19] mom, when emotions fade away from a relation
[03:23] then nobody feels that who came & who left at what time from your life
[03:30] it won't affect Zara as well, mom
[03:32] mom, I want to set Zara free from this relation
[03:40] what!
[03:41] mom..
[03:43] Zara has tolerated so much of griefs in her life, she has suffered a lot
[03:50] I want to see her happy, mom
[03:53] if she has decided to take a divorce, then I will divorce her
[04:02] so will you get along with Zaini again?
No mom..
[04:05] No
[04:07] Zaini had been a part of my life though
[04:12] but she could never become a good friend
[04:15] she didn't trusted me at that time, when I wanted her trust the most
[04:25] I used to love her, mom
[04:30] but Zara taught me what real love is
[04:37] Love is not about getting someone
[04:40] Love increases by distributing
[04:44] to forget your own self for others
[04:47] this is real love
[04:52] and Zara had taught me all this, mom
[04:59] nobody can take Zara's place in my life
[05:05] and I don't want to betray Zaini
[05:09] by dear, my child..
[05:12] when you love Zara so much, then do you want to loose her?
[05:27] mom...
[05:29] compulsion is more stronger than love
[05:51] but I will try one more time
[05:56] I will try for sure
[06:18] Zara
[06:40] Saad & his mother are here
[06:43] sister wants you to think once again upon your decision
[06:48] but I want to know what your point of view is
[06:53] dad, now I want you to give freedom to Saad to live his life
[07:00] he wasn't at fault at all
[07:02] except for one thing, that he is my friend
[07:09] I have decided after thinking long & hard
[07:13] I won't change my decision
[07:16] ok dear
[07:18] if you are not happy with this relation, then I won't stop you for taking divorce from Saad
[07:28] Let me ask the lawyer to make the documents
[07:48] Zara isn't ready to continue this relation
[08:00] can I meet Zara?
[08:38] you are here?
[08:40] and I was looking for you in the entire house
[08:43] how did you enter here?
[08:46] from this door
[08:48] and you know it very well that I can go to any corner, or room of this house anytime
[08:55] you cannot come here
[08:58] go away from here right away
[08:59] otherwise, I will gather everyone
and if you think that I will get scared this time
[09:03] then its your misunderstanding
[09:08] Wow!
[09:11] you've become very brave while staying with Saad
[09:16] I got scared by seeing this attitude of yours
[09:20] but I am very stubborn!
[09:23] I like you the way you used to be earlier, the innocent, scared one..
[09:29] who used to afraid at all times, right?
[09:32] you won't listen to me like this
[09:33] where are you going?
Where?
[09:36] you had made the same mistake last time as well, by calling Saad
[09:40] what happened then?
[09:41] Saad kept screaming & yelling that he did nothing, but nobody believed him
[09:48] and you were compelled to marry Saad
[09:52] now you are taking divorce from him
[09:56] so what will you do then?
[09:58] what will you do without Saad?
[10:01] how will you spend such a long life alone?
[10:03] stop your rubbish & go away!
[10:05] how can I go like that?
[10:08] I got you with such a difficulty, right?
[10:11] what do you want, why are you after me?
[10:14] I want you, I like you... how shall I tell you that I love you a lot
[10:19] but you are always calling me Adnan uncle, Adnan uncle..
[10:24] stop calling me Adnan uncle
[10:26] you can only take 2 names from your mouth
[10:29] Saad & Adeel
[10:32] but poor Adeel is dead
[10:35] and Saad, he had crossed my path like a black cat (a bad omen)
[10:40] You are crossing your limits! I said leave from here, else I will call Saad
[10:44] Call Saad, what will he do?
[10:48] tell me, what he can do?
[10:49] he did the same thing last time as well, he was screaming & telling the truth but nobody had believed him
[10:57] and even now nobody is going to believe him
[10:59] my poor wife Shaista
[11:02] she also got to know my reality
[11:04] she was saying the same thing to me that I will tell everyone that I have bad intentions for every girl in this family
[11:12] what happened then?
[11:13] I had sent her to her real place
over there..
[11:18] disgusting man!
Ali?
[11:19] how dare you to come to my sister?
[11:20] what? At least listen to me
I will kill you!
[11:23] how dare you!
but Ali...
[11:26] brother!
[11:27] Come with me, come on!
hey Ali, what are you doing?
[11:31] dad, you don't know what this man did
[11:33] he broke our trust & harassed our girls
[11:38] what are you saying?
[11:40] dad, Saad was telling the truth. He had bad intentions for the girls of our family
[11:44] I won't spare him. I will kill him dad!
[11:47] brother, I haven't done any such thing. Don't know what he heard
[11:50] dad, I heard it from his own mouth
[11:52] he tried to harass Zara many times, dad
[11:55] we didn't trusted Saad & Zara by coming into his words, dad
[12:00] we did so wrong, dad
[12:01] you!
[12:03] I had considered you as my little brother, and you...
[12:05] dad, he doesn't deserve it. I will send him to the jail
[12:08] dad, he had killed aunt as well
[12:11] what are you saying, why will I kill my wife? 
Brother, he had a misunderstanding, don't know what rubbish he is uttering
[12:16] Zara, tell me. Look, don't be afraid
[12:19] Tell dad everything truly
[12:22] dad, brother Ali is absolutely correct. This vile man didn't spared his wife as well
[12:27] he had pushed aunt Shaista from the stairs & killed her
[12:31] shameless, vile & murderer!
[12:34] people don't trust others because of the people like you
[12:37] brother, there isn't any such thing. They are having a misunderstanding, I am not that kind of a person. I am like your little..
[12:42] Quiet!
[12:45] I will kill you if you utter a single word
[12:49] brother...
[14:32] what have I done?
[14:35] such a big mistake
[14:37] how could I do such a big mistake?
[14:42] I didn't believed on Saad & Zara
[14:46] what have I done?
[14:48] what have I done?
[14:52] I have lost Saad
[14:55] I have lost Saad
[15:04] I was telling you earlier as well that my son hasn't done anything
[15:08] but you guys didn't trusted me
[15:11] now see, the reality is in front of you all
[15:15] we made a grave mistake, sister
[15:19] forgive us, sister Asfa
don't know what not I had said to you unintentionally
[15:27] Saad
[15:29] dear, you also please forgive us
[15:32] aunty please
[15:35] don't apologize
[15:37] I know, whatever you did. You did by coming into brother Adnan's words
[15:42] whatever happened, was due to misunderstanding
[15:45] but we should have trusted you
[15:51] we did a grave mistake
[15:56] you had always respected me as a father and..
[16:00] I couldn't fulfill your honor
[16:06] uncle, sometimes we feel our existence very useless
[16:12] when you cannot give those values to your loved ones
[16:18] which you give them
[16:22] but I have learnt one thing in all these circumstances, uncle
[16:26] that don't keep a lot of expectations from anyone
[16:30] otherwise you get hurt
[16:36] you are right, Saad
[16:39] We had high hopes with you, that you'll support my family as a son in my absence
[16:45] you will support us in every happy & sad times
[16:49] and when you got into trouble, then I was the first person who had doubted you
[16:58] I feel ashamed, Saad
[17:01] I'm sorry, please forgive me
[17:04] forget it
[17:07] but I am happy that...
[17:12] whatever misunderstandings you people had in your heart
[17:16] are over today
[17:19] and I want to end all these things today & right away
[17:26] we did a very big injustice with you unintentionally
[17:36] its not possible to repent it but...
[17:40] now whatever you want
[17:44] we will do like that
[17:49] whatever will be Zara's decision, will be my decision too
[17:56] I won't have an objection on whatever Zara wants
[18:23] mom
[18:28] mom, my flight to Australia is booked
[18:33] I will go by next week
[18:41] mom
[18:42] won't you say anything to me?
[18:48] you can go wherever you want to, Mirha
[18:53] but stay happy
[18:55] so mom, I will call you both over there after going
[19:05] this house has the fragrance of your father & my son, Mirha
[19:14] I won't go anywhere by leaving this house
[19:22] mom, I will miss you a lot
[19:31] go & fulfill your father & your brother's dream, Mirha
[19:38] study a lot
[19:41] and become very successful
[19:44] my prayers are with you
[19:49] I will do that for sure, mom
[20:09] sister Mahi, you have to take very good care of mom
[20:25] you also take care
[20:35] if possible then please forgive me, Mirha
[20:38]  forgive me, Mirha
[20:44] please forgive me, Mirha
[22:28] hello!
[22:33] when do I have to meet?
[22:36] okay
[22:38] I will come
[22:40] bye!
[22:48] when did I said that he was not your friend?
[22:57] the beginning of love is also based upon friendship, right?
[23:02] I had understood it
[23:06]  but Saad have understood it now
[23:13] the condition in which I saw Mahi, I had forgiven her the same day
[23:20] thank you so much for the way you have helped her after ignoring everything
[23:26] but who were those people, & why they did that?
[23:30] I don't know how Mahi became friends with them, but it was a complete gang
[23:35] they trap innocent girls in their trap in the same manner
[23:39] also he was involved in a lot of harassment cases too
[23:44] but there is no need to worry now. As I have got that guy & his friends arrested red handed
[23:51] Mahi doesn't have any danger from them anymore
[23:54] Can I know, why are you doing all this?
[23:59] On that day, I didn't feel good to see Mahi in that condition
[24:04] maybe, somewhere I am also responsible that she got astray
[24:08] I was just trying to rectify my mistake
[24:11] so that I can get back my value in Mahi's eyes, that I had lost with my own hands
[24:17] that's why I have called you here, so that I can take your help
[24:23] do you still like Mahi?
[24:25] Mahi was the first girl who came into my life
[24:28] I want her to forgive me
[24:31] I tried to contact her many times after that incident
[24:35] I wanted to tell her my feelings
[24:38] but she didn't picked my call
[24:41] maybe her wounds are still fresh
[24:45] few wounds takes time to heal
[24:47] but I want to heal Mahi's all wounds
[24:50] and I would be needing your help in it
[24:53] I also came here with a desire that I will convince you..
[24:58] to think about Mahi
Mahi is such a nice girl
[25:02] but the circumstances had made her stone-hearted
[25:06] she is scared of trusting anyone
[25:10] Mahi thinks that her trust will break
[25:15] maybe... she couldn't tell you about her previous marriage because of this fear
[25:22] whether I want it or not, what difference does it make?
[25:25] until you don't think this way
[25:30] even earlier your parents took your life's decision
[25:34] Can't you make this decision yourself?
[25:37] if you really love Mahi, then can't you convince your family for Mahi?
[26:03] you!
[26:07] please come
[26:28] for what you guys have come now?
[26:31] we made a mistake, sister
[26:34] we came to apologize to you
[26:39] sister, I know...
[26:41] you are still upset with us
[26:44] and your anger is valid
[26:48] but... right now we are here to apologize & to make one request
[26:57] with a hope that you will start a new beginning by forgetting the mistakes of the past
[27:08] and you will forgive us
[27:11] we are not left with anything anymore, Mr. Noor Alam
[27:17] the person because of whom you had brought the proposal, even that person had died
[27:25] so what's the need for all this drama?
[27:28] are you here to make fun of us?
[27:32] No sister, no.. we aren't here to make fun of you
[27:39] we are really embarrassed upon our actions
[27:45] honestly speaking, Ahmed had asked me many times to tell you the entire truth
[27:53] but I hid this matter, it was all my mistake
[27:57] let it be, sister
[27:59] why are you hurting yourself by recalling it?
[28:02] even today, Zaviyar loves Mahi the same way he used to love her earlier
[28:07] believe me, we tried very hard to fix his marriage with someone else
[28:12] but his heart couldn't remove Mahi's memories
[28:15] and today when Zara made us realize that...
Zara?
[28:20] Yes! Don't you know, Zara had explained Zaviyar & opened our eyes
[28:28] she made us realize that how wrong we were
[28:31] actually aunty, I met sister Zara at the hospital
[28:35] I had realized my mistake there & then, in fact I was coming to you guys to apologize
[28:42] but I stopped, when I got to know about uncle's death
[28:45] believe me sister, there are very less people in this world who cares about others
[28:52] your son was really lucky, who got a wife like Zara
[28:58] just forget all the past related matters
[29:02] and give us the date, we are here to seek Mahi's proposal
[29:08] and this time, all the wedding ceremonies will be held in our house
[30:02] Zara
[30:07] why do you want to do this?
[30:13] what do you think?
[30:15] can you return Saad to me by doing this?
[30:23] Zara...
[30:25] Saad was never mine
[30:29] he used to love you
[30:33] but... that stupid guy had never realized
[30:38] that what he used to feel for you, was love or friendship
[30:49] Zaini
[30:52] he was just my friend
[30:58] when did I said that he was not your friend?
[31:06] the beginning of love is also based upon friendship, right?
[31:11] I had understood it
[31:15] but Saad have understood it now
[31:20] Zaini
[31:23] give me some time
[31:27] I will fix everything
[31:30] I will fix everything, I promise!
[31:34] I haven't come to you with a complaint
[31:39] in fact, I have come to tell you
[31:46] I don't need Saad
[31:51] I don't want to marry him
[31:56] and...
[31:59] neither Saad wants this
[32:10] Zaini, I don't love you
[32:17] I love Zara
[32:22] I didn't come here to hurt you
[32:27] I just came to tell you that whatever Zara is doing, its all by her own will
[32:36] and Zara is doing this all for you
[32:39] but I can't be disloyal to Zara even after leaving her
[32:46] I had never been disloyal to you as well
[32:50] there wasn't any fault in my love earlier, nor today
[32:57] but...
[33:00] maybe it was destined to happen
[33:06] our companionship wasn't written in our fate
[33:12] but the relation fate had given to me & Zara
[33:15] I will fulfill it till my last breath
[33:28] when love gets divided...
[33:34] then it doesn't comes in anyone's share
[33:41] Saad never gave me any hope
[33:44] he never gave me any hope
[33:50] but don't loose him for me
[33:56] you have already lost brother Adeel
[33:59] but... don't make a mistake of loosing Saad
[34:09] he will keep you very happy
[34:12] I promise..
[34:15] I don't have any problem with your relation anymore
[34:19] because I have accepted
[34:24] therefore, now you also accept it
[34:29] Don't let injustice happen with you & Saad anymore
[34:40] life is waiting for you with open arms
[34:49] go back to Saad
[35:01] Ok?
[35:26] Ok sir, I will forward you its presentation soon
[35:30] thank you!
[35:31] Ms. Zaini, can we sit & talk for a while?
[35:34] yes sir, tell me
[35:40] I wanted to talk to you since a few days but..
[35:44] in fact, even now I don't understand from where I shall start
[35:48] Sir, what do you want to discuss?
[35:52] do you have any problem with my work?
[35:54] No no, your work is really good. In fact, all of our clients are quite impressed by your performance
[36:00] Sir, if this is not the reason then?
[36:06] Zaini... I mean, Ms. Zaini
[36:11] I want to discuss some personal matter with you
[36:16] Sir, I think I should leave.. 
Please, don't take me wrong
[36:20] I won't say anything inappropriate
[36:23] I just want to say something to you
[36:26] Sir, you're trying to say something since long time
[36:30] first decide, whether you want to say or not
[36:39] Okay..
[36:43] I want to marry you
[36:48] what, sir?
[36:50] please, don't take me wrong
[36:53] I like you since I saw you the very first time
[36:58] I thought to tell you later but...
[37:02] yesterday, when I saw you with someone. I thought, what if I might get late
[37:09] please don't take my intention in a wrong manner
[37:15] few years ago..
[37:18] my parents had died in a plane crash
[37:24] after that I am handling my dad's business
[37:29] I was so close to my family
[37:33] when I saw your bond with your father, I thought that..
[37:38] you are a family oriented girl, who always gives first priority to her family
[37:43] Like.. my mom dad
[37:50] Sir, there is a lot of difference in our standard
[37:56] most importantly, what will people think?
That I..
[38:02] No sir, I am so sorry
[38:05] Please, listen to me. I won't say anything inappropriate
[38:10] first I will talk to your family, but I wanted to know that
[38:16] do you like someone?
[38:19] if yes, then its ok. I won't force you
[38:41] he was my past
[38:47] I don't know about your past
[38:51] but I know this for sure, that your eyes will never get teary in the future
[40:44] Zara
[40:47] I won't make promises to you about long life or so..
[40:52] but I will say, I will support you until I am alive
[41:00] I will never ask you to forget Adeel
[41:03] but I will also not tell you to stop living your life
[41:09] I want to fill your life with the colors of love
[41:13] which Adeel wanted to..
[41:16] which I want
[41:19] yes Zara
[41:22] I've started loving you
[41:26] I want to spend my entire life with you
[41:31] so, why didn't you say it earlier?
[41:34] because you haven't said it as well
[41:36] so, say it now
[41:42] how will I stay alive after getting separated from you?
[41:47] you are my life, Zara
[41:50] I won't be able to live without you
[41:55] will you accompany me in this journey?
