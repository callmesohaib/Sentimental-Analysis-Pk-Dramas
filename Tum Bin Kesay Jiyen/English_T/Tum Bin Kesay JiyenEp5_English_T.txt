[01:04] Mom asked about who you were?
[01:08] I told her I didn't know. I just had an accident with your bike.
[01:12] Did she doubt?
[01:14] No. I handled it for now. You tell me, how are you?
[01:20] Let me be. Tell me about yourself.
[01:23] You got hurt more.
No Aqib. I'm fine.
[01:26] The doctor said that the pain will last for a week or so and it'll be fine then. It hurts.
[01:33] Tell me what he said. A week or so is way too much.
[01:36] Aqib, can I lie to you?
[01:41] Are you sure?
What will I get lying to you?
[01:45] But tell me where is your other number. I cannot call the other number.
[01:49] Yes. My mobile fell down.
[01:52] I lost it where I had the accident. Didn't I tell you?
[01:58] Oh. You are in a great loss.
[02:00] It must be around 50 60 thousand.
[02:02] I'm glad that I was safe. I could always buy a new phone.
[02:07] Yes, this is so.
[02:09] If something had happened to you. I wouldn't have forgiven myself.
[02:12] Again that nonsense Aqib. Nothing happened to me. I'm fine.
[02:17] And if something had happened to me, you wouldn't have done it deliberately.
[02:22] Mom's here. I'll talk to you later.
Bye!
[02:36] Who were you talking to?
[02:38] My friend Nageen. She got worried when she found out so she called.
[02:47] Did anyone call from Karachi?
Yes Adeel called.
[02:52] Did Zara talk to you?
[02:53] Yes, Mahi. sister Zara, Adeel, everybody talked to me.
[02:59] Everything to show Adeel.
[03:03] Don't fall for her sympathies. All this is a drama.
[03:07] Had she worried about you so much, she'd have called me.
[03:10] Her parents would have talked to me.
[03:14] But no..
[03:17] They are a family of ill mannered people. God, my son is stuck amongst such careless people.
[03:24] Mom, aunt is calling. Do you want to talk?
[03:27] I have soup cooking for you. Talk to her yourself.
[03:33] Hello? Hello aunt.
[03:35] How are you? I'm fine. A lot better than before.
[04:09] Adeel, I'll help you with the packing.
[04:20] I'm sorry Zara.
[04:26] Adeel.. Perhaps you're forgetting. We promised each other.
[04:33] We decided we'd not fight amongst ourselves because of a third person.
[04:39] Yes I know.
[04:42] But whatever happened, it wasn't right.
[04:48] Everybody is worried because of Mahi.
[04:53] She's also worried because of Mirha.
[04:57] When a person is worried, they don't understand what to do.
[05:01] She doesn't worry about anyone.
[05:05] She only knows how to irritate others.
[05:08] Why are you worrying? As it is, your friend is married now.
[05:15] You had to go back
[05:17] Yes. I did. But not like this.
[05:26] Please don't worry. Everything will be alright. You're going on a journey. Be happy.
[05:47] I promise you, Zara.
[05:57] I'll always keep you happy.
[06:03] I'll not let anybody wrong you again.
[06:07] I have full faith.. on you and on myself.
[06:16] Alright. Talk to aunt.
[06:22] She just gets angry for a little while. I'll make her understand when she talks to me.
[06:42] Mahi is calling.
You talk. I'll leave.
[07:09] Uncle, don't worry. I've arranged for Maham and Adeel's travel.
[07:14] They won't have any problems.
Its a good thing.
[07:18] You always support us. How can I thank you?
[07:23] Uncle, you call me your son and then you want to thank me.
[07:26] May God bless everyone with an obedient son like you.
[07:30] Amen.
[07:33] Alright, I'll take your leave now.
[07:34] No. How can you leave like this? I'll call Zara or Zaini. Have tea.
[07:40] No uncle. Not today.
[07:43] Is everything alright, dear? You've never turned me down.
[07:47] Uncle. I'm helpless today. Mom is not well. I have to take her to the hospital.
[07:54] If I get late, we'll be late then.
[07:56] Oh. No dear. You go ahead. Take care. Bye.
[08:08] May God bless him. Zara..
[08:15] Zaini?
[08:21] Saad?
[08:41] Bye aunt.
Bye. May God keep you safe.
[08:49] Bye uncle.
[08:56] Take care.
[09:04] Okay uncle.
Alright.
[09:08] May you live long. Bless you.
[10:09] Do you understand something about what happened with you?
[10:14] You talk so much and now,
[10:16] when you have to discuss something important, you're quiet Zara.
[10:23] What should I say about it? Whatever is happening is in front of you.
[10:29] Whatever is happening in front of us, there is more happening behind our backs.
[10:33] And you, you're not that stupid. You understand everything.
[10:37] I don't understand what Adeel has fed you that,
[10:42] you cannot even talk to him.
[10:44] Why are you arguing amongst yourselves? Please talk calmly.
[10:49] I'm not arguing. I'm just talking to her.
[10:52] She'll be thinking I'm creating problems without any reason like you feel I react unnecessarily.
[11:00] Now I'm in your list as well?
[11:07] I know what they'll discuss too.
[11:11] Its a girl who has to spend her life once she gets married, not them.
[11:16] Why doesn't she understand?
[11:18] They're not human beings but those mother and daughters are witches. They'll eat her alive.
[11:24] Nothing will happen like this.
[11:27] You're still saying this. I cannot believe it. I'm very upset.
[11:34] See, rather than crying later, its good that you decide now.
[11:40] If Adeel cannot leave them, tell him to shift to Karachi. He can get a house here and live here.
[11:50] Zara what are you thinking?
[11:57] See, I accept that Adeel is a very nice boy and he loves you very much.
[12:02] But what about his family?
[12:05] They will not let you be happy. They'll destroy you.
[12:08] Think about it. You'll have to think about it.
[12:12] Is it right to discuss all this before the wedding?
[12:15] Yes. It is right to talk now. How will listen to this once they're married?
[12:20] Once you're married, he'll start loving his mother and sisters. Boys change in a jiffy.
[12:30] Adeel has promised me that he'll never let me get worried.
[12:34] He'll support me in all situations.
[12:40] And you believed him?
[12:41] I believe Adeel completely. He'll never betray me.
[12:49] Alright. If something bad happens later, don't come to me. I'll not even talk about it.
[12:55] Nothing bad will happen to me.
[12:58] I pray to God that nothing bad happens with you and your trust stays intact.
[13:16] Don't worry. You know she's habitual of speaking without thinking.
[13:24] Please don't worry. Everything will be fine, if God wills.
[13:38] Here's your tea.
[13:47] Have they reached or not?
[13:52] To tell you Manzoor, I didn't really like what Maham did yesterday.
[13:57] Even I'm worried about Zara
[14:01] but you should find out whether they've reached or not.
[14:05] They should have reached by now. Did anybody call?
[14:10] I did try calling twice but the phone was unreachable.
[14:16] Try calling again.
[14:30] I don't understand how you got into an accident.
[14:35] Mom, didn't I tell you?
[14:37] I got hit by bike.
Mom.. aunt is calling.
[14:41] Don't answer. I don't want to talk.
[14:43] Mom, it'll be fun. Throw in a few taunts.
[14:50] Hello?
Hello.
[14:53] Hello. So you miss me now?
[14:58] Is everything alright?
[15:00] I tried calling earlier as well but your number was unreachable.
[15:04] Really?
[15:07] I don't know.
[15:08] My phone was switched on. You're talking on the same number.
[15:13] Yes. Maybe there was a network problem.
[15:21] By the way Sarwat, you're older and elder than your brother
[15:26] but you couldn't call after the accident.
[15:31] You're calling after 24 hours to get done with the formality.
[15:38] Its great.
[15:41] Have you forgotten that this isn't your brother's house only but your daughter's in laws as well?
[15:49] Do you remember or not?
[15:51] Trust me, I tried calling you twice to ask you about the kids.
[15:56] I called Mirha then. I talked to her. You can ask her.
[16:01] Yes. Mirha told me.
So how is Mirha now?
[16:06] She's fine, thank God.
[16:08] I don't know who was the wretched person to cast an evil eye on my daughter.
[16:14] Have the children reached safely?
[16:16] Yes. They're here.
[16:19] Alright. I called to ask this only. Bye.
[16:29] She was acting so innocent. God knows how people put up such dramas.
[16:33] She's very clever. Not innocent at all.
[16:47] Has everyone reached safely?
Yes they have.
[16:53] What did she say?
[16:55] Nothing much.
[17:03] Is your tea cold? Should I heat it up?
Yes. No. I'm drinking it.
[17:36] You look upset.
[17:37] Its nothing. I'm not upset.
[17:40] Why are you asking me the same question again and again? Whats your problem?
[19:09] I didn't insult anyone. I said the truth.
[19:14] I just said what was in my heart.
[19:18] I'm not two faced like your mother in law. She's always humming. Oh God save us..
[19:29] If she didn't call right after the accident, why did she call 24 hours later when you people had reached home?
[19:42] Tell me. Don't you understand all this?
[19:48] Are you watching Mahi, how clever that woman is?
[19:52] Mom, don't include them with you. You're enough, alone.
[19:57] And if she did call late, what is the big issue?
[20:01] Its not about the call but about the importance and closeness.
[20:08] The entire world will call after two three days to inquire. People will come according to their suitable time and ask how she's doing.
[20:17] Family doesn't do this.
[20:20] Adeel, don't mind.
[20:23] Your in laws didn't even follow the traditions.
[20:28] We were coming back from their place.
[20:30] Someone could have come along, but they didn't think it was important.
[20:35] Even when we had place for two people in the car.
Exactly..
[20:41] This is the entire thing.
[20:43] But his mind will never understand this because he's blindfolded by love.
[20:51] God knows what that wretched girl has done to him that my son...
[20:56] You called Zara wretched? Your daughter in law...
[21:01] Whats wrong with you? What are you saying?
[21:03] What should I say? I'll call her what she is.. Wretched.
[21:10] Its the limit. I told you not to go there. I told you.
[21:13] I had a dream. I knew there's be a problem if you go there. Do you see now?
[21:19] There is the problem.
For God's sake mom.. Its enough.
[21:26] I respect you, earn some respect.
[21:29] Zara respects you like she respects her mother.
What do you mean?
[21:34] You're threatening mom that you'll insult her? You'll not respect her
[21:37] .
Whats wrong? Enough. Stop it.
[21:40] No Mahi.. you didn't actually understand him. He is talking about that madam Zara.
[21:50] He is trying to scare me that if I say anything bad to Zara, she'll misbehave with me and insult me.
[22:01] And she'll make him hit me with shoes.
[22:05] I will break off her hands.
[22:08] If she even looks my mother in the eye..
Enough!
[22:13] I've heard enough of what you've said. Not anymore.
[22:31] Are you looking at him? Are you looking at his attitude?
[22:35] He's lost his mind in love!
[22:38] Mom.. he's right. Aunt called. She talked to me.
[22:43] When I handed over the phone to you, you cut the call.
[22:47] Shut your mouth. Shut up. You're not well.
[22:54] The bandage is wrong. They should have bandaged her mouth.
[22:57] You should have gotten an X-ray of her brain as well. Her nuts and bolts have become loose.
[23:01] I'm telling the truth.
Shut up and eat your apple quietly.
[23:06] My own children are ready to back stab me.
[23:35] I'm really worried Saad.
[23:37] Adeel told me that aunt and Mahi didn't like me but they actually hate me.
[23:48] So what have you thought?
[23:50] What can I think Saad, I don't understand.
[23:56] Don't you think Maheen is right?
[24:01] What if Adeel shifts here with you?
[24:03] Saad, this isn't suitable. this will nurture more hatred.
[24:07] They'll have a reason to hate me. Aren't you thinking about Adeel?
[24:12] It will be difficult for him to leave his family for me. This isn't easy Saad.
[24:18] And will Adeel tolerate whatever will happen in that house with you?
[24:24] And you will also be leaving your parents and your family.
[24:27] When you can leave, why can't he come?
[24:29] Because its always the girl who leaves. They have to go.
[24:33] Girls don't just go. Their in laws take them along lovingly but its different in your case.
[24:42] And as it is, you get married to the boy, not her family.
[24:46] Saad you're talking like Maheen now.
[24:48] There's no option otherwise.
[24:51] You only get to live once. If you don't take the right decision at the right time,
[24:56] then you have to regret all your life.
[25:04] I cannot live without Adeel.
[25:08] Who is asking you to live without him?
[25:11] But you can talk to him.
[25:14] Has he ever turned you down?
[25:18] Talk to him. He'll listen to you.
[25:49] I'd say you should go and talk.
[25:53] So much insult upon not calling.
[25:57] I did call. I talked to Mirha after her accident.
[26:01] Her mother didn't come on the phone. Then I called her again at night.
[26:07] It kept ringing but she didn't answer. I thought she might be in the hospital.
[26:12] Quite a few times there's a signal problem.
[26:17] This means, she created the issue herself.
[26:20] The actual thing is something else.
[26:22] This is what I'm saying Shaista.
[26:25] Nothing such had happened that Mahi and her mother created such a big scene.
[26:30] Please don't mind but..
[26:33] Its not Mirha's foot that was fractured but Fareeda's heart
[26:38] and when there's a crack in a mirror or a heart, it just never goes.
[26:54] Please don't cry, be quiet. If there is a problem, we'll find a way. If God wills. Be quiet.
[27:05] My daughter is like a flower Shaista. What will become of her?
[27:10] Don't worry. We're with you. In fact, don't worry.
[27:17] Lets go and talk to Manzoor. Where is he? He'll find a solution.
[27:23] He went to get rent for the shops.
[27:26] Its another problem. The shopkeepers keep saying the market is slow,
[27:30] they cannot manage rent. What can we do?
[27:34] Should we just give away the shops for free? Where will we eat from? Problems are surrounding us..
[27:50] Everything will be alright, don't cry.
[28:04] My heart is just anxious. What can I do?
[28:20] I want to know what you think, dear.
[28:24] This is your life.
[28:27] We'll not decide anything without your consent.
[28:33] Don't take any pressure and tell me.
[28:41] You've just signed the marriage contract for now.
[28:44] Had you been living with him, I'd have said the same thing.
[28:52] This marriage is a union of two families. We look into the boy's family as well.
[29:07] You don't have to spend your life with Adeel only.
[29:10] His family should also have a place for you in their hearts or else it'll be a problem.
[29:18] Adeel has promised me dad. He will take care of me.
[29:23] He'll not mistreat me because of his family.
[29:30] So will Adeel's support be enough for you?
[29:34] Tell me.
[29:38] We need everything in life, dear.
[29:42] Homes are built with relationships.
[29:47] Mom says if your husband supports you, nothing else matters.
[29:53] Whether someone else is with us.
[29:56] The same thing happened with you and mom.
[30:00] You've always supported mom.
[30:03] You don't have any complaints against each other. We're all so happy, dad.
[30:12] I'm your daughter.
[30:15] I have learned to stay put. I promise you, dad.
[30:20] You'll never get a chance to complain because of me.
[30:26] If this is your final decision then,
[30:30] don't make such a promise to me.
[30:35] But instead, promise me that if there is any problem in that house, you'll complain to me. You'll tell me.
[30:43] This is your house,
[30:46] today, tomorrow and once you're married as well. You have a right on this house.
[30:54] I'm your father.
[31:01] I don't believe in shutting my door on my daughters once they get married.
[31:12] You will not tolerate his family's mistreatment for your husband's love. Promise me this.
[31:23] I promise you, dad. I'll do as you say.
[31:34] I, want to discuss something with you.
[31:39] Yes, tell me.
[31:43] Dad, these matters will arise again. Before matters go worse, I want to settle everything.
[31:55] I'll handle everything, dad.
[32:12] Please get me married.
[32:55] I have told dad to get me married, I'll handle everything else.
[33:01] Did you tell him yourself?
[33:03] Uncle would have minded it.
Why would he? I didn't say anything wrong.
[33:09] Yes its not wrong but Zara, if girls talk about their weddings, people mind.
[33:16] This is why I'm asking you.
[33:19] Now tell me, did uncle say something to you?
He's my dad and I know him well.
[33:27] He isn't that conservative, that's why I told him.
[33:32] You shouldn't have talked directly. You should have told me and I'd have talked through dad.
[33:38] And as it is, I had to talk to dad.
[33:41] Adeel, you don't realize. Everybody was afraid here
[33:47] and their fear was scaring me.
[33:50] I felt someone might take a wrong decision.
[33:56] Why would someone take a wrong decision, Zara.
[33:59] This is our life.
[34:04] We have the right to decide.
[34:09] And if someone feels they can create distance between us with such cheap things, they're mistaken.
[34:17] I will not let this happen, ever.
[34:20] And even you know this.
[34:23] Why are you afraid then?
[34:29] See, don't be scared. I'm here. Everything will be alright.
[34:38] Adeel, I've told dad that you've promised to stand by me and take care of me.
[34:48] Then?
[34:53] I will never be embarrassed in front of dad
[34:57] and I'll never want dad to be embarrassed in front of me.
[35:06] I will never think about anything else in front of my dad's respect.
[35:12] Zara, why are you thinking all this? I'm here.
[35:17] I'll fix everything. You don't have to think all this, while I'm here? Then..
[35:29] Yes. I know it very well.
[35:33] Now I'm getting late for office. I'll call you from there.
[35:38] Sorry, I didn't realize. It was time for you to go.
[35:43] Its okay. You go and work. Call me if you get time or else we'll talk at night.
[35:51] No. I'll call you. I have to talk to you.
Okay. Bye.
[35:59] Bye.
[36:21] Its the limit mom. You're cooking peas and rice here and there, Zara is doing everything.
[36:26] Why?
[36:28] What happened? What did she do?
[36:29] She talked to her dad that she couldn't wait anymore and he should get her married.
[36:33] Oh God... May God's wrath be on her... She said this? To her own father?
[36:43] Mahi... what age is this? Girls have become so bold? 
[36:48] Will they now ask their parents to get them married?
[36:51] Sorry to say but this is being shameless and not bold.
[36:54] And I have just heard about her being shameless with my own ears. 
[36:57] She was telling Adeel about what she did.
What did he say then?
[37:02] What did Adeel say?
[37:03] What would he say? He's getting his heart's desire.
[37:07] This means that Zara will be deciding when she's going to come to my house?
[37:14] I mean, Adeel is my son. I'll decide when and how his wedding will be.
[37:21] I'll talk to Adeel and Zara myself..
[37:24] No mom. You don't have to talk to anyone, right now.
[37:28] Why shouldn't I? 
[37:31] She hasn't come to this house yet and she's taking decisions. How dare she?
[37:37] Mom, I'm not telling you not to talk. But this isn't the right time. 
[37:42] Let aunt talk to Adeel then you can say whatever you want.
[37:47] They don't have anything special that they'll talk to your dad about his daughter's wedding. 
[37:51] Adeel will talk to your father and your father will talk to them about the wedding.
[37:57] You don't understand.
[37:58] They already have. Uncle told me that since my parents didn't come, they'd discuss the wedding with me.
[38:06] Oh God.. now this will happen?
[38:10]  What did you say? Why didn't you tell me?
[38:14]  Why did they even talk to you about it?
[38:17] They've killed me while I'm alive. They will now discuss weddings with the kids.
[38:27] Your father is talking to you.. the girl is talking to the boy..Where am I in all this?
[38:32]  Had you told me at that time, I'd have set them straight, really well.
[38:40] See mom, I'm telling you. Its not the time to talk. 
[38:43] Let aunt and uncle talk to you first. Why get dirty yourself?
[38:48] They'll not talk.
[38:50] Your father will talk and you'll see the wedding will take place. You can write it down.
[38:56] They will talk.
[38:58] They will ask themselves and fall down themselves. Write it down somewhere. This will happen.
[39:06] Oh God.. Oh God.. What is happening?
[39:12] Even I don't understand..
[39:14] Nothing like this happened in my time. You were so strict.
[39:18] This girl is a hurricane of disasters.
