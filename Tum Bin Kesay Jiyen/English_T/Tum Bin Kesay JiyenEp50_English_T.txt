[00:12] For a father if his daughters become his weakness...
[00:16]  then that is enough for a father to be buried alive.
[00:22] If my sister can by punished then why not your sister?
[00:27] That's what you said, right auntie?
[00:29]  If your son could get away with destroying my sisters' lives...
[00:34] then we will not take long in breaking this relationship.
[00:38] You not only degraded your father, but also your family and proved...
[00:45] that your father failed in carving out a diamond...
[00:50] What I thought was a diamond was an ordinary stone
[04:47] Zaini!

mom, do you know
[07:45] I used to tell Saad to stay away from Zara, as I don't like it
[07:51] but he didn't listen to me at all, mom
[07:55] Saad never loved me Saad, mom
He had always loved Zara
[08:00] mom...

[10:40] why did you come upstairs?
[10:42] I came here just like that, what happened?
[10:44] come, lets go downstairs
[10:45] what will I do by going downstairs? She had to leave after the wedding so its done
[10:48] now shall I go & drop them home?
[10:50] she didn't go after the wedding
[10:51] why? Did Saad refuse to take Zara with him?
[10:54] God! don't know why do you think this way yourself? Why will he refuse?
[10:58] he himself wanted to marry her
[11:00] then tell me why the departure ritual didn't happen as of yet?
[11:04] because a new drama has started downstairs
[11:08] sister Fareeda & Mahi is here
[11:10] they have come?
[11:10] what do you mean?
[11:11] I mean, why did they come here at this time?
[11:16] how would I know Adnan, that why they've come?
[11:19] I came upstairs to call you, lets go & check what the issue is
[11:22] come quickly, hurry up
[11:40] hello!
[11:42] who is this speaking?
[11:43] this is Adnan speaking
[11:45] I didn't recognize, who Adnan?
[11:46] hey Adnan, Adnan uncle!
[11:49] oh! Adnan uncle?
[11:51] from where did you get my number?
[11:53] its not a very big deal to get the number nowadays
[11:57] and dear, you are already like my children. So I can call you anytime
[12:02] why did you call me, do you have any work for me?
[12:04] yes, you can be of my work
[12:06] what's the matter, why are you beating about the bush? Come to the point
[12:12] this is problem of you girls, you are so impatient!
[12:17] your sister-in-law Zara is exactly like you
[12:20] she does everything very hastily
[12:22] she did haste in getting married to your brother & now she is getting married to Saad hastily as well
[12:27] Saad's marriage?
[12:29] yes Zara is getting married to Saad, and today is their departure ritual
[12:32] I don't know, tell me clearly
[12:34] what? you don't know?
[12:38] Oh, so sister didn't even tell you? I thought you guys are close relatives so she must have told you
[12:43] but anyways, how come she would have told you?
[12:47] anyways... Zara is getting married to Saad & today is their departure ritual
[12:54] with Saad?
[13:03] hello?
[13:06] here you go...
[13:10] the work is done
[13:16] mom!
[13:28] you took so long in coming
[13:32] lets go & see
[13:35] oh God, did you see Mahi? She got married in real
[13:41] I used to say it earlier as well, but you never used to believe on my words
[13:46] she never wanted to stay with us, in fact she was staying there forcefully
[13:50] She wanted to get married to this guy after coming here
[13:53] you are so shameless though, did you feel any shame or so?
[13:58] at least you could have kept the honor of my son's demise
[14:02] not only a few days have passed to his death
[14:06] if you had to marry this guy then why did you get married to my son?
[14:11] why you did a false drama of love with him? Why you did false promises?
[14:15] tell me
[14:16] aunty please believe me I've done nothing. even today I love Adeel. I haven't done anything
[14:23] really?
[14:24] the veil of innocence that you put on your face, it cannot hide the ugliness of character
[14:33] didn't you feel ashamed while doing all this?
[14:38] sister Fareeda
[14:39] you shall keep your mouth shut, Sarwat
[14:42] you used to talk so big, right?
[14:45] you used to claim so big, that my daughters are like this.. my daughters are like that
[14:49] then what is all this happening now?
[14:51] yes? Why you've married your daughter with this guy secretly?
[14:56] who told you this?
[14:58] whoever told me, he did very well
[15:01] otherwise, you guys wouldn't have given us a hint
[15:05] your brother never gets tired of praising you
[15:10] he always used to tell good stories about you, that my sister did great upbringing of her daughters
[15:17] is this how you've done the brought up?
[15:19] your one daughter had married the fiance of your other daughter
[15:26] you guys should drown somewhere & die
[15:29] mom you are absolutely correct, all of you should die
[15:33] she was caught with that guy when she was there, still she didn't get peace so she did this with him. Oh God forgive me
[15:40] Mahi, why are you interfering in this matter?
[15:42] why? Why I shouldn't speak?
Oh! obviously you'll speak
[15:46] because you are also characterless like your sister
[15:49] Mahi, you are crossing your limits!
[15:51] don't even try
[16:13] Fareeda
[16:16] Fareeda
[16:21] Fareeda
[16:23] Fareeda
[16:31] Mahi
[16:34] Mahi..
[16:38] don't know where they have gone
[16:42] you've raised your hand today, if you ever tried it again then I will break your arm
[16:47] what is this drama going on?
Why aren't you guys leaving?
[16:53] brother, its better for you to stay quiet
[16:57] you should have kept a control on your daughters, I won't bear the insult every time
[17:05] enough sister
[17:06] for God sake please don't make a spectacle anymore
[17:10] you have complaint against me that I haven't done the right brought up of my daughter, I agree
[17:16] that I made a mistake, sister
[17:20] but not anymore, sister
[17:24] mom, please don't cry
are we making a drama?
[17:28] wow wow! and whatever she did over there?
[17:32] she got us defamed in the entire neighborhood, we cannot face anyone at all
[17:37] what about that?
[17:38] my daughter's marriage was called off because of this wretched girl 
and you are saying that I am creating a drama
[17:45] wow wow!
[17:47] sister Fareeda, whatever you want to talk about please sit & talk. This is not the right time to create a spectacle
[17:53] you should stay quiet, sister
[17:55] they have shut your mouth by feeding you a lot of money
[17:59] that's why, you are standing here shamelessly although a lot had happened
[18:05] and if this guy wasn't at fault then he wouldn't have married her ever
[18:12] the limit!
[18:14] I mean, so much of selfishness! That in order to achieve your motive you guys have sell off your concience
[18:21] I understand the people of your nature very well
[18:25] enough aunty!
[18:29] not a single word
[18:33] sister Asfa, please take Zara away from here
[18:38] and don't get me more humiliated, please
[18:42] wow brother wow! this is great. We are taking your daughter from here with complete respect
[18:49] but we didn't know that we'll get so much insulted here
[18:53] we have to pay a very hefty price
[18:56] instead of asking them to leave, you are asking us to leave?
[19:03] you guys have put very big false allegations on my son
[19:06] but you'll see, one day you will be proved wrong & then I will ask both the families
[19:13] brother, you have done so many favors on me
[19:17] and I'm indebted to you, I cannot come out of it even if I want to
[19:21] but you'll see
[19:23] fear about that day when the truth will come in front of all
[19:29] oh wow... wow, means a person shall learn how to do a drama about innocence
[19:39] lets go mom, we already have to go very far
[19:43] and now there is no point, as she has already got married
[19:48] Okay
[19:50] I am leaving, Sarwat
[19:52] but always remember my words, your daughter will never stay happy
[20:00] its a curse of a mother!
[20:02] Its a mother's curse, this girl will swerve for happiness. She will never be happy. you'll see
[20:10] lets go mom, please
[20:17] mom, please control yourself
[20:20] please get a grip on yourself
[21:10] Zara wanted to meet you
[21:15] but I don't want to meet her
[21:19] she is our bloodline, Mr. Manzoor
[21:24] This is the reason I am disappointed
[21:32] that how can my bloodline be so dirty?
[21:53] dad
[21:55] yes dad?
[21:56] yes Mirha, do you know where your mother & sister had gone?
[22:02] No dad, why what happened?
[22:04] dear, I came home but nobody is at home
[22:07] nobody had called me as well, did they tell you where they are going?
[22:12] dad, mom had asked me to stay at home due to a religious gathering
[22:17] but I had an important class due to which I couldn't miss my university
[22:21] that's fine dear, but I don't understand that where they have gone. Can you find out?
[22:27] Ok let me ask Sadaf to call her mom & ask. Maybe, she has gone to her
[22:32] Okay dear, do let me know whatever it is
[22:36] Okay, bye!
[22:38] Okay dear
[22:47] weird people! At least they could have messaged me
[22:53] what happened, Mirha?
[22:54] dad was worried, please call your mom & ask
[22:58] maybe my mother has gone there
[23:19] come in
[23:21] today on wards this is your room
[23:28] you have to live in this room now
[26:52] Mr. Manzoor
[26:55] yes?
[26:58] until when you'll keep sitting like this?
[27:03] has everyone left?
[27:07] yes, its been 2 hours now
[27:09] everyone has gone
[27:15] Okay
[27:17] why you went inside?
[27:22] I wasn't able to face the people
[27:25] Zara wanted to meet you
[27:31] but I don't want to meet her
[27:35] she is our bloodline, Mr. Manzoor
[27:39] this is the reason I am disappointed
[27:47] that how can my bloodline be so dirty?
[27:57] I haven't done this kind of her brought up
[28:05] I had always loved her the most
[28:16] and she broke my trust
[28:22] she got me insulted in front of the entire world
[28:32] and the guy whom I had trusted blindly
[28:39] he had robbed my family
[28:41] they say, a person gets betrayed the most from that person whom he trusts the most
[28:50] you are right
[28:54] absolutely correct!
[28:57] I made a mistake in recognizing him
[29:02] now sister Fareeda will tell this to each & every person
[29:06] let her tell
[29:09] tell her to inform everyone
[29:14] what's left with us to hide now?
[29:30] whatever respect we had earned in years, is ruined now
[29:40] now whatever people say
[29:45] our respect will not come back
[29:57] also Zara will never step in this house ever
[30:05] the doors of this house are closed for her forever
[30:16] if any person of this family tried to meet her or talk to her
[30:31] then nobody will be as bad as me
[31:03] Greetings dad!
[31:07] where were both of you?
[31:09] actually we have gone for shopping
[31:11] and our rickshaw broke on our way back, that's why we got late
[31:14] was it the world's last rickshaw? that you couldn't get any other?
[31:17] you could have taken another rickshaw and come back home
[31:20] do you have an idea that how much Mirha & I was worried
[31:23] yes, that's why we came after fixing everything
[31:29] fix? What do you mean?
[31:30] Means, it took a little bit of time to get the rickshaw fixed
[31:33] also there was a signal problem else we would have called & inform you.
Correct!
[31:37] really?
[31:38] hey Mirha, are you back from university? Did you eat anything?
[31:42] I couldn't remember to do anything in the tension of you both
[31:45] I had also called Sadaf's mom to ask, whether you might have gone to her
[31:49] why did you call her?
[31:51] she might have told this in the entire neighborhood. Are we kids that we might have got lost?
[31:55] don't know what she must be thinking
[31:57] yes, what else?
[31:58] ts nothing like that, in fact she was saying that maybe you guys have...
[32:02] yes yes! actually she had told us about the sale. So mom & I had gone to see that
[32:08] but your hands are empty
[32:10] yes! actually we didn't like anything that's why we haven't bought
[32:15] do one thing, lets go with us tomorrow maybe you like something. Right mom?
[32:21] yes... this is a good idea
[32:25] now leave this topic & get freshen up
[32:29] and Mirha, please serve the dinner as its already very late
[32:32] Ok
[32:33] Okay then
[36:54] I have sent her to his room with so much of difficulty
[36:57] she never wanted to go inside
[36:59] mom, now do you understand why I used to say that brother shouldn't visit there so frequently?
[37:03] how would I know that they'll do all this with him?
[37:08] and then Ali didn't do good as well
[37:10] he shouldn't have said such a big thing from his mouth
[37:13] mom, they have compelled brother to get married to her by taking advantage of this matter
[37:17] don't know maybe this was written in my son's fate
[37:20] No mom, nothing as such was written in brother's fate whatever is happening
[37:24] they have removed the burden of their head, can't you see?
[37:28] didn't you see, how aunt Fareeda was insulting Zara. It means she must have done something over there as well that's why they've sent her here
[37:35] and what Zara did? She had blamed brother after coming here
[37:38] what not brother did for Zara in his life?
[37:41] I wasn't expecting this from Zara at all
[37:45] she got me into a loss along with her
[37:47] she has ruined her life, alongside she had made my life a living hell as well
[37:50] and what Ali did?
[37:52] as if Ali can't see me
[37:55] did Ali said something? Did he took stand for me? No!
[37:59] he was just standing there & looking at the spectacle
[38:03] I can never forgive Zara
[38:06] I can never forgive her
[38:08] it seems as if Ali can't see me in front of his sisters. As if I don't exist
[38:14] dear, what's done is done
[38:17] now Zara is the daughter-in-law of this family, she has to live here
[38:21] mom
[38:23] Zara is not the daughter-in-law of this family
[38:26] if you want to accept her as your daughter-in-law
[38:29] you can
[38:30] but Zara can never be my sister-in-law
[38:34] the limit!
[38:34] Dolly! At least listen to me
[38:40] oh God, what shall I do?
