[00:21] Open you eyes, look how beautiful you look.
[00:26] So much makeup, I don't look good at all.
[00:31] Doesn't it look good. You look pretty.
[00:34] The kilos of makeup you've applied on your face...
[00:38] because of that we can't see your face. Did you do it yourself?
[00:43] Auntie what's wrong with you?
[00:45] You are insulting my sister-in-law.
[00:48] Zara, go upstairs.
Mother, she's worried, and she's not telling me.
[00:55] Why don't you ask her?
[00:58] She would have told you something if there was something.
[01:05] You have always been skeptical of sister-in-law and Mahi.
[02:37] Greetings* How are you?
[02:41] I'm well, how are you? Did auntie Shaista not come?
[02:44] She's at home doing the laundry. The entire house has left to visit Zara's in-laws.
[02:50] Why didn't you guys go?
[02:52] No one asked us. They asked Shaista to clean the house and left.
[03:00] It's your in-laws, but I can't lie.
[03:03] It's alright, please come inside.
[03:06] How's your mother? She wasn't well at the wedding.
[03:09] Mother is doing well now, she's resting at home.
[03:15] If she's resting then I won't disturb her.
[03:18] You can reach us on Shaista's number, you can call me and I'll come over.
[03:20] What are you saying? Come inside and sit, I'll make a delicious cup of tea.
[03:31] Make Adeel understand. It won't look good if there's no reception.
[03:39] Come on! He's adamant on not having one
[03:44] . I want my home to feel some joy as well.
[03:48] He's my only son make him understand.
[03:52] I don't know what to make him understand. This is a matter of your home.
[03:58] What are you saying?
[04:04] You've made us strangers after marrying your daughter.
[04:08] You've forgotten that you have one more relationship in this house.
[04:15] Zara and I decided beforehand that we would distribute the reception dinner at an orphanage.
[04:24] If you want to invite someone, then you can by inviting them home for dinner.
[04:33] He's right. For our happiness...
[04:39] we spend million to feed others.
[04:44] It won't matter if we don't do that.
[04:47] Rather, they can join us for dinner.
[04:52] By God's good grace, you kindness is killing me.
[04:57] Do you all see? Look how well we've raised our son.
[05:03] He won all arguments by using a single statement.
[05:09] He has said something that I can't say more. It's settled then.
[05:16] There will be no reception.
[05:20] No... there will be a reception, but not like it usually happens.
[05:28] Am I right son?
[05:34] I think Maheen wants to say something, go ahead.
[05:41] I don't want to say anything and I don't need anyone's permission to say anything. Understand?
[05:50] You're taking it the wrong way. I thought you wanted to say something...
[05:54] I'm sorry if you mind.
[05:58] I don't care what you think, right now I don't want to say anything to anyone.
[06:03] Can someone please ask me what I think.
[06:05] I think the tea has gone cold.
[06:08] You think the tea is cold. Mahi heat the tea for your brother.
[06:14] No... there is no need to go.
[06:16] Why don't you hold it for a while... I'm sure it will heat up from your anger.
[06:42] Saad, what's the matter with you?
Mahi, pass me the nimco.
[06:49] Thank you.
[06:51] Don't take it the wrong way, I know Saad is your brother but...
[06:54] I'm forced to tell you this, it's your brother's responsibility to take care of his mother as well, not just yours.
[07:02] He's always at your in-laws.
My mother is not a burden on me.
[07:09] If brother wants to take care of her, good, if not then that is up to him.
[07:13] But I have to take care of my mother.
[07:15] Even if I object I do it for brother.
[07:19] It doesn't look nice to visit someone's home so often.
[07:24] You're right... the matter of the in-laws is very fragile.
[07:30] One might lose respect in an instance.
[07:33] Anyways, now that Zara's married, I don't think he'll visit often.
[07:38] Uncle Adnan, Zara was only an excuse, the real reason is Zaini.
[07:44] Do you know brother drops and picks her from college.
[07:46] She even calls him if she needs a pencil.
[07:49] So what's the matter? She's her fiance and it's her right.
[07:54] This will build their chemistry which would come useful in the future.
[08:00] Uh... but Saad's obedience towards Zara...
[08:05] It seems weird to me.
That's what I said to brother.
[08:09] It doesn't look good at all. Auntie Salma said the same thing.
[08:14] She said that being so close to one's sister-in-law isn't that good.
[08:18] I don't like someone talking like that about my brother,
[08:23] I don't know what she's done that he listens to her so much.
[08:29] Saad is completely like auntie Shaista. Even brother Adeel is like that.
[08:34] I don't know why they act like this?
[08:44] Uncle Adnan, you won't say this to anyone, right?
[08:50] Are you insane? Why would I do that?
[08:58] I'm not used to doing things like this.
[09:00] We've never talked together so much.
[09:06] Mother says that people who talk about others, will talk about you as well.
[09:12] No, it's not like that...
[09:14] I saw how badly Maheen treated you at the wedding.
[09:18] That's why I sat down to have a chat with you.
[09:21] Was she saying something?
[09:23] She doesn't like speaking to me, and I don't like talking to her.
[09:29] This is what happened to the person who speaks the truth today.
[09:51] I'm satisfied seeing Sarah here.
[09:55] Just pray for all the girls in the world.
[10:04] Adeel has turned out to be better than we expected.
[10:10] Sister Fareeda is happy as well.
I think...
[10:16] that we should prepare to leave.
[10:20] That's what I've been saying for a while.
[10:24] Let's stay for a while.
[10:28] Why?
[10:31] There will be no reception.
[10:35] There is no reason for us to stay.
[10:42] This is your daughter's in-laws. It won't look nice if we stay too long.
[11:08] I thought you guys would stay here for a few days, but you guys are leaving.
[11:15] You should have at least stayed until we did the rice pudding ceremony.
[11:21] Auntie, that will take a lot of days.
[11:23] Zara doesn't know how to make rice pudding.
[11:26] Don't worry, Adeel will make the rice pudding in Zara's place.
[11:36] Zara my dear.
[11:38] Here you go. Keep this. You and Adeel can buy whatever you want.
[11:47] Actually, Adeel and brother were of the opinion of giving no dowry.
[11:55] That's why I decided that kids would buy something of their choice.
[11:58] Brother, what are you doing?
[12:01] You should return this check. There is no need for this.
[12:07] My God... twenty five lacs... no...
[12:12] What will they do with such a hefty amount.
[12:17] First they'll go on a honeymoon.
[12:19] Then after they can do whatever they want.
[12:21] That's a hefty amount, it would have been better to just give dowry then.
[12:28] I mean that way people could have seen that the girl received a large dowry from her parents.
[12:36] The thing is that we don't like showing off.
[12:39] This is a father's gift to her daughter.
[12:44] What's the need for showing off?
[12:46] Didn't you hear what Maheen just said?
[12:49] This is a father's gift for her daughter, return the check.
[12:53] You have no right over this.
Sure, of course.
[13:01] Keep this Zara, this is a gift from your father. Who are we to say anything?
[13:12] Alright then, allow me to leave
[13:15] Uncle it's a large amount, it doesn't look nice.
[13:20] It's not greater than my daughter's happiness.
[13:25] Alright then farewell. Come my dear
Farewell.
[13:32] Sarwat, thank you so much.
[13:37] Visit us often... your daughter is now here.
[13:40] I will, you should visit us as well.
[13:53] Did you see? I told you that you are nothing in front of Sarwat.
[14:01] But you don't understand when I tell you something.
[14:04] She said that a lack of dowry would make her insecure.
[14:13] It was a check of twenty five lacs, but what did we gain?
[14:20] At lease we would have some stuff.
[14:21] What would have that changed? Don't you know the girls nowadays?
[14:26] They don't take out a single glass from their dowry.
[14:31] You don't understand how they've played us.
[14:37] Your father gifted them the house.
[14:41] And they've given them the money to spend on that house.
[14:45] To take my son and move out.
[14:48] They're planning against me, but you don't understand.
[14:52] You don't understand, all of this trouble is caused because you say too much.
[14:57] Do you know why Zara is getting all of this?
Because she keeps her mouth closed.
[15:03] This is her gift for remaining silent. What do you do?
[15:08] You keep on speaking. This is why you have to deal with all this.
[15:13] Listen to me... every time when you're made a fool out of...
[15:18] I am the one who has to suffer the consequences.
[15:21] My name is the one that is ruined.
[15:23] I can't stand to see it. I cannot do all of this. My son is being stolen from me.
[15:33] The thing is that I am not one to have hidden motives like Sarwat.
[15:41] I am like this. I am like that in front of everyone.
[15:46] Mother, for God's sake control your tongue.
[15:52] Do you know, you didn't choose Zara and because of that...
[15:58] she won't leave this house when you want her to, do you understand?
[16:03] No... I don't understand. My head will explode.
[16:08] For God's sake, make me tea.
[16:11] I'll make you that tea, but after that you will rest.
[16:21] I'm losing my son and she wants me to rest
[16:40] Here you are. I've brought all of the stuff.
[16:44] Cook dinner, your brother is coming back.
[16:47] What? Brother Manzoor is coming back?
[16:52] Who told you this?
[16:55] No anyone from here, but someone from over there. There was a call...
[16:59] Are Zara and Adeel coming as well?
[17:03] I don't know and I didn't ask.
[17:06] Meaning, there will be no reception.
[17:13] Listen, did something happen there.
Listen to me..
[17:18] I've stopped involving myself in the matters of women, that was what you wanted, right?
[17:24] When your brother comes back, you can ask him?
[17:28] Prepare dinner for brother.
[17:35] I'm sure something happened there. Why are they coming back?
[17:53] Adeel... keep this.
[18:04] Why should I keep this?
[18:08] What will I do with so much money?
Keep them, they will come in handy to you.
[18:13] Do you know what Saad said?
We'll go to our honeymoon using this.
[18:18] Saad says a lot of things. Do you take what he says seriously.
[18:24] Things that I may gain from I need to take seriously.
[18:28] Do you want to go?
Of course, especially if you decide to take me.
[18:33] Me? What do you mean?
Yes.
[18:36] If you can give your husband a wedding gift, then
[18:40] I'm sure you can take me on a honeymoon as well.
[18:42] What's so wrong with that?
You do say a lot of foolish things.
[18:47] Have this deposited in your account. I don't want it.
[18:51] Zara, this is your money, keep it with you.
[18:58] What will I do with this?
[19:01] You can open a small clinic with this. Keep it.
[19:06] Really... then you want to do business.
[19:10] Tell me then, how much interest will you take?
[19:15] A hundred percent.
That's more like a wife... give it to me.
[19:21] Give me your account number, I'll have this deposited.
[19:24] Adeel, I gave you this check.
[19:27] Alright fine, now it's up to me if I want to deposit in my account...
[19:33] or yours.
You are very stubborn.
[19:35] True.
[19:42] Zaini...
[19:45] Zaini.
Yes, what's the matter? Where are you going?
[19:47] I'm going home, do you want something?
[19:50] No, I don't. But leave after dinner.
[19:53] Auntie Shaista made dinner for us.
No I'm stuffed.
[19:59] Zara's mother-in-law took revenge from me by feeding me.
[20:03] I'm sure she must not like you bring so informal.
[20:06] When has she ever liked me?
[20:08] What I'm surprised at is how different Adeel is.
[20:12] Mahi is like her mother.
[20:13] Yes, every one has their nature. Mirha lives in the same house as well.
[20:19] But she is just like brother Adeel.
[20:22] That reminds me... give me my share.
[20:26] What share? What are you speaking about?
[20:29] What do you mean, what share?
[20:31] Have you forgotten? Adeel said you and I had a share in the money.
[20:36] Oh that...
[20:40] I have a right over your share as well.
Oh really..
[20:44] When it comes to you gaining something, you're reminding me of your right.
[20:50] Tell me, will you go to the university tomorrow?
[20:55] I'll have to... I've taken a lot of days off. Be on time tomorrow.
[21:01] Give me share first, then I'll come.
[21:04] I will not give you your share. Come if you want to, otherwise don't.
[21:10] I will not come.
You will not come?
[21:13] No.
[21:14] Alright. I'll go by myself.
[21:24] I'll come to pick you up. Call and wake me up.
[21:28] I will call you, but that would do anything if you pick up. I go insane calling you in the morning.
[21:34] I'll think about it...
For now I'm leaving, I'll think about it.
[21:39] Alright fine... Be sure to be on time in the morning.
I will. Farewell*
[21:46] She was saying the same over there as well.
[21:50] She wanted me to see Zara's face. I saw her face before I married her.
[21:56] We didn't force her. We married as per her choice. Then what's the matter with her?
[22:00] Enough sister, why are you being angry?
[22:08] Zara is very happy in her home, right?
Thank God she is.
[22:16] Thank God!
[22:18] It's better if daughters stay happy at their home.
[22:22] More than Zara her in-laws are happy.
[22:25] Because they have a girl who doesn't say anything.
[22:30] My dear, what does that mean?
[22:32] I didn't say anything complicated.
[22:36] I'm sure you must have understood. Didn't you?
[22:39] Have you gone insane? You always suspect people.
[22:44] People are affectionate sometimes just for show and you believed them.
[22:51] Tell me something, who do you want things to go bad for?
[22:55] What's with you Maheen?
[22:58] Tell me if Zara said something to you. Her parents are still alive.
[23:04] She was saying the same over there as well.
[23:08] She wanted me to see Zara's face. I saw her face before I married her.
[23:14] We didn't force her. We married as per her choice. Then what's the matter with her?
[23:18] Enough sister, why are you being angry.
[23:22] She's her sister and she is worried.
Then make her understand.
[23:27] Make her understand that one's in-laws are supposed to be treated like in-laws.
[23:31] She should think of them as in-laws, not her father's home.
[23:33] Then why do they act like they are my parents?
[23:38] Zara is no happy and I've told her that she should tell us when she's had enough.
[23:44] She's only putting on an act.
[23:48] I'll slap her on the face any day now.
[23:52] You know how she is.
She left her home...
[23:56] Calm down. Don't raise your blood pressure.
[24:00] You know how she is. Leave her.
[24:05] She won't even allow her sister to be happy.
[24:18] You were right.
[24:22] I've made a grave mistake.
[24:29] I've made the wrong decision.
[24:43] Here you are.
[24:49] What's the matter with you?
[24:52] Nothing, turn off the lights. I want to rest a while.
[24:58] Did mother say something to you? Tell me what happened.
[25:02] Zaini, don't you think... sit down.
[25:09] Don't you think Zara was lying. She was worried, not happy.
[25:16] Yes, I felt that too.. but she's the one who told us that...
[25:22] she misses us, and that's why she was worried.
No...
[25:27] She was lying. Didn't you see how Mahi was targeting her over everything.
[25:34] Look, it can just be a bad feeling.
[25:37] It can be that sister Mahi felt bad about her behavior.
[25:40] That's why she wants to live in harmony with Zara.
[25:44] You guys can think like this not me.
[25:46] I'm well aware of Mahi. She doesn't do anything without a motive.
[25:51] Go away now. I have a headache, I'll rest now.
[25:56] I want to sleep for a while. Turn off the lights, please.
[26:27] You need to make Maheen understand.
[26:31] She's getting more ill-mannered with every passing day.
[26:37] What did she say now?
She's going on about Zara.
[26:42] Every time she speaks she has something bad to say.
[26:46] Someone tell her who Zara's mother, is it her or me?
[26:50] She's her elder sister, I'm sure she means well.
[26:55] Listen to me... talk to her husband and send her back to her in-laws.
[27:00] She should go there and bother them. I've had enough of her!
[27:07] I was afraid that she might say something at Fareeda's...
[27:14] Don't worry. I'll talk to her.
[27:16] Sure, make her understand. Otherwise Zara will have to suffer because of her.
[27:20] God forbid... 
[27:24] sometimes you say strange things well.
[28:25] This color looks very nice on you.
[28:28] This is your favorite color.
[28:33] Yes it is... but...
[28:37] But ever since you've started wearing it, I've grown even more fond of it.
[28:43] When do we have to leave?
[28:45] We'll leave once you are ready.
[28:47] I'm ready... ask auntie if she will come along.
[28:52] I did ask her... she's going out with Mahi, so she can't join us.
[28:59] With Mahi... alright.
[29:21] Did someone say something to you?
[29:31] Everyone's nice here. They take care of me.
[29:41] Adeel, all of my happiness lies with you.
[29:49] You're like my shadow...
[29:55] Without your presence...
[29:59] all of my happiness is incomplete.
[30:12] Thank you so much.
[30:19] Now if you're ready, shall we leave.
[30:24] Let's go.
[31:28] Greetings* How are you all?
We're good!
[31:35] We've brought some gifts for you.
[32:31] I came here to meet you. 
[32:35] You said that you would talk to me once I get back from Karachi.
[32:39] There is nothing to gain from it.
Still, what is it?
[32:44] Why did you say this to me then?
[32:46] I told you that there is nothing to gain from it.
[32:55] Look Dolly, I'll leave tomorrow.
[32:59] We'll only talk on the phone. It's better that you talk to me face to face.
[33:11] I don't think your family likes me.
[33:14] Are you talking about sister Maheen?
[33:17] Yes, I'm talking about her.
[33:19] Why are you saying that?
[33:21] Didn't  you see how she treated me throughout the wedding?
[33:25] She passes sarcastic taunts at me. We're about to get married...
[33:34] No one said anything like I didn't exist.
[33:39] This is no way to treat me.
[33:45] Alright I'll talk to sister Maheen.
[33:48] What will you talk to her about?
[33:49]  Will you tell her that I complained about her?
[33:53] So that she makes my life more hell. There is nothing to gain from talking to her.
[33:58] When you don't want me to talk to her, then why are you telling me this?
[34:04] I'm saying this to you because if you can't have me respected in your home then...
[34:12] So...
[34:14] Then you should decide.
[34:21] Ali...
[34:23] I love you...
[34:26]  I want to marry you, but not at the cost of my respect.
[34:31] It's your problem how you make sister Mahi understand that. But if...
[34:37] any one of your family treats me like this...
[34:44] then you know my decision.
[35:06] So many days have passed since our marriage and they flew by.
[35:10] You're right... I'll join the hospital from tomorrow.
[35:21] When will we visit father?
[35:25] Whenever you want.
[35:27] But you're joining the hospital from tomorrow.
[35:30] That is for something important, otherwise I still have my vacations.
[35:34] You still have your vacations? That's great!
[35:38] But let me tell you something. We're not going to Karachi.
[35:42] You've spend so much time there, spend some time with me.
[35:49] Alright, we can go there later.
[35:55] If you want we can go by the end of this month.
[36:00] Alright?
[36:05] When we come back from Malaysia we can go to Karachi.
[36:11] Malaysia?
Yes
[36:15] Do you not want to go to our honeymoon?
Ali!
[36:19] I mean we will go there... spend time and enjoy ourselves.
[36:25] We're going to Malaysia!
[36:26] yes
[36:27]  When did you decide this?
[36:29] It was surprise, but I'm telling you now.
[36:32] Does auntie know?
[36:36] Don't even tell her...
[37:28] Look at what your daughter-in-law did!
[37:32] What is this?
It's an amulet
[37:41] I told you that she has entrapped Adeel by bewitching him with magic.
[37:45] Her mother came here, she must have given this to her!
[37:49] I'm telling you that she did this! She gave this to her!
[37:55] Listen to me...
Forget that and tell me where did you find this?
[38:01] Did you get it near Adeel's pillow? I'm sure she kept it there.
[38:08] For God's sake listen to me!
[38:12] You start screaming for no reason. I didn't get it from a pillow.
Then?
[38:18] I've had this for a week.
[38:20]  I found it at the day of the wedding on Adeel's dressing table.
[38:26] Why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide it?
I didn't tell you on purpose.
[38:34] I knew that you would create a scene for every one to see.
[38:39] Zara's family was here and you would have created a scene in front of them.
[38:44] That is what you do.
[38:46] Should I remain silent seeing something like this?
[38:51] That can't be... she can ruin my home with magic...
[38:58] and I should remain silent.
[39:01] Silence yourself. I don't like this habit of yours.
[39:04] You don't listen to anyone, especially me!
[39:09] Silent! Listen to me!
Silence yourself and listen to me.
[39:14] You will not create a scene. 
[39:17] Show this to someone and find out what it was being used for.
[39:23] We should know what it was used for, what if it's nothing major.
[39:27] How can it not be something major?
[39:30] You might suspect them but I know.
[39:34] You don't know Sarwat. Ask me! I know her very well
[39:41] She's her daughter, I'm sure she's worse than her!
[39:46] Even if it's a glass of water, one must drink it carefully, even if one filled it themselves.
[39:53] Be cautious. Your friend auntie Bushra goes to a cleric.
[40:00] Go with her and find out what this was being used for. 
[40:04] I don't want you be the bad guy in front of Adeel.
[40:08] Do you understand?
Enough, don't tell me. I know what to do.
[40:13] Don't do anything without evidence!
[40:21] I'm asking you to be silent. I understand everything.
[40:24] You can't remain silent!
[40:27] Don't say anything.
[40:30] Silence yourself. I'm worried and you're giving me advice.
[40:34] What will you worrying do? 
[40:35] Call auntie Bushra.
Bring me my phone.
