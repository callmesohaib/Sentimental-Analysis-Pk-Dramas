[00:17] What happened between you two? Both of you are worried.
[00:20] No mother, it's nothing like that. Don't know why you feel this way
[00:23] Everything is normal between us.
It's not just me, Dolly thinks the same.
[00:28] Whose message is it?
Why are you asking?
[00:31] Stay here.
[00:41] Why don't you tell me what Zara said?
[00:44] She said that she thought that were were honorable people.
[00:47] And that whatever that her mother and Maheen said was correct. That was the reason for your divorce.
[00:54] Stop this nonsense. Zara cannot say this.
[00:57] She didn't say this, I'm sure you're making it up.
[00:59] Don't believe me if you don't want to.
[01:02] Why were you asking me when you didn't want to believe me?
[01:16] Saad, why are we here?
[01:20] To buy something for my fiance. Can you help me?
[01:24] We're already late, let's go home.
[01:27] The thing is, she's upset with me. I forgot to wish her.
[01:32] I want to buy her a gift to cheer her up. I have no idea how to shop for girls.
[01:38] I had a friend who used to help me in stuff like this before, but could you help me now?
[01:46] Will you help me?
No.
[01:50] Zaini... Zaini.
[01:59] Here are your clothes.
Mother....
[02:01] When will these people leave?
Why?
[02:06] What problem do you have with them?
[02:09] I do have a problem. Tell them that the worst is over and they should return home.
[02:16] Why should I tell them that? Why shouldn't I say this to you?
[02:20] Tell me my dear, when are you returning to your in-laws?
[02:25] Mother, tell me one thing honestly...
[02:29] You are my mother, right?
[02:33] And I'm your daughter, right?
[02:38] To tell you the truth, that is the question that arises in my heart about you
[02:44] You will regret it when she runs away with Ali from beneath your nose.
[02:52] You and your suspicions! For God's sake...
[02:59] enough of this. Do you know what your problem is?
[03:05] You always think negatively about everything.
[03:09] Mother, I heard everything. She's manipulating Ali.
[03:14] And Ali agreed to her.
Yes.
[03:18] Everyone uses their ears to listen. So what if Ali agreed?
[03:24] That's what I'm saying, we've been asking him to do the same.
[03:27] He didn't listen to you, me or father.
[03:31] But he listened to Dolly, do you understand what that means.
[03:36] That means that husband and wife should listen to each other.
[03:41] Every husband and wife should listen to each other, you should agree to it as well.
[03:47] Usama called your father, they will be here to take you away.
[03:55] Alright!
[04:04] My God... who is she like? Even my mother-in-law didn't bother me as much as she does.
[04:19] It's been two days since they returned to Karachi. You didn't even call them.
[04:26] Why don't you come with me to their home? I won't like nice going to their home.
[04:34] Tell me one thing. I don't know what's in your mind.
[04:38] But on your say so we went to your in-laws wedding. What happened to us there?
[04:44] Your wife didn't even come to us. She greeted us and then disappeared.
[04:49] That is the least they could have done for us.
[04:54] But what did your in-laws do... they disrespected us.
[04:58] She was angry mother, she was upset, as were you guys.
[05:04] Really? She was upset and that's why she didn't come to us.
[05:07] We are upset as well and will not go to their home to offer our condolences.
[05:11] If you want to go then go, I will not stop you. But I won't go to a place where I'm not respected.
[05:19] I called uncle and told them that we will be visiting them in the evening.
[05:23] Who did you ask before making this promise. Who agreed to go with you?
[05:28] Look son... we gave up in front of you and made a mistake.
[05:33] We married you to Maheen.
[05:35] We will regret this mistake for as long as we have to.
[05:38] We can't do anything more than that.
[05:39] But we won't visit your in-laws, because we have no respect there.
[05:47] But mother...
No buts..
[05:50] Look, I have much to do. I have to cook lunch.
[05:53] You'll only eat if I cook it. Your wife isn't here to cook it for you.
[06:02] Don't anger me... if you want to go then go... but I won't.
[06:24] Sister, did you talk again?
[06:27] With whom?
Mahi.
[06:36] Will you tell me something if I ask you something?
[06:54] What do I seem to you? What do you think of me?
[06:59] You're my sister-in-law, cousin and friend.
[07:04] And who are friends?
[07:06] People who know everything about you.
[07:11] People who keep your secrets.
[07:15] If I ask you something will you tell me the truth?
[07:22] What do you mean? What do you want to ask me?
[07:29] Who came to meet you?
[07:36] Who are you speaking of? Who came to meet me?
[07:41] When Mahi asked you... when the gate was open and he ran away.
[08:00] Sister... promise me that you won't tell anyone.
[08:05] I won't tell anyone anything.
First promise.
[08:09] Mirha, I won't say anything to anyone.
[08:19] It was a guy names Aqib, he came to meet me.
[08:26] I like him.
[09:07] Zaini... Zaini.
[09:11] What was it that I said now?
[09:16] You miss Zara very much, right?
No.
[09:21] Lies!
[09:23] I'm answering you. I should know if it's the truth or a lie.
[09:28] How can you decide that?
Really?
[09:31] Can't I really feel it?
[09:35] Feel what?
[09:36] Saad do you love me, or did you engage me because of Zara.
[09:41] Why is Zara coming between us so much lately.
[09:43] She's always been!
[09:45] Saad, has been between us for as long as I remember.
[09:48] She wanted us to get engaged, that's why you said yes.
[09:54] Zara was the one who held us together, now that she's gone...
[09:59] we are drawing apart.
What nonsense are you saying?
[10:04] I wanted to ask this of you...
[10:07] what are you doing Saad? What do you want?
[10:23] Brother Ahmed, I apologize.
[10:27] I couldn't make it on time. Actually we weren't here.
[10:35] Brother, things carry on.
[10:40] You don't need to apologize.
[10:45] We didn't even think that our only son would leave us like this.
[10:53] Have hope sister, this is what God wanted.
[10:59] All of us have to go.
[11:02] This is God's life and we have to return it to Him one day.
[11:08] Have patience. God loves those are patient.
[11:15] Fareeda... call Mahi.
[11:21] You know how Mahi is...
[11:25] She doesn't leave her room all day.
[11:28] She cries and misses her brother all day.
[11:32] She loved Adeel very much. Anyways I'll call her.
[11:48] Son, how goes your work?
[11:51] Thank God uncle, everything is fine.
[12:10] Mahi... Mahi... what are you doing here?
[12:15] Change and come downstairs. You know that brother Noor Alam is downstairs.
[12:20] They're here, when did they arrive?
[12:22] It's been a while since they arrived. Get ready and come downstairs.
[12:26] And where is Mirha? Ask her to make tea.
[12:29] You'll ask Mirha to make tea?
[12:31] She'll make it for the guests? She makes such tasteless tea.
[12:35] Who else will make it? Should I ask Zara?
So?
[12:41] Who else than her? Ask her to make it and I'll serve it to them.
[12:47] Alright... just get ready, and I'll ask Zara.
[12:52] And listen...
[12:54] the guy is here as well. If you get the chance to talk to him...
[12:59] be mindful of what you speak.
[13:02] For now let them do what they came here to do, these are things for later.
[13:06] What did I say? I said that if you get the chance to talk to him. You don't listen to me.
[13:15] Hurry up and get ready.
[13:22] Do you see that Mahi couldn't make tea for just two people.
[13:28] It's just tea... don't think so much about such little things.
[13:34] I'll help you out. Add everything, I'll take care of the rest.
[13:39] Alright, Mirha...
[13:44] Serve this as well.
[13:51] Shall I ask you something?
Sure.
[13:55] Does everyone know about this?
[14:01] Are you asking about Aqib?
Mahi... uncle...
[14:05] or auntie, do they know about this?
[14:09] No one knows... and nor do I want to tell anyone.
[14:12] I don't want to be scolded.
[14:14] It's nothing to be scolded about. I think you should tell them.
[14:21] If not today, then one day you'll have to tell them.
[14:23] This is not your home, they will no accept love marriage.
[14:27] Brother Saad and Zaini are getting married as well.
[14:31] Sister Mahi will go mad if she learns that I like someone.
[14:35] She got her way when she got married.
[14:37] It's not good to talk about your elder sister in that tone.
[14:43] Why are you bothering her? Let her work.
[14:48] How much more longer?
Five minutes.
[14:51] I'm sending Mahi to take the tea away
[14:54] Don't be the one to bring it.
I'm helping her as well.
[14:57] No you're not. You're just talking to her. Go to your room and rest.
[15:05] Do you see... I told you... all that everyone cares about here is to have their work done.
[15:10] When Mahi was suppose to take the tea, then she should have made it.
[15:14] Again with the same thing.
[15:16] We were having such a good conversation.
[15:18] Pass me the cups.
Sure.
[15:45] Why has Zaini become so insecure of Zara, who's her sister.
[15:58] Ever since we've returned from Zara's home she's been acting like this.
[16:02] How can my friendship with Zara affecting my relationship with Zaini?
[16:06] She has switched off her phone...
[16:08] how should I make her understand that it isn't like that?
[16:27] Saad, what did you decide?
[16:30] What do you mean? I should marry your sister?
[16:34] Do you want me to make me your brother-in-law?
yes
[16:36] are you mad?
What's so wrong with that?
[16:38] What's so wrong with my sister?
[16:40] The thing is that she's your sister and she's jealous of our friendship.
[16:44] Are you insane? Why would she be jealous of our friendship?
[16:49] She's the one who acts like it.
[16:52] Did you not see how she intrudes whenever we make a plan.
[16:56] And... she used to instigate fights between us ever since we were kids.
[17:01] And have you thought why she did that?
[17:04] Have you ever thought why she tried including herself into our plans?
[17:07] Maybe she feels that I should have been friends with her not you.
[17:11] Maheen is always alone. We two are together and she's alone.
[17:15] Maybe that's why.
[17:17] It could also be that she doesn't think about me and Maheen.
[17:21] She thinks about you.
About me?
[17:24] I'm talking about you three sister, where did I come from?
[17:28] Saad, I think she likes you
[17:31] She does, I'm telling you.
[18:31] I want to buy something for my fiance.
[18:34] She's upset with me, I forgot to wish her.
[18:39] I want to cheer her up and buy her a gift. I don't know how to shop for girls.
[18:45] I had a friend who I used to come with, but why don't you help me out today.
[18:59] Auntie told me that you stay upset nowadays.
[19:03] I can understand your pain, but try to keep yourself busy.
[19:09] I do try.
[19:13] You make good tea.
Thank you.
[19:18] You don't say much.
[19:22] Actually I don't like much talking.
[19:26] Ask something about me.
[19:30] What should I ask? Your family has told me everything about you.
[19:35] Still... if you want to know something about me.
[19:39] I believe that we should know each other well.
[19:44] In my family this happens between elders.
[19:47] My father will decide whatever he thinks is best.
[19:51] And you?
[19:53] What do you mean? Do you object something?
[20:00] We should go inside. It's been a while, and it doesn't seem nice.
[20:05] Come on...
After you.
[20:14] Zaini... we are in the same boat.
[20:20] If one of us drowns, then both of us will drown.
[20:26] I mean...
[20:28] if there is a problem between you and my brother relationship...
[20:34] then it will affect my relationship with Ali.
[20:39] So whatever you do think long and hard before you do so.
[20:54] What are you doing?
[20:56] Making tea uncle Adnan. Would you like some?
[20:58] Sure, make one cup for me too.
[21:03] Did you note something? Is there something going on between Saad and Zaini?
[21:08] No... it's nothing like that.
[21:11] Yes, how would you know? You take care of the entire house.
[21:16] You don't have much time to note anything.
[21:19] How do you know if there's something like that?
[21:21] I can tell by looking at someones face about what's going on their head and heart.
[21:26] Even if it is like that, they are adults... and they will fix it themselves.
[21:32] Thank you.
[21:35] I'm worried about you?
Why is that?
[21:38] I speak the truth, whether someone likes it or not.
[21:43] What do you mean?
[21:45] If Saad and Zaini's life is affected...
[21:48] then your life will be affected to.
Why is that?
[21:52] You and Ali and connected to them. This is what happens in such arranged marriages.
[21:57] Let me explain. If Saad says something to Zaini and she complains it to her brother Ali..
[22:05] then whose life will be affected? It will be you Dolly.
[22:10] Do you understand it or no?
[22:14] Alright then... shall I take a biscuit? Which one is the best?
[22:17] this one..
Thank you.
[22:43] When he asked you if you had any objections, that means that he doesn't have any objections, right?
[22:51] Your living in a dream world again mother. Don't say such things.
[22:55] Only he knows what is in his heart.
[22:58] We can only know when he says what's in his heart.
[23:02] It's nothing like that. One can make an educated guess and mine is right...
[23:10] I think you'll get married to him... that's what brother Noor Alma implied as well.
[23:15] Did he say something else?
[23:17] He said nothing.
[23:20] He wanted to hear something from me. He was constantly prying at me.
[23:26] He kept asking me if I wanted to ask something of him.
[23:29] I wanted to ask him how come he was so stupid.
[23:32] Do you think I'll start telling him everything if he just asks me? Is it that easy?
[23:40] I'm your mother and even I couldn't understand you, then how could that poor guy?
[23:48] You should have answered this question then. Forget it then.
[23:57] My slipper got stuck.
[24:02] She will always stay stupid. She will never answer a question in a straight manner.
[24:22] Hello.
Hello, is this Saad speaking?
[24:26] Yes what is it?
[24:27] I'm Junaid speaking from Zaviar private limited. 
[24:30] Did you drop your CV at our company?
[24:33] Yes I did.
You have an interview at eleven in the morning.
[24:37] Sure I'll be there.
[24:39] Farewell.
[24:44] I'll tell Zaini.
[24:57] I'll call Zara.
[25:07] Zara doesn't pick up, we can at least talk on the phone
[25:19] Saad...
[25:21] Why don't you pick up? I called you earlier as well.
[25:26] You could at least talk to me.
[25:28] Is everything alright at home. Are mother and father okay?
[25:33] Everyone is fine, but Zaini has lost her mind.
[25:39] Do you know what she said to me?
[25:42] What happened now?
[25:44] She said what she normally says. That I don't love her the way I used to
[25:49] I admit that I made a mistake, but this punishment doesn't justify it.
[25:52] I'll talk to her.
[25:55] How much more will I try to cheer her up?
[25:59] Who are you talking to Zara?
[26:02] It's Saad. Do you have something for me?
[26:05] No, talk to him. I'll talk to you later.
[26:09] I'll come to you when I'm finished talking to him.
[26:15] Yes Saad?
Who was that?
[26:18] It was Mahi.
[26:20] What were you saying?
[26:23] I wanted to give you some good news.
Really?
[26:36] I believe that we should get to know each other first.
[26:41] These things are settled by our elder. Father will do what he thinks is right
[27:12] Zaini...
[27:15] What are you thinking about?
[27:18] Nothing, I was just studying.
[27:21] You were so focused that you didn't even see me enter.
[27:26] What's the matter?
[27:29] I was just studying.
[27:33] Zaini I know you well. What are you worried about?
[27:41] It's nothing, my exams are about to start and I was worried about that.
[27:50] Do you remember how worried we used to get for our exams at school?
[27:57] Yes... still you used to get better marks than me.
[28:03] That is because Zara used to help me and brother used to help you.
[28:09] Yes.
[28:13] Why did you get so quiet?
[28:18] It's nothing... I remembered by childhood.
[28:26] Shall I say something to you?
[28:28] Sure what is it?
[28:32] I'm your friend and your sister-in-law, but I'm your friend first.
[28:41] Zaini, we two are on the same boat.
[28:46] If one of us drowns the other one will also drown with them.
[28:53] I mean...
[28:55] If there is a problem between you and my brother, then it will affect my relationship with Ali.
[29:06] Whatever you do think long and hard before doing it.
[29:17] Continue studying, I'll leave.
[29:47] Mirha is such a fool.
[29:49] I mean what is there to mind if your family gets to know
[29:54]  Families nowadays are relieved that girls are able to find suitors for themselves.
[29:58] To save themselves from the hassle. What did you say to convince your family?
[30:05] Where did I come from? 
[30:08] What's so bad if I can learn something from it?
[30:11] When one hears an example...
[30:16] one is to able to understand things better. So what did you say?
[30:22] Do one thing, don't talk about yourself. I'll tell you what I said. 
[30:26] Tell her that my family said nothing to me, neither was I scared.
[30:29] Mahi you asked me find out and let you know about Mirha. That's why I told you.
[30:34] It would be better if you talk to her yourself now.
[30:37] You really are upset.
[30:42] If I talked about you, I talked about myself as well. I didn't taunt you.
[30:49] Think about it yourself... what would happen if Mirha happens the wrong person. 
[30:54] Who will be responsible if she sets on the wrong path?
[30:57] You will, right?
Why would it be my responsibility?
[31:03] Zara you are so naive. You know how close Mirha is to you.
[31:08] She shares everything with you, so tell me whose responsibility is she?
[31:13] What I can ask Mirha to do is introduce that man to you?
[31:19] Why can't you understand one simple thing.
[31:22] Mirha is close to you, she doesn't even talk to me.
[31:28] If you ask her, maybe she'll introduce you to him. She won't introduce him to me.
[31:35] I was thinking, why don't you meet that guy?
[31:41] Will you?
[31:44] Me?
[31:47] You.
[32:13] You're here alone.
Yes.
[32:18] After what you did to mother at Zara's wedding...
[32:23] What did I do? Are you here to avenge your mother?
[32:28] Mahi, I didn't come here to avenge anyone. I came to take you back.
[32:33] Alone?
[32:35] Yes.... alone.
[32:38] Do you think I should go to a home where people don't respect me?
[32:43] My brother-in-law died and no one came here to offer my condolences 
[32:47] and you want me to return to that house?
[32:51] The man you are talking about, I came to that man's wedding. Maybe you are forgetting that I was the one who convinced everyone to come.
[32:58] What did you do? You disrespected them.
[33:04] What can I do if they do not want to come now?
[33:06] What is my fault in this? 
[33:08] Neither you or they are understanding my situation.
[33:11] I am trapped. 
[33:13] Do you know why I was unable to come here for so many days?
[33:16] Because I was trying to convince mother to come with me, but she didn't!
[33:21] Is she that hardhearted?
[33:23] Enough Maheen
[33:26] I'm tried of all this... tell me what you want. 
[33:30] Are you coming with me, or should I return?
[33:33] Brother why would you go? Please sit down, I'll bring you some tea.
[33:40] Can't you see we are talking? Go away.
[33:43] I'll tell uncle and auntie that you're here. Don't go anywhere.
[34:13] Dolly, who are you to talk between me and my husband. 
[34:17] Why don't you mind your business?
[34:20] Sister, this is not just between you and your husband.
[34:25] This is a matter that concerns the entire house. He was about to leave.
[34:27] Why do you care? Stay within your limits.
[34:33] Sister I've seen uncle and auntie worried about this home and you.
[34:39] What was so bad in what I said? This is my home as well.
[34:43] Your home?
[34:45] Is this your home? I'm giving you two minutes. Take your mother away from here.
[34:52] And... your dreams of ruling over this house...
[34:57] They will never come true.
[35:01] What kind of tone are you talking with me?
[35:03] If it's like that, then this is not your home and you should leave.
[35:06] What tone are you talking with me?
[35:08] Take your mother and leave!
[35:12] Before speaking think about your worth.
[35:17] What is your problem with me?
[35:19] Why do you hate me so much? You're always against me.
[35:23] If that's the case, then go ahead and tell your mother.
[35:26] I can see right through...
[35:29] your innocent act. I know why you're staying here.
[35:36] I don't care, think whatever you want. 
[35:39] The only reason I want to stay here is to take care of auntie and uncle.
[35:44] Auntie asked me to stay here and take care of her.
[35:47] Are my parents now your parents?
[35:52] With what right are you saying all this?
[35:56] Huh?
They are my in-laws.
[36:00] They are not your in-laws yet.
[36:03] Not will it whilst I'm alive.
[36:07] What?
[36:09] What do you mean by that? Why do you hate me so much?
[36:13] No need to talk back!
[36:15] Why? I will speak!
[36:18] I think the reason you're like this is because no one said anything to you.
[36:21]  If they had then we wouldn't have to such days.
[36:24] I'll go and tell your parents about what you said. We'll have a decision today.
[36:29] How dare you!
[36:35] You shouldn't have done that.
[36:59] Ali... Ali...
What is it?
[37:05] What is it? Why are you crying?
[37:11] Take me home, I can't stay here.
[37:13] Tell me what happened.
[37:19] Sister Maheen tried to slap me.
[37:22] Why did she do that?
Ask her.
[37:27] I was giving her husband respect,
[37:29]  I was trying to make him stay and this is how she treated me.
[37:33] She was insulting brother Usama. I was just trying to stop him.
[37:40] What is my fault in this?
Brother Usama is here as well?
[37:46] I just asked her to go with him, since he was here for her.
[37:52] I said it because of this family.
[37:56] Tell me... did I say something wrong? Did I make a mistake.
[38:04] Everyone knows that sister Maheen did all this.
[38:08] It's all her fault.
[38:14] I have always given you all love and respect.
[38:19] She tried to raise her hands on me.
[38:24] It's a big thing to raise your hand on someone.
[38:28] I'm only silent because of your honor. I didn't tell anyone about this.
[38:36] Only for you.
[38:39] If I wanted to I could have created a scene.
[38:51] I don't want to stay here. Take me back home, I can't stay here.
[38:57] I'll tell mother. Take me home. After I leave...
[39:03] if you want to, ask sister Maheen why she did this to me.
[39:09] And if you don't want to, then don't ask because it doesn't make a difference to me.
[39:13] Sit down here... please...
[39:20] Dolly, drink this water.
[39:24] Dolly please... drink water... just one sip.
[39:34] Please stop crying.
[39:38] Dolly.
[39:40] Stop crying.
[39:42] Look here.
[39:45] Look... I know you didn't tell anyone at home and came straight to me.
[39:53] Believe me that I'm lucky to have you in my life.
[40:01] I will never leave your side.
[40:06] I will stand by you every step of the way.
[40:10] I promise.
[40:14] Please... keep this to yourself. I promise that I will handle all of this.
[40:24] Alright.
[40:27] Dolly
[40:34] Drink water and relax.
