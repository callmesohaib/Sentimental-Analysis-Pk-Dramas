[00:12] dear, this is not the matter of only one day. Its a lifetime's issue
[00:17] if not today, then tomorrow you have to face them
[00:22]  mom, we'll look at the future later
[00:26] right now I don't have the courage 
[00:43] my son was so proud of Zara 
[00:47] but not even a year had passed of his demise & Zara got married
[00:52] Enough be quiet! Don't lie..
[00:58] your hatred ate away all the happiness of this family
[01:13] hey Shaista
[01:15] yes
[01:16] you wore it, right?
from where did you get it?
[01:19] its very nice, everyone had praised it a lot at the wedding
[01:23] show me
[01:31] its very heavy though
[01:34] yes, its of real gold. My granny had gifted this to my mom on her wedding
[01:39] and then my mom had gifted it to me, then I had kept it safely
[01:43] but you never told me. Where did you kept it secretly?
[01:47] why will I hide it from you? What are you saying?
[01:51] Adnan, actually it my heartiest desire to gift it to my child the way my mother had gifted me
[01:59] but maybe God had planned something else
[02:01] there is nothing in a human's control
[02:04] today I thought of wearing it at the wedding, at least I should wear it myself
[02:09] no problem, it will suit you whenever you will wear it again
[02:13] my wife will look so beautiful after wearing it
[02:16] really?
yes
[02:19] and yes, keep it safely somewhere. What if you loose it, Ok?
[02:23] obviously I will keep it safely, after all its my granny's set
[02:28] Okay, I am leaving
[02:31] where are you going?
[02:35] I don't want to talk to you
[02:40] you already took complete revenge from Zara 
[02:45] for God sake leave her
[02:49] let her live her life
[02:53] why am I thinking about Zara? What's done is done
[02:57] don't know what is dad's problem, he keeps calling his sister again & again
[03:01] why he doesn't leave her on her own!
[03:05] my mood was so good, he ruined it
[03:08] he had completely ruined it
[03:28] are you looking for something?
[03:30] yes, my phone
[03:34] can I help you?
[03:38] No, thank you! I will find it
[03:40] try to give a bell, you will get to know where it is
[03:43] if I had the phone then why I would be looking for it?
[03:48] You didn't get me. I mean, try giving bell from my phone
[03:53] No, I have my sister. I will give the bell from her phone, thank you!
[04:02] your sister is busy with her friends
[04:05] why are you giving stress to your family for no reason
[04:09] its just that you've have to give a bell
[04:11] do it
[04:14] thanks!
[04:29] All praise to God you are looking so pretty
[04:39] who is calling on Mahi's phone?
[04:43] Mirha, check this & tell Mahi. Don't know who is calling
[04:58] its ringing but nobody is picking
[05:00] thanks!
[05:01] sister, your phone was with mom. You were getting a call from an unknown number
[05:06] give me, I was looking for it
[05:10] thank you!
[05:12] lets go
come
[05:48] hello! where is your focus?
[05:52] nowhere
[05:54] it seems that brother got a new drug
[05:57] shut up! You guys are thinking wrong, there isn't any such thing
[06:01] I am very well aware of your nature. What do you think, we don't know?
[06:06] that girl did a harassment case on you
[06:09] that's why you came back to Pakistan
[06:11] be quiet, somebody will hear us
[06:13] leave it Sami, why are you annoying him
[06:16] ok tell us, who is she?
[06:17] one middle class girl
[06:19] oh! so this time its the turn of a middle-class girl
[06:21] but these middle-class girls are such a cry baby. They cling to you like a glue
[06:28] don't you worry
[06:30] I don't do anything without planning
[06:33] Planning! It means, haven't you planned to settle down after marrying?
[06:36] Come on, I don't want her to stick to me after marrying
[06:40] just wait & watch, I will just do one phone call & she'll get attracted towards me
[06:46] how come?
[06:49] just see
[06:50] so whenever you are done with her, pass her number to me
[06:54] yes, for sure I will give you
[07:01] hello, who is it?
[07:02] didn't you recognize me?
[07:05] No, I didn't. With whom you want to speak to?
[07:08] with Mahi
[07:11] brother, who is this speaking?
[07:12] Fahad. Just now we met in the party
[07:17] oh Fahad! how come you've called me?
[07:21] Nothing! I just wanted to know about your well-being
[07:25] did you guys reach home?
[07:28] yes yes, your driver had dropped us. Thank you!
[07:32] oh, you've made me a stranger in just a moment by saying thanks
[07:37] what?
[07:38] I mean, I & Sehrish felt really good after meeting you guys
[07:42] nobody gives so much of importance to anyone in our class
[07:46] but I just asked your mother only once, & she had honored my words
[07:54] I felt really good
[07:56] even you had helped us a lot
[07:59] we would have got late for coming home if your driver hadn't dropped us
[08:04] thank you!
[08:05] my pleasure!
ok its quite late, you shall rest. I'll talk to you later, bye!
[08:11] Bye!
[09:53] Saad
[09:56] mom you!
[09:57] why are you sleeping on the sofa?
[10:00] mom, just like that..
[10:17] mom, there isn't any fault of Zara in it
[10:20] don't say anything to her, I had said to her that I will sleep on the sofa
[10:23] she was telling me not to
[10:25] I wasn't expecting this foolishness from both of you
[10:28] both of you are husband & wife
[10:31] God forbid if someone else would have seen it, then I had to hear so many things
[10:36] sorry mom, there isn't any such thing...
enough!
[10:39] I don't want to hear anything else
[10:41] this drama shall not happen in my house again, got it?
[10:46] Ok mom
[11:29] mom, what's wrong with you? What work you've got Mirha into?
[11:33] so what's the big deal in it?
[11:36] he is such a nice guy. Very handsome & rich
[11:41] he also came to drop us home last night
[11:45] oh God, I have been thinking the entire night that I shall get some information about his family
[11:51] I just want to know that whether he is engaged or not
[11:57] let me talk to your father & fix your proposal
[12:01] I've told you thousands of times, not to show so much of haste
[12:04] what's the matter of haste in it?
[12:07] your father will bring some ordinary proposal for you, will it be fine then?
[12:11] isn't it better that I shall do your engagement before that?
[12:13] I don't want to do any engagement or so, mom
[12:16] and what do you know about that guy?
[12:19] except for this, that he is Mirha's friend's cousin!
[12:22] and will you handover your daughter to someone just like that?
[12:25] why so? Why will I give my daughter to someone so easily?
[12:29] we will contact them, do the investigation & get fully satisfied
[12:34] I will talk to your father & fix your proposal then
[12:37] I don't want to marry
[12:42] listen!
[12:44] I can give you some time to think
[12:47] think about it but don't delay this matter much
[12:50] I have to get you married for sure
[12:53] she doesn't want to marry!
[13:13] serve your brother first, dear

[26:43] and you are such a boaster!
[26:46] ok sister, do whatever you feel like
[26:49] but don't say anything to me when you regret

[29:31] my daughter is so intelligent, that its evident for her to get the job
[29:36] now you have to do you work with complete work & honesty
[29:40] I & your father have quite a lot of hopes from you
[29:46] don't worry mom, I will never let you down
[29:52] come on dear, lets make tea. Manzoor must be coming, we'll drink it together
[29:55] So tell me what did they ask you?
[30:05] tea
[30:09] thank you!
[30:13] where is your tea?
[30:15] I have already drink
[30:18] by the way, I don't enjoy drinking the tea alone
[30:24] if we have good company with tea, then it doubles the taste of tea
[30:31] I will be careful next time
[30:35] do you agree so easily?
[30:38] means?
[30:41] I mean, you were not like this earlier
[30:45] you used to fight with me, you used to insist me
[30:49] you used to convince me
[30:54] and now you lose hope so easily
[30:57] you've changed a lot, Zara
[31:00] nothing is like before
[31:03] there is a lot of difference between old times & now, Saad
[31:06] what is the difference?
[31:08] even earlier we were friends
[31:16] by the way, tea is really good
[31:20] thank you!
[31:23] how is mom now?
[31:25] she is better, much better than earlier
[31:28] Dolly will come tomorrow...
[31:31] so you will get some rest
[31:35] did I miss something?
[31:37] No, I was just telling you
[31:40] Zara, you have done so much for this house. You gave many sacrifices
[31:47] they way you've handled this house after Dolly's marriage
[31:52] I couldn't have handled it myself
[31:56] even you gave so many sacrifices, Saad
[32:00] your journey wasn't easy as well
[32:03] it was difficult
[32:07] yes it was difficult
[32:11] but less than yours, Zara
[32:15] you've tolerated so much, you've been through a lot
[32:20] would you like to eat something?
[32:24] can we sit & talk for sometime
[32:36] where they have gone?
[32:39] they have gone to NADRA for some work
[32:42] they must be lying that they are going to NADRA
[32:44] they must have gone for an outing for sure
[32:46] dear, wherever they have gone
[32:49] why will we have an objection?
[32:53] mom, do you know sister Maheen came when I was about to leave for here
[33:00] when she got to know that I am coming here, she got very angry
[33:04] she was being so angry, she scolded me a lot
[33:08] but anyways, then mom also scolded her a lot
[33:13] but why Maheen had an objection on your visit here?
[33:18] she doesn't want us to keep any relation with this house
[33:21] Okay
[33:23] so that's why Ali didn't come inside
[33:25] No no, Ali was getting late for office that's why he left from outside
[33:30] hmm... 
[33:32] mom, its all because of Zara
[33:36] and you've become so normal with her, as if nothing has happened
[33:40] everyone takes very good care of your over there
[33:43] just now you were telling me that your mother-in-law took your side
[33:48] she scolded her daughter too
[33:50] and now you are bad-mouthing about her
[33:54] dear.. 
[33:57] all the wounds heal within time
[34:02] you'll see, one day everyone's behavior will become fine with you
[34:06] as far as Zara is concerned
[34:09] so she is such a nice girl
[34:11] she is not bad
[34:12] mom, are you saying this?
[34:14] it seems that she did some magic on you
[34:18] yes
[34:20] she did magic though
[34:24] because of her good behavior
[34:27] she has put the liveliness in this entire house
[34:33] earlier, I used to think that after your marriage
[34:38] who is going to handle this house
[34:42] but she took all the responsibilities as soon as she came in
[34:48] and do you know what?
[34:50] she takes very good care of me, she serves me a lot. Just like you
[34:55] mom, you've forgotten so quickly that how she is
[34:58] No dear, I've been observing since so many days
[35:02] as of yet, she haven't done any such thing that can be true as per what people say about her
[35:10] she is such a nice girl
[35:13] dear, my experience says that she is not characterless
[35:18] she is very nice
[35:20] my eyes can never see wrong
[35:26] it means you want to say that whichever allegations they have put on Zara are false?
[35:31] dear, a man can hide his sins but a woman...
a woman's sins are attached to her like her shadow
[35:38] which can be seen by everyone 
[35:41] this is the difference between a man & a woman
[35:43] a man cannot be caught even after committing a sin
[35:47] but a woman... a woman's sight also become her sin
[35:53] it seems from your words that you've forgiven her
[35:58] yes
[36:00] I have forgiven her
[36:02] she has won my heart
[36:05] by serving me
[36:08] by taking care of me
[36:10] and dear, you also win everyone's heart there. Try for it
[36:18] and... if Maheen have some objections with you
[36:22] then try to win her heart as well, dear
[36:26] you are the daughter-in-law of that house
[36:30] now its your duty, Ok?
[36:34] and my prayers are for all
[36:38] and I pray that Zaini also gets married into some good family
[36:44] so that the distances between both the families shall be removed
[36:47] Amen
[37:10] so what's the matter?
[37:13] why are you so angry?
[37:16] mom, do you have any idea that how I am living in that hell hole?
[37:23] what happened, will you tell me what happened?
[37:27] mom, my mother-in-law has started taunting me
[37:31] for what she is taunting you?
[37:33] for the baby
[37:35] she says, I can never become a mother
[37:39] oh God! who said this to her? Why are you saying such things?
[37:45] mom, I am not saying this. She is saying this!
[37:49] such a rubbish, why is she saying this? God will make everything better
[37:54] Mills of the God grinds slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine
[37:57] mom, I want to go to the doctor
[38:04] will you take me there?
[38:06] yes yes, I will take you to the doctor for sure
[38:08] in fact, I think I should talk to Usama first
[38:12] tell him as well
[38:14] mom, what are you saying? For now I cannot say anything to Usama
[38:20] ok fine, I will take you
[38:23] don't cry
[38:25] its a useless worry
[38:28] don't cry now
