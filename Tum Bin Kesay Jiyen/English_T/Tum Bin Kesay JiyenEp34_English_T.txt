[00:12] You don't want to marry because of Zara.
[00:14] Are you insane Zaini? Where has Zara come from?
[00:17] She has always been between us.
[00:22] And this truth will never change.
[00:24] You wanted to take revenge from me, right?
[00:27] Revenge? Why would I take revenge from you?
[00:32] What I'm thinking is right.
[00:34] You didn't get any happiness, that's why you can't tolerate mine.
[00:40] It's not like that. Life has become very weird.
[00:45] There is always some tension in life.
[00:47] What happened Saad? You seem really worried to me.
[00:53] I miss you very much.
[00:56] If only you were here, there would be no problem in life.
[01:32] Sister Mahi you look beautiful today.
[01:35] Thank you. Have I never looked beautiful before today?
[01:39] No, you have always been beautiful.
[01:44] Are you ready now?
Sadaf let's go outside.
[01:55] Don't worry about her, you know she's always emotional.
[01:59] Tell me how I look.
[02:02] You look very pretty.
[02:04] Show me your hand.
[02:25] Perfect.
What?
[02:29] But...
[02:34] What happened?
[02:42] What happened? Who was it?
[02:45] Uncle, how do I look?
[02:54] What happened? Why aren't you guy saying anything?
[02:58] He got a call and since then he isn't saying anything.
[03:04] Say something.
[03:16] Thank you brother for taking us out for a lovely dinner.
[03:19] What's there to thank for?
[03:24] I don't think Maheen liked it.
[03:27] I don't think she liked us coming with you two.
[03:30] No mother, it's not like that at all.
[03:34] Right Maheen?
Usama is right... there's nothing like this.
[03:40] Really... then why aren't you having your soup, it's completely cold.
[03:46] If you don't like it, order something else.
[03:49] I am drinking it, I like to have it cold.
[03:55] Enough, how many pictures will you guys take.
[03:58] Just one more... come on take one more.
[04:01] She doesn't like any one of her pictures.
[04:05] You don't look nice, sister will you take one of us?
I'll take it.
[04:11] No, let me take it... give it to me.
Pass your phone...
[04:17] Give her your phone.
[04:21] Give her your phone.
[04:30] Take a nice one sister.
[04:35] Come on!
[04:43] Sister... if the picture isn't nice, please take another one.
[04:48] Sure...
These pictures are enough!
[04:58] This is my suit... Shela why did you wear it?
[05:10] Which dress? Which dress did I wear? I didn't wear any dress.
[05:18] Oh that one! I liked it...
[05:24] so I wore it.
[05:50] The time is near... ask where they are.
[05:58] Sure I'll find out. My dear bring my phone, it's inside.
[06:10] They should have been here by now.
[06:15] Is it fine?
Zaini... check and see if Mahi is ready or not.
[06:23] Today is her day, let her take as much time as she needs. Just be happy.
[06:29] Of course you are right Sarwat. But it's so late and we should at least know.
[06:35] Alright go and check.
[06:38] Let me ask Ahmed about the barat.
She gets so concerned.
[06:49] Here you are.
Thank you.
[07:07] The phone is ringing. I think it's a signal issue.
Try with his phone.
[07:11] Let me try one more time... it's them calling.
[07:18] Greetings brother Noor.
[07:20] We are waiting for you, everything is ready here. When will you guys be here?
[07:26] What... but...
[07:30] Brother Noor...
[07:34] Hello... brother Noor.
[07:39] Is everything alright?
[07:42] They have refused, they are saying that they are not coming
[07:50] Ahmed... Ahmed... call them. Ask where the barat is.
[07:57] Everyone is asking me, what should I answer them?
[08:03] They are not coming.
[08:07] What do you mean they aren't coming?
[08:10] I don't like this joking habit of yours.
[08:14] This is no occasion to joke. Ask them when they will be here.
[08:20] I told you that they are not coming.
[08:27] Why aren't they coming? My daughter is getting married, this is no joke.
[08:34] This is no way... pass me the phone.
Fareeda!
[09:14] Is the barat here Mirha?
[09:18] What's the matter? Why are you crying?
[09:22] They have refused to bring the barat.
What?
[09:57] Why didn't you say anything to them?
[09:59] How can they deceive us like this?
[10:04] Brother Ahmed is not replying.
[10:11] How will they agree? That's how liars are... they always attack your back.
[10:18] I've told you so many times not to send a proposal there.
[10:23] We should have married in our status.
[10:25] But you cared for your old neighborhood and your old friend.
[10:29] Look what happened because of it.
[10:33] Miss... I don't understand...
[10:38] how this happened.
[10:41] I was about to tell you mother...
[10:44] but I was so confused that I was wrong.
[10:47] I confirmed from a few friends and then told you about it.
[10:52] Thank God that we learned all of this before the wedding.
[10:56] What would we have done if we had learned this after the wedding?
[11:04] Zaviar... where are you going?
[11:14] Do you see how much we had to suffer because of one mistake.
[11:19] Look how worried he is...
[11:22] What  I don't understand...
[11:25] is how they deceive us like this?
[11:43] What did you do?
[11:46] You lied... you told me that you had told me about the divorce.
[11:55] Why did you lie to me?
[12:05] You lied!
[12:08] Brother Ahmed... everyone's watching.
[12:16] They are such liars and deceivers!
[12:19] I didn't expect them to be like this.
[12:21] She is marrying her daughter for a second time, that too by lying.
[12:25] I could never imagine this.
[12:27] You guys can go... we beg your forgiveness.
[12:30] Yes, we are leaving!
[12:32] What's the point of us staying here? Let's go everyone!
[13:18] Mahi!
[13:23] Mahi, please open the door.
[13:29] Mahi, please open the door.
[13:34] Auntie...
[13:40] Ahmed... listen to me
[13:42] Go away from here, I don't want to see you face.
[13:47] You betrayed me.
[13:52] By doing this you have ruined my daughter's life.
[13:57] You are her mother and you stole your daughter's happiness.
[14:08] You have murdered by trust.
[14:15] You told me that Mahi had told Zaviar about her divorce.
[14:21] Silence yourself.. I don't want to hear it.
[14:27] Whatever that happened today was because of you.
[14:32] Is this how you repay me for my trust?
[14:42] I didn't die when my son died, but today...
[14:48] you have buried me alive.
[14:52] I don't even have the strength to look people in they eye anymore.
[14:58] You have turned my honor into ashes.
[15:05] You did all of it.
[15:10] Do you know why brother Noor refused?
[15:15] Because they are respectable people who were looking for honorable people to marry into.
[15:23] They do not get married into liars like us!
[15:29] They do not!
[15:33] Everything is over Fareeda.
[15:40] Everything is over.
[15:48] Truth is the basis for a girl getting married.
[15:56] They are not built on lies you foolish woman!
[16:01] They are build on truth.
[16:10] Brother Ahmed.
[16:16] Brother.... bring water for your uncle.
[16:19] Bring a seat...
[16:23] Brother Ahmed sit down.
[19:02] Why did you do this to me Mahi?
[19:13] What did Saad wanted to say that he couldn't say in front of us?
[19:18] How do I know?
But I want to know what it is.
[19:22] Adnan... why do you involve yourself in other people's business?
[19:31] Do you see what they do behind my back!?
[19:35] Didn't I tell you that they steal my things in my absence?
[19:38] What do you have to say now?
[19:40] Maheen this is something very minor. You're being angry for no reason.
[19:43] A minor thing?
[19:44] This is a minor thing to you?
[19:46] What if they steal something big, will you still say the same thing?
[19:51] Maheen enough!
[19:52] They are my sisters! You cannot say anything like that about them.
[19:55] If they are your sisters, will they do anything?
[19:57] What has she done? She just wore a suit, don't sister's share clothes?
[20:02] They are not my sisters, they are your sisters. They are my sisters-in-law.
[20:05] Do you see how she's differentiating?
[20:09] Don't you differentiate between me and your sisters?
[20:14] Look at her tongue?
[20:15] I'm justified to speak out,
[20:20] and if push comes to shove I will scream as well!
[20:24] Enough... you are making mountains out of mole hills.
[20:50] Mother... don't cry...
[20:53] Sister Mahi is crying as well, father is angry as well.
[21:00] I told Mahi not to do this, but she didn't listen to me.
[21:06] Mother... you shouldn't have listened to sister Mahi.
[21:09] How could I have known that this would happen.
[21:14] Father is angry at you as well.
[21:17] Are you here to add salt to my wounds.
[21:20] mom, I was just...
Enough! I don't need your sympathy.
[21:25] Go away from here!
[21:28] Mirha leave me alone... go.
[22:01] Sister...
What is it?
[22:03] Go and apologize to sister-in-law.
[22:06] I should apologize? Don't you see how unreasonable she is?
[22:12] Don't you see how bad things are around the house? Because of that brother is so angry.
[22:16] For our brother listen to me and apologize.
[22:26] What's the matter with you? Why are you so angry?
[22:30] Brother... sister, I made a mistake.
[22:35] I will never take any one of your things without your permission.
[22:39] Look at my hands, please forgive me and improve your mood.
[22:45] Go to you room.
[22:52] Are you happy now making my daughter apologize like that?
[22:57] And you Usama... what kind of brother are you watching all this?
[23:05] What do you want from me? You two tell you me what you want from me?
[23:10] I've tolerated enough... I will not let your wife have her way anymore!
[23:16] If she can fight so much over a suit, then Lord knows what she might do over something major.
[23:20] Maheen listen to me with open ears...
[23:24] if you can't give this house a child, then there's no place in this house for you.
[23:28] It's the same thing every day!
[26:55] Where's Zara? Making tea?
[26:59] I was saying that we should prepare to leave.
[27:03] It seems what we came here for won't be happening.
[27:07] I don't feel like leaving my brother.
[27:10] My brother is in pain and I can't stand to see him like this.
[27:17] Sister did this... she always makes my brother restless.
[27:24] Don't say such things, this will make things bad for Zara.
[27:29] Good... we'll take her with us.
[27:33] Mother... I will not go.
[27:39] What do you mean? You told me...
[27:44] that as soon as the wedding ends you will come home with us...
[27:48] I did mother but...
[27:50] things were different back then. Everyone needs me here.
[27:57] Whatever happened here was because of sister and Mahi.
[28:00] I don't want you live here in such a stressful environment.
[28:05] I can't be selfish about this. There is only one reason behind what Mahi did.
[28:11] She feared that if they learned the truth they might break off the relationship.
[28:14] What changed? The relationship has been broken.
[28:17] Why did they lie? They shouldn't have. Have they no sense?
[28:23] Mahi is in a bad state. Uncle is worried as well...
[28:27] please don't say anything like that to him as well.
[28:31] That's why I'm asking you to come with us. You cannot stay happy here.
[28:38] Mother, you guys should go there.
[28:40] What about your sister's and brother's weddings?
[28:45] You are there with them... my prayers are with them. I cannot go there right now.
[28:53] Father... make her understand.
[28:56] Wait a minute. End this conversation...
[29:00] Let's do what Zara is saying. 
[29:05] Do as you please... we will not pressurize you.
[29:10] Thank you father.
[29:15] Mother did you keep your medicine?
[29:22] I don't know... maybe.
I'll help you pack.
[29:40] You guys were supposed to come back after two days.
[29:46] How come you're back so early?
[29:51] Such was the situation. I don't know how to tell you.
[29:57] May God have mercy... what happened?
[30:02] Is Zara okay?
Yes she is...
[30:08] What we went there for couldn't happen...
[30:11] the groom's family refused to show up at the vital moment.
[30:16] Sister didn't tell them about Mahi's first marriage.
[30:27] My God!
[30:30] How can sister lie about something like that?
[30:37] She must have lied for her daughter.
[30:40] Don't take it the wrong way but your niece is very sharp.
[30:45] She bothered Zara so much. What she's facing is karma, right brother?
[30:54] What we reap..
[30:59] is what we sow.
[31:04] Often in life... because of our mistakes... other people suffer...
[31:14] Which is something we don't realize. Whatever that happened to Mahi...
[31:21] was tragic. Rather than checking whose fault it was, we must think...
[31:29] how to get out of this situation.
You are right but..
[31:37] what about Mahi? She has been defamed in front of her extended family.
[31:44] What can we say?
[31:46] God will make everything better. 
[31:49] I pray that things get better over there as well.
[31:53] Amen.
[32:05] Uncle.
[32:07] I know that all of you are worried at the moment.
[32:12] But I want to talk to you all about something, in private.
[32:25] Let's go Shaista... allow us to leave brother.
[32:29] What's the matter Saad?
[32:50] What did Saad wanted to talk about that he couldn't say in front of us?
[32:54] What do I know?
But I want to find out what it is.
[32:58] Adnan... why do you have a habit of interfering in other people's business?
[33:02] You could try focusing on us as well.
[33:04] For God's sake don't start again... 
[33:06] things have gotten better for us after such a long time. Let me hear.
[33:13] If someone hears... Adnan let's go..
Uncle Adnan...
[33:19] Why are you guys standing here? Who's inside?
[33:21] Saad is back... he's here to talk to your mother-in-law.
[33:26] Don't you know what it is?
No.
[33:30] Yes, Saad is here.
[33:32] He wanted to talk about something important, that's why we came outside.
[33:36] Yes go inside.
We should leave Adnan.
[33:40] Let's go.
[33:58] Uncle the thing is that...
[34:03] I cannot marry right now.
[34:16] I want some time.
[34:20] What do you need time for?
[34:26] We thought that you were happy with the decision.
[34:29]  It never occurred to us that you would have a problem with this.
[34:33] What's the matter?
I know...
[34:37] I don't have any objections.
[34:41] Then what's the matter? Why aren't you telling us?
[34:47] I respect you uncle.
[34:51] After father's death, I've always put you in his place.
[34:57] From school till college you were always there for my admissions.
[35:03] You were the the one who got me enrolled in university
[35:08] Like Ali, you always thought of me as your son.
[35:14] You never made me realize that I was an orphan.
[35:19] That I don't have a father.
[35:22] You took care of all my likes and dislikes...
[35:28] I...
[35:30] I respect all of your decisions but...
[35:37] I cannot marry right now.
[35:42] The only reason behind that is that...
[35:47] I want to stand on my feet.
[35:53] Uncle... I just got hired...
[35:57] I want to work very hard.
[36:01] I want to be...
[36:05] worthy of your daughter.
[36:23] I don't want...
[36:26] Zaini to ask me of something in the future and I am unable to give it to her.
[36:33] I won't like it.
[36:38] I want to give her all the happiness in the world.
[36:44] That's why I want some time.
[36:50] But... things could still happen the same way.
[36:55] Do we have shortage of anything? 
[36:57] Dolly won't ask anything of us, nor Zaini will demand anything of you.
[37:03] I know auntie... but as a big brother it's my duty...
[37:09] that I give my sister everything that she deserves on her wedding day.
[37:14] And... as a husband I want to make Zaini happy.
[37:20] That's why I'm asking some time.
[37:23] You're acting like a stranger.
[37:26]  Both weddings will be arranged together. I'm here.
[37:33] Uncle... you've been there for us ever since we were children.
[37:39] But... I don't to take away Zaini using the money...
[37:45] that you would give me. Do you understand?
[37:52] I want to stand on my feet and keep Zaini happy.
[37:58] So...
[38:00] So that she doesn't feel that she chose the wrong man.
[38:08] That's why I'm asking you for some time. Please give me some time.
[38:17] I promise that I will always keep Zaini happy. I will never make her cry.
[38:26] She will never regret her decision.
[38:34] Bless you my son.
[38:38] I'm proud of you... your parents have raised you well.
[38:46] Thank you uncle.
