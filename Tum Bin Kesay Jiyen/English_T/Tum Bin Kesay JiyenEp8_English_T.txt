[00:12] That place isn't good for you.
[00:16] Brother Adeel is a good man, no one says anything to him.
[00:20] Try talking to him once
[00:23] He will realize that the reason we wanted him to shift to Karachi...
[00:28] is his mother and sister.
[00:30] Manzoor, there is still time
[00:33] if you're concerned about Sarah's happiness, then let me tell you that she won't be able to stay happy there.
[00:38] Stop talking like an illiterate.
[00:40] Adeel! You're calling your mother illiterate because of you in-laws?
[00:45] You prefer your in-laws over your family over something so trivial?
[00:50] Stop taking the wrong meaning of what I said.
[00:53] Do you need to create a scene over everything?
[00:55] I will create a scene now.
[00:57] Where were you when father threatened to divorce mother because of Zara.
[01:02] I will create a scene now!
[01:12] Listen, did you find out anything?
[01:18] Adeel is coming.
[01:21] Why are you so surprised? I knew he would come along.
[01:26] It is surprising to me.
[01:29] When Zara refused to marry him...
[01:32] still he's coming. I feel scared.
[01:38] What's there to be scared of? He wanted to come here and so he is.
[01:44] A man who couldn't get any girl has gotten Zara, why wouldn't he show up?
[01:53] Think before you speak. You say whatever that comes to mind.
[01:57] There is no fixing you. May God help you.
[02:29] Zara.
[02:32] Brother Adeel is here and father is asking for you.
[02:36] Zaini... I feel afraid.
[02:42] What will that do? That will do nothing.
[02:47] What we have to see now is what brother Adeel has decided and what he can do for you.
[02:53] What if he doesn't agree?
[02:57] Still it will be your decision,
[03:00] because father has given you the authority to make a decision.
[03:05] It's up to you what you decide.
[03:11] If Adeel gets angry and...
Everyone is waiting for you outside.
[03:19] Please, come quickly.
[04:11] My dear, how's everyone at home and how's Meerah?
[04:18] She's better now. Actually no one could come with me because of Meerah's health.
[04:25] That's why I had to come alone.
[04:27] It's alright son...
[04:30] Every family has it compulsions.
[04:33] Compulsion neither make relationships nor are they maintained.
[04:37] Either uncle or auntie should have been here.
[04:42] Silence my dear, your father is speaking.
No auntie...
[04:48] sister Maheen is right.
[04:56] All of you know why mother didn't show up.
[05:01] Father wanted to come but uncle refused.
[05:07] It doesn't matter who came and who didn't.
[05:21] I'm ashamed in front of you all.
[05:26] Zara, in front of you as well.
[05:35] I wanted to apologize to you all.
[05:48] I don't know what you must be thinking...
[05:54] but I have decided something.
[06:06] Zara is married to me...
[06:09] and she is my responsibility.
[06:14] And I cannot leave my mother and sister as well.
[06:19] That's why I have decided.
[06:23] What?
[06:38] What is this? What is this file for?
[06:46] These are documents for Zara's new home. Father has decided...
[06:51] that after our marriage, Zara will live with me in this new house.
[07:02] If you guys have no objections, could you guys provide me a date. I want to bring a barat this month.
[07:20] There was no need for this. We could have resolved this some other way.
[07:28] There is nothing hidden from you. You know why father made this decision.
[07:34] This matter will create more complications. May God helps us.
[07:41] Sister Fareeda will never agree to this.
[07:44] I am not in favor of this as well.
[07:51] Don't worry about that.
[07:54] Father said that he will talk to mother and she will listen to him.
[07:59] I just want permission from all of you.
[08:03] I want to bring the barat this month.
[08:11] If you guys have no objections.
[08:14] We need some time to think.
[08:22] Okay. Please do think about it.
[08:27] But I hope that the decision will be in my favor.
[08:36] We will try.
[08:49] Thank you uncle.
[08:55] Uncle if you allow me...
[08:59] I want to talk to Zara alone.
[09:05] Sure... son, why not.
[09:09] Sure son.
[09:11] Go.
[09:52] This will make matter worst.
[09:57] You started praying...
Stop it...
[10:01] This was necessary.
[10:09] May God give my brother a long life.
[10:32] I'm sure your sister asked to give that plot to Zara.
[10:38] No... the credit for this goes to you as well.
[10:42] Those poor souls don't know anything about this.
Poor souls?
[10:47] Really... so they are poor souls?
[10:51] Are poor souls supposed to say things like this?
[10:55] First that accursed Zara stole my son from me.
[11:00] And now... she'll have that plot transferred to her name.
[11:04] Even after that you're sympathizing with her?
[11:10] Zara didn't talk to me about this.
[11:14] Besides she's not that cunning.
[11:17] She's just scared by what you did.
[11:21] And I did this for her protection.
[11:24] Before you make her life hell she can live with her husband in that house.
[11:33] So what you're trying to say is that...
[11:39] your sister has no hand in this.
[11:44] Do I look like a kid to you?
[11:47] Do you expect to believe everything you to tell me?
[11:50] Really!
[11:53] So tell me... Adeel and I...
[11:59] do we seem kids to you? Should we listen to you?
[12:05] You are separating a mother from her son!
[12:10] Ahmed... for your sister you are being unjust towards your wife.
[12:16] What if I tell you that you're separating a husband from his wife...
[12:22] In trying to fight with your in-laws you are being unjust with your son.
[12:30] These are not your words Mr. Ahmed.
[12:36] You are speaking like Sarwat.
[12:40] She taught you these things, right? You are threatening me because of her, right?
[12:47] You stole my son from me.
[12:51] I will never forgive you.
[12:57] Neither you... neither Sarwat...
[13:02] neither Adeel... or that accursed Zara!
[13:07] One request... there is no need to bother me.
[13:12] And let it stay that way!
[13:18] Alright... then do one thing...
[13:22] The plot you've bought for Zara, have a house built there...
[13:27] Go there alone and bring back your beloved Zara...
[13:33] alone and take her to that house. Me and my daughters won't go.
[13:41] Nor will I see Zara's face for the rest of my life.
[13:50] If you want I can shift there as well.
[14:04] Where have I found myself?
[14:07] I'm surprised that you guys don't understand that this matter wasn't concerning Adeel.
[14:13] This matter was concerning Maham and auntie.
[14:15] Why aren't they here to apologize.
[14:18] Adeel is back on their behalf and you guys are listening to him.
[14:26] Maheen you are right in your own way.
[14:29] But Adeel is the son-in-law of this house.
[14:33] And it's hard for a son-in-law to arrive at his in-laws and apologize.
[14:37] Still by coming here he's proving that he won't harm Zara.
[14:43] Pardon me father, but it's hard for a girl to live at a place where her parents aren't respected.
[14:51] Besides, by coming here Adeel has proved...
[14:56] that he's helpless in front of his mother and sister.
[15:00] If he couldn't make them realize their mistake, then who will he protect Zara's rights?
[15:06] Maheen, brother Ahmed has told us that if Adeel and Zara have a hard time adjusting there...
[15:12] then he'll built a different house for them. What more can he do?
[15:16] But mother, brother Adeel also said...
[15:19] that he won't leave his sisters and mother.
[15:22] Then what is the point in building a different home?
[15:25] He won't separate from them.
What kind of stupid conversation is this?
[15:30] Separating one's home and leaving it is two different things.
[15:36] If Adeel has stated that he can't leave his mother and sisters,
[15:40] that doesn't mean he will pressurize Zara to live with them.
[15:49] Remember one thing...
[15:53] Girls who have their husbands leaves their parents are fools.
[16:03] If a man can leave his parents...
[16:07] then it's nothing for him to leave his wife.
[16:14] Alright fine... first ask him build his home...
[16:19] When his house is build, we'll marry off Zara, so that she can live there.
[16:25] That's senseless.
[16:28] That is being stubborn for no reason. Adeel said...
[16:31] that he will not let Zara be bothered there.
[16:35] But mother...
Enough... I've heard enough.
[16:43] I'm Zara's father. I'm here when she gets hurt. I'll take care of her.
[16:51] I will not let anything unjust happen to her.
[16:55] All of you go to sleep.
[17:17] Speak mother... why are you silent?
[17:21] What was the point in creating such a scene? Rather we lost and Zara won.
[17:29] She has become the owner millions.
[17:33] No she hasn't...
[17:37] I remained empty handed. I didn't get anything.
[17:41] Zara stole everything. Sarwat won and I lost.
[17:48] Her daughter has become the owner of my house.
[17:52] Do you see? Who asked you to unveil everything in front of everyone?
[18:00] I'm not like everyone else... I don't hide my emotions.
[18:04] I'm used to being straight forward.
[18:10] You asked a straight forward question and got a straight forward answer.
[18:14] I told you so many times not to be impatient. Don't make things worse than they already are.
[18:23] Why have you accepted defeat?
[18:29] This game has just started.
[18:32] Why have you already determined who won and lost?
[18:39] I don't understand anything.
[18:42] I'm going crazy thinking that Sarmad's daughter...
[18:48] would come here in my home.
[18:53] She will stay in my house as my daughter-in-law.
[18:56] She will be right before my eyes all the time.
[18:58] If you think from your heart it will only bother your brain.
[19:02] You've seen what haste bring. We cannot tolerate anymore losses.
[19:09] Try listening to me once.
What should I listen to?
[19:15] Should I bring Sarwat's daughter here? No way!
[19:20] I won't be able to do this.
There's nothing to lose.
[19:25] To tell you the truth you have no other option. Why do you want to get embarrassed?
[19:33] Who listens to you?
[19:36] Why are you constantly saying that you won't allow Zara here?
[19:42] Who's asking for your permission.
I cannot do this!
[19:49] I won't be able to do this. Should I make Sarwat's daughter...
[19:55] my daughter-in-law? Should I let that snake's daughter marry my son?
[20:01] No... never... I've told your father...
[20:06] I've told him that I won't let this marriage happen. I won't go there!
[20:12] You will have to... whether you do that smiling or crying.
[20:17] You will have to. That's what I'm trying to make you understand.
[20:23] Try listening to them once...
[20:27] moving forwards you can have your way.
[20:32] And Zara...
[20:34] alongside the family, she has a house now as well. What will you do if she takes away your son?
[20:41] How will Zara take away my son...
[20:45] when my son will run willingly behind her.
[20:49] He's so madly in love with her that he can't see his mother.
[20:54] That's what I've been trying to tell you. Listen to me.
[21:03] We won't let him go so easily.
[21:07] Whether Zara takes away Adeel, or Adeel decides to leave.
[21:11] We have to stop him.
[21:13] You have build a wall of love in front of him. Adeel will not go anywhere.
[21:21] Trust me... he will not be able to leave.
[21:29] Just this once, listen to me.
[21:33] Alright.
[21:53] He gave you this house, not me.
You know why he did this.
[21:59] Yes, so that we can be together.
[22:05] He solved our problem.
[22:07] Our problems supposed to be solved this way?
[22:09] A separate house will create more problems.
[22:23] I'm afraid Zara.
[22:28] Father wants our marriage to be done as quickly as possible.
[22:32] The solution you found for this was...
[22:35] to buy me a separate home?
[22:38] What's so bad about that?
[22:42] You refused because of mother and Maham, right?
[22:45] You were worried what they might do in the future.
[22:50] You didn't want to live with them, right? I didn't do this, father did.
[22:58] He gifted this house to you.
You should have stopped him.
[23:03] How could have I? He gave you this house, not me.
[23:08] You know why he did this.
Yes.
[23:13] So that we can be together. That's why he solved this problem.
[23:19] Are problems supposed to be solved this way?
[23:21] A separate house will create more problems.
[23:27] Separating hearts won't solve any problems as well.
[23:31] Compromise is what solves problems.
[23:35] You called and told me that you won't marry me.
[23:40] Not once did you think how I would have felt.
[23:44] You were hurt and you called me in anger. Think about it...
[23:49] What would have I done if I had gotten offended by that?
[24:01] But I didn't do that?
[24:04] We would have gotten married, but we never would have been close.
[24:08] God forbid!
[24:10] God forbid, but that's what people want. They want to separate us.
[24:24] Promise me... no matter what happens...
[24:30] From now you won't say anything like this.
[24:36] I won't.
[24:52] Then talk to your family to finalize a date quickly.
[24:57] How can I do that?
Why not? Didn't you say it before?
[25:06] Father said that he will let us know by tomorrow.
[25:14] What do you think?
[25:16] Will he give me a date of this month?
[25:21] I don't know.
[25:24] Even if father provides you a date for this month,
[25:27] will you be able to convince Maham and auntie?
[25:31] Leave that to me. Didn't you hear?
[25:35] Abroad people celebrate their marriage... and here we try to convince our aunts.
[25:42] No one could have imagined that things would be opposite with me.
[25:47] Rather than convincing my aunt, I have to convince my mother.
[25:55] What if...
[25:58] What if they don't agree?
[26:03] Even if they don't, even then no one could separate us.
[26:10] In this life no one can separate us, apart from death.
[26:16] Adeel... why do you say such things?
[26:24] Sorry...
[26:26] I will not do it again.
[26:37] Promise?
[26:39] Promise.
[26:43] Don't cry now.
[27:05] Shaista... Shaista... where are you?
[27:14] Look at this... look what's going on downstairs.
[27:20] Why did you make this video?
To show you.
[27:25] I have no interest in these things.
Just once, watch this video.
[27:29] What's the matter with you Adnan?
[27:33] You record every call and now with this video, what do you want to achieve?
[27:38] These are useful things that might come handy.
[27:46] Here you are... I've deleted it.
Why did you delete it?
[27:50] Why did you make it? Have you no shame?
No I don't.
[28:03] She ruined my hardwork.
[28:05] Can't you do this for me? What kind of friend are you?
[28:10] I don't know... you are coming to meet. Just for a little while.
[28:17] And then do that other thing I asked you to do. I'll get my phone back.
[28:25] I'm telling you it's no issue.
[28:29] Okay, thank you... I'll wait for you. Come here directly from college.
[28:36] Okay. Farewell.
[28:51] Hello Aqib... were you sleeping?
[28:57] No, I talked to her.
[29:01] She will come tomorrow.
[29:03] She will give me a phone and that will be the end of my phone problem.
[29:08] You tell me..
[29:13] Listen...
[29:16] tell me what's the matter? Why are you upset?
[29:20] You didn't talk to me our entire way here.
[29:24] I'm worried for Zara.
[29:29] Sometimes it feels that what she's doing is correct.
[29:33] Then sometimes I feel like what she's doing is wrong.
[29:39] It's not important how you feel, what's important is what Zara feels.
[29:45] It seems that brother Adeel is right. Whatever he says is right.
[29:50] She doesn't understand what we're trying to tell her.
[29:55] Why don't you make her understand.
[29:58] She listens to you and you saw what happened there
[30:03] She won't understand.
[30:05] She only understands Adeel.
[30:08] I tried to make her understand but she didn't listen.
[30:12] Brother Ali said the same thing... she has asked us to let her take her decision.
[30:19] He has asked her not to confuse her. But I think we should save her from harming herself.
[30:27] This is what love is like... one doesn't feel that they are getting burned...
[30:35] Not unless they burn themselves entirely. And that is how Zara loves Adeel.
[30:44] Pray that there is no fire in the place her love takes her.
[30:53] All we can do is pray for her.
[30:57] You're right... It's time for my class... you go ahead.
[31:04] Take care... farewell.
[31:30] Sister... what are you doing?
[31:33] Come in Shaista... I'm not doing anything.
[31:36] Many congratulations!
[31:39] What happened?
The istikhara was in your favor.
[31:43] I talked to sister Shabnam,
[31:45] she also said that it's good to send a girl to her home, immediately after her marriage.
[31:50] We shouldn't make them stay home. It's against our religion.
[31:54] Who did the istikhara?
[31:56] I did, who else? Not one of my istikhara has ever been wrong.
[32:02] I decided to tell you only if I had good news. That's why I was waiting.
[32:08] I also donated food to charity.
[32:12] Is that the truth?
[32:14] The istikhara was in our favor?
Yes it was.
[32:19] Many congratulations! I don't know why you don't believe me.
[32:23] I haven't slept since three night just because you were worried.
[32:28] Did you tell your brother?
[32:29] I came here to tell him. Where is he?
[32:32] He just left for the market.
[32:34] Once he comes back we'll tell him about the good news.
[32:39] All of our tensions will end. Thank you God and bless you.
[32:45] Will you not get anything sweet? Call brother...
[32:50] he'll get in from the market on his way back.
Why not!
[32:56] I'll call him right away... and make tea for you as well.
[33:01] I'll chop the vegetables for you.
[33:02] My dear, make two cups of tea.
[33:10] My dear... it's bee some time since you visited. 
[33:13] Is everything alright at your home?
[33:15] Yes auntie... I couldn't wait when I heard of Meha... 
[33:19] I got home early from college, so I decided to visit her.
[33:23] It's good you came here.
[33:27] And... how's Hadi?
[33:32] Did she get better, or is she the same?
[33:36] I'm sure she must bother your mother a lot.
[33:39] Don't you know that brother Nouman is divorced.
[33:44] What? He got divorced?
[33:48] I didn't know that. When did that happen?
[33:55] I mean... when did this occur?
[33:59] You were right... we finally got rid of her.
[34:02] We've started looking for a different girl for brother Nouman.
[34:06] Really... ask your mother to be careful when they select a girl this time.
[34:14] To learn her lesson from the first one. 
[34:17] Ask her not to repeat her mistake.
[34:19] We didn't choose the girl first time, brother Nouman chose her.
[34:25] Mother was against her from the first day.
[34:27] Now that he's divorced, your mother will choose a girl for your brother, right?
[34:34] Pray that happens. May I see Meha?
[34:40] Sure go ahead...
[34:46] His brother got divorced.
[34:49] What were you saying about her mother?
[34:52] That she was stupid. After her son started earning, she started showing off!
[34:57] Tell me, what do you have to say about her?
What can I say?
[35:01] I will say what my elders used to say...
[35:07] Like an old woman, who went insane and but didn't lose her way.
[35:10] Yes... that's the one!
I always forgot what this meant.
[35:17] You used to remind me. I'll remind you today.
[35:22] No matter how foolish one gets, they don't forget their incentive
[35:29] What are you thinking about?
[35:33] I went to father's room... he had a headache. 
[35:35] I gave him tea and you should give him medicine.
[35:40] I can't just go to him and tell him...
[35:45] Didn't you sleep last night? 
[35:47] You did, right? I'm sure you saw a dream.
[35:51] You saw Zara becoming a bride and in her hand...
[35:56] I would place a burning coal.
[36:00] Anyways... I'll go and drive away your father's headache.
[36:15] I'm so sorry Zara... I had to do this.
[36:21] But your sister Maheen is to blame for this.
[36:27] She taunted me of my divorce. 
[36:31] I don't have a habit of listening to taunts...
[36:34] I rather return them with interest.
[36:41] Keep this money. 
[36:43] I've told Aqib, he'll take it from you outside the academy today, alright?
[36:48] Are you insane? 
[36:50] How can someone take this money and find something stolen?
[36:55] Aqib said that we will pay the police this money and then they will help us.
[37:01] He's fooling you. 
[37:03] Snatchers don't submit what they stole inside a police station.
[37:07] How does the police know who stole your phone?
[37:11]  Your phone must have been sold by now.
[37:13] You don't know how well connected Aqib is... 
[37:16] he said he'll do it, and I trust him.
[37:19] And... you'll see the next time I call you will be from my old phone.
[37:24] You just don't listen.
Keep that money in your bag.
[37:31] Mother, write it down. 
[37:33] This woman didn't do any istikhara nor did she take advice from an wise lady.
[37:37] She doesn't need to take advice from someone when she knows she might gain something.
[37:43] Are you insane? It's not good to be suspicious of everyone.
[37:48] I'm not insane. 
[37:51] Madam Shaista is making a fool out of you so that she can live in this house.
[37:55] And that she doesn't have to pay rent.
[37:58] You have all that going on in your head.
[38:01] How do you think of all this?
[38:03] Because I've left this heavenly house of yours and see the world
