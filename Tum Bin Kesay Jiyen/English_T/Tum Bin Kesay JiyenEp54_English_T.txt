[00:12] the condition of both of us is same
[00:17] but maybe its my bad luck that... 
[00:21] I have eaten your happiness
[00:23] its not only the fault of your luck in it
[00:29] also, my bad luck plays a vital role in it
[00:31]  Zara won't go anywhere
[00:34] are you guys listening? Zara will not go anywhere, She is my wife
[00:38]  and if you guys uttered a single word against Zara then I will leave this house
[00:44] and Zara will go with me 
[00:48]  what was she saying?
[00:52] she said that they will bring the wedding procession day after tomorrow 
[00:55] really? 
yes... they are bringing wedding procession
[01:00] really?
[01:21] its not a bad deal
[01:25] if I get that house transferred on my name
[01:31] then I can also become rich
[01:35] and then I will go somewhere far away from here after selling that house
[01:43] I won't get any better chance than this
[01:50] otherwise, what did I get by staying here for so many years?
[01:55] Nothing
[01:57] now I've got a chance so I should take full advantage of it
[02:04] but for now, I don't have the money to buy the file. From where shall I arrange it?
[04:17] Saad, dear come a bit early from the office as we have some important work to do for tomorrow
[04:23] yes mom, I will come after taking a half day
[04:26] and Dolly, at what time do you have to go to the parlor?
[04:28] at 12pm
[04:30] okay, I will drop you
[04:31] shall I come along with you?
[04:33] yes dear, you may go. Its alright. There are a few house chores, I will manage
[04:40] as it is, I've invited a few relatives
[04:44] mom, what is the need of it? Its our family function
[04:48] dear, its important. Now I have to tell the people about your marriage as well
[04:53] that by what status Zara is living here, before people start asking me
[05:08] ok mom, as you find better
[05:15] Dolly, do you want something else?
[05:17] no brother, everything is done. Just take me there on time
[05:24] mom, don't worry I will manage everything
[05:52] come in
[05:56] are you ready?
[05:59] All praise to God, you are looking so pretty
[06:04] thank you!
[06:06] actually..
[06:09] I wanted to discuss something with you
[06:12] even I want to talk to you
[06:14] yes, tell me what happened?
[06:17] I don't understand how shall I say it
[06:22] Dolly, whatever is there in your heart you can say that to me
[06:27] I am leaving this house today forever
[06:31] and...
[06:33] I have never left mom alone
[06:36] I used to be with her at all times
[06:42] today, when I am leaving so I am feeling so worried about her
[06:50] I know, maybe you'll find it a bit selfish
[06:55] but... there is no one else in this house except for you
[07:00] brother goes to the office in the morning, and mom stays alone at home for an entire day
[07:09] Zara, will you promise me one thing?
[07:15] you will take care of mom right?
[07:20] I was angry on you, Zara
[07:23] because I was getting your share of punishment
[07:26] but... now this punishment is finished
[07:31] So, even I don't want to keep any grudge in my heart
[07:35] and I want to give my mom's responsibility to you
[07:42] even if you hadn't said all this to me
[07:45] still I would have taken good care of aunt
[07:48] and whatever you've been through because of me, Dolly
[07:53] I can only apologize for it
[07:57] I would like you to remove all the complains & misunderstandings from your mind & heart before going from here
[08:05] and fill my brother's life with happiness
[08:08] my brother loves you a lot
[08:13] get ready, meanwhile let me check on aunty
[08:17] okay
[08:25] Zaini
[08:27] hey! What happened dear, you haven't got ready as of yet?
[08:31] mom, I don't want to go
[08:38] its your only brother's wedding, dear
what answer I will give to the people when they'll ask about you
[08:44] mom, Saad will be there... also Zara will be there
I don't want to face them or meet them!
[08:51] please don't force me, I don't want to go there
[08:54] dear, this is not the matter of only one day. Its a lifetime's issue
[09:01] if not today, then tomorrow you have to face them
[09:06] mom, we'll look at the future later
[09:09] right now I don't have the courage
[09:13] you are my very courageous daughter
[09:17] right?
[09:19] you know, sometimes we don't have to live for ourselves but for the happiness of others
[09:27] if you won't go then your brother will not take the wedding procession
[09:32] he had already said it
[09:35] now tell me
[09:38] what shall we do?
[09:42] come on, my good girl. Get up, get ready
[10:58] aunty had asked me to wear these clothes
[11:02] although I didn't wanted to wear such heavy clothes
[11:05] you are looking nice
[11:13] what?
[11:15] why are you worried?
[11:22] I am feeling scared
[11:25] about what?
[11:29] the groom's family is about to come
[11:32] are you afraid of that fact that how people will react after seeing you?
[11:46] I am thinking not to go in front of them
[11:48] Zara, in the same manner even I don't have the right to meet anyone
[11:53] but I will face everyone
[11:55] I won't be able to do it, Saad
[12:02] I am with you
[12:06] Zara, we are the support for each other
[12:11] we'll tremble together & handle ourselves together
[12:21] nothing wrong shall happen today
[12:24] I pray that Dolly goes to her house safely
[12:27] nothing will happen
[12:30] and fix your mood
[12:35] you look so bad while crying
[16:43] everything is looking so good
[16:50] take this...
thank you!
[17:05] brother Fahad, come... let me introduce you to Mirha's family
[17:08] yes
[17:09] Shall we?
[17:17] Greetings aunty!
Greetings dear!
[17:21] how are you?
[17:22] I'm absolutely fine, how are you?
[17:24] I am also fine
[17:25] you are looking so pretty
thank you so much! He is my cousin Fahad
[17:29] Greetings aunty!
Greetings! Stay blessed
[17:33] aunty, what are you doing here? Come on the stage
[17:35] yes yes, lets go. Come on
[20:42] you & Zara don't need to worry about anything
[20:48] as far as your mother is concerned
[20:52] don't worry
[20:54] I will never let her do any injustices with Zara
[21:01] I know
[21:15] you know what?
[21:17] you are the best father in the world
[21:22] you are my dear best son
[22:17] my son was so proud of Zara 
[22:20] but not even a year had passed of his demise & Zara got married
[22:26] Enough be quiet! 
[22:28] Don't lie..
[22:32] your hatred ate away all the happiness of this family
[22:45] you are looking beautiful
[22:50] why didn't you say it before?
[22:53] when?
[22:54] earlier
[22:56] a lot of people were there, how come I would have said?
[22:59] why?
[23:01] are you afraid of accepting it in front of all?
[23:05] no, its not the matter
[23:06] actually I wanted it to say it in private
[23:11] really?
[23:14] just a while ago you didn't wanted to marry me as well
[23:18] you weren't attending my calls, nor answering me. You were ready to break our relation
[23:24] and now you are feeling loved towards me
[23:28] see, your every complaint is valid
[23:31] but... I was compelled
[23:35] the situation was as such that I couldn't do anything, I...
[23:39] Ali...
[23:41] will you always stay like this?
[23:45] will you ask for a sacrifice from me, if there will be any problem in someone else's relationship or life?
[23:51] what kind of love is this?
[23:54] Fine, I agree that love needs sacrifices but...
[23:59] but Ali, a husband & a wife's relation is not like this
[24:03] since when a husband & a wife's relation has become so delicate that they become a puppet for others?
[24:09] it means...
[24:12] you will leave me in the future upon anyone's orders
[24:18] what will happen to me then?
[24:21] where will I go? And in front of whom I will cry, Ali?
[24:24] Look, its not like that. Why will I leave you?
[24:30] I agree that I made a mistake & I apologize to you for the same
[24:36] please forgive me
[24:40] and...
[24:42] believe me... I will never put you in any trial ever
[24:48] I promise you!
[24:53] Ali..
[24:55] Ali, you are my strength
[24:58] I am nothing without you
[25:02] me too
[25:03] believe me
[25:09] Okay, I've brought something for you
[25:13] really?
[25:20] Wow! its beautiful
[25:23] its nice right?
very nice
[25:25] give me your hand
[25:38] wow!
[25:39] you like it?
[25:40] whose choice is it? Yours or mom's?
[25:44] mine...
Okay
[25:46] its very nice, I love it. Thank you so much!
[26:39] Sarwat
[26:42] how are you?
[26:48] are you still upset with your brother?
[26:54] I was missing you a lot
[27:04] Sarwat..
[27:07] Sarwat, I know you are listening to my voice
[27:13] won't you forgive your brother?
[27:20] say something, Sarwat
[27:23] I am yearning to hear your voice
[27:32] don't take my trial like this, Sarwat
[27:36] you shouldn't have call here
[27:41] Sarwat, I know I shouldn't have called
[27:48] but do you remember
[27:51] our mother always used to tell me to take good care of your little sister
[27:59] no matter even if she is upset with you
[28:04] and what you did?
[28:06] you've only hurt your sister
[28:10] you had never been the reason of your sister's peace
[28:13] right?
[28:15] Sarwat, I never wanted to become a reason of your pain
[28:25] you were not alone in hurting me
[28:28] your wife, your daughter... everyone had put an equivalent share
[28:34] nobody had never left anything
[28:39] I know
[28:41] I know, Sarwat
[28:44] I apologize to you on their behalf
[28:48] there is no possibility of forgiveness now, brother
[28:52] maybe earlier I would have forgiven you but now..
[28:56] my every relation with you is over like I did with Zara
[29:00] along with Zara! What happened to Zara?
[29:04] where is Zara, is she fine?
[29:07] really!
[29:08] didn't your wife or daughter told you that where Zara is?
[29:14] I didn't get it, where is Zara?
[29:20] she got married
[29:21] Sarwat!
[29:23] what are you saying?
[29:25] with whom you got Zara married?
[29:27] go ask your wife, go ask your daughter
[29:31] we were wedding off our daughter secretly, but she had ruined our leftover honor by coming there
[29:42] what!
[29:43] what is left now?
[29:45] for God sake leave me & my family on our own
[29:49] let us live peacefully now!
[30:54] oh God mom, Sadaf's ring was so pretty
[30:58] yes, also it seems so expensive too
[31:01] I think they are filthy rich people
[31:04] I have decided. I will get the two of you married into some rich family
[31:10] by the way Mirha, this new friend of yours. They seem quite rich as well
[31:17] whom do they have in their family?
[31:19] why are you asking?
[31:20] just like that, what happened?
[31:24] the entire house lights are on, your father didn't switched them off before sleeping
[31:30] I think, dad hasn't slept as of yet
[31:34] dad, you are still awake?
[31:38] why you haven't slept as of yet? What happened?
[31:42] I was trying to sleep
[31:45] in fact, I was trying to sleep forever
[31:47] oh God, what are you saying. God forbid! Talk good
[31:52] dad, maybe we got late that's why you are upset
[31:55] I'm sorry dad, we didn't realize the time
[31:59] and you know, we hardly get to know the time in the wedding ceremonies
[32:03] yes
[32:04] I am talking to your mother, Mirha
Don't interfere!
[32:08] what happened, at least tell me something. What have I done now?
[32:13] Mirha is telling you that why we got late
[32:16] people do get late at such occasions
[32:20] you get upset for no reason
[32:23] you guys shall go & rest, let me talk to him
[32:28] tell me, what's the problem?
[32:31] why both of you went to Karachi?
[32:34] Karachi?
Karachi...
[32:41] I am asking, why both of you went to Karachi? & for what?
[32:47] Fine, forgive us that we didn't tell you before going to Karachi
[32:54] I am asking you the last time, why did you go there?
[33:01] actually dad...
[33:04] when we got to know about Saad & Zara's wedding
[33:09] then I & mom, we...
[36:30] yes, what else we could have done?
[36:32] when we got the news that she is getting married, I couldn't handle it
[36:38] you know they always wanted it to happen
[36:43] my son was so proud of Zara
[36:47] but not even a year had passed of his demise & Zara got married
[36:52] Enough be quiet! Don't lie..
[36:58] your hatred ate away all the happiness of this family
[37:04] you didn't go there for your son
[37:08] you had gone to take out the frustration of your heart
[37:13] you always used to hate Sarwat & her daughters
[37:17] and what was the need for you to go there, when you had already got to know that Saad & Zara had got married?
[37:26] I have lost all of my relations because of you
[37:33] dad please..
[37:34] you don't leave a chance to hurt me
[37:40] dad please...
[37:41] quiet!
[37:44] I don't want to talk to you
[37:49] you already took complete revenge from Zara
[37:54] for God sake leave her
[37:57] let her live her life
[38:04] I cannot tolerate anymore drama now
[38:36] we are always blamed for everything
[38:40] he can't see the antics of his dearest niece
[39:17] Saad
[39:20] yes
[39:22] are you missing Zaini?
[39:31] I can clearly see the pain of loosing you in Zaini's eyes
[39:39]  in your eyes too
[39:47] You must be missing Zaini a lot
[39:54] do you know
[39:58] even I miss Adeel a lot
[40:02] but I know where he is
[40:07] how Zaini must be feeling to see you with me?
[40:21] Zara, its very late night
[40:25] go to sleep
