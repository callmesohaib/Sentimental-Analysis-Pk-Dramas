[00:12] I don't understand what they are getting by doing this.
[00:16] My daughter is here now, then why is she doing this?
[00:20] She's only doing this to save herself.
[00:23] So that no one can say, that she was a cruel mother-in-law
[00:27] The woman that came here, was here to take revenge.
[00:30] I cannot tell you how much she disrespected sister-in-law.
[00:34] Don't even let me get started on Zara. She exposed everything about her.
[00:38] Adnan has offered some advice.
[00:41] Really... what is that?
[00:45] About Zara's second marriage.
[00:49] What?
[00:56] Zara tell me what happened.
[01:00] What's the matter with you? Tell me what it is.
[01:13] Will you take me to Adeel's home?
[01:16] What?
[01:22] Did you call me here to ask this of me?
[01:25] What will you do there?
[01:27] I want to see uncle.
[01:29] I want to talk to him. He called mother.
[01:36] What was he saying?
[01:37] I don't know, mother didn't pick up. Mother should have talked to him.
[01:43] Lord knows what must have happened there.
[01:45] Zara, forget about them.
[01:49] If auntie didn't tell you then that means that auntie doesn't want you meeting them.
[01:54] They are blood relatives. Our relationship won't end so easily.
[01:58] What will you do there?
[02:01] I will ask him why he didn't trust me and didn't listen to me.
[02:06] That is nonsense. Do you think if you ask him he'll tell you?
[02:13] He won't tell you the reason he didn't trust you.
[02:14] Don't joke around. My wounds are still fresh.
[02:18] Then why are you causing yourself pain?
[02:24] Life is small.
[02:27] And who will know that better than you?
[02:31] Did we come into this world to provide people with explanations? Answer me!
[02:37] Why are you being angry at me?
[02:40] What else am I supposed to do?
[02:43] I explain things to you in a loving manner but you don't listen to me.
[02:48] Why are you causing pain to your family?
[02:52] Do you think it brings them joy seeing you like this?
[02:56] Answer me? Do you think seeing you like this brings them joy?
[03:00] Saad, I cannot change myself. I have to live with the difficulties that exist in my life.
[03:07] Losing hope is a sin.
[03:11] Seasons change.
[03:15] There is always light at the end of the tunnel.
[03:24] At least try, forget everything and move forwards.
[03:31] Will you take me to Adeel's home?
[03:41] Alright Saad, I'll go myself.
[03:57] If you try to go...
[04:01] then this is the end to our friendship.
[04:04] I will end this friendship.
[04:16] Saad...
Think about it.
[04:21] Am I important to you...
[04:24] or your stubborn demand.
[04:56] To me, you are very important.
[06:05] Mother, when are they coming?
[06:07] You're supposed to tell me that.
[06:09] Then I'll do as you say.
[06:11] I have no problem.
[06:13] Invite them tomorrow. Tomorrow is Sunday, and it wlll be easier for them.
[06:17] Yes, you are right.
[06:19] Alright fine... I'll call Fakhra and invite them.
[06:24] Greetings. Shall we?
[06:27] By God's good grace you look lovely. You should dress up like this often.
[06:31] Thank you auntie.
[06:33] Mother, don't wait for us. We'll be late today.
[06:36] Sure take your time. Don't worry about me.
[06:40] Maheen... it's late, cover your head.
[06:44] Sure alright. Farewell.
[06:48] Farewell
[07:21] I was on my way to you. I saw them together, I tried to tell you but you didn't listen.
[07:28] I told you not to leave Saad and Zara alone. Now Zara has taken your place.
[07:35] What are you saying?
[07:38] There is nothing like that.
[07:40] I saw them two smiling and talking to each other.
[07:44] What can I do if you want to ignore the facts?
[07:48] No... it cannot be like this.
[07:51] If it's nothing like that, then why are you crying?
[07:57] Do you think I won't know if you don't tell me?
[08:00] Whether someone sympathizes with you or not...
[08:04] I do and I understand your pain.
[08:10] I have some work in the kitchen...
[08:12] Wait and listen to me.
[08:17] If you don't start walking the path that you don't want to walk on...
[08:23] then someone else will. I admit that the path is difficult...
[08:29] then if you don't change your mind, then you will regret it.
[08:35] Hey!
[08:48] Both sisters are stubborn, they don't listen.
[08:53] Anyways... she'll listen.
[08:57] The arrow is heading towards it mark, it will strike soon enough.
[09:33] I've been looking for you and you're here.
[09:48] What are you thinking about?
[09:51] It's nothing...
[09:54] I've noted something, you've been ignoring me for a few days.
[10:03] I'm ignoring you?
[10:05] Yes you are. Whenever I come to visit, you sit down to study...
[10:10] When do you ever come here for me?
[10:14] You come here for Zara...
What are you saying Zaini?
[10:20] Before you didn't even come here, weeks used to pass...
[10:26] Zaini I had a new job, I was burdened by work.
[10:30] That's why I didn't come.
[10:33] You were burdened by work? Are you not anymore?
[10:39] You're upset with me, that's why you're saying this, right?
[10:42] No... I'm not upset with you...
[10:46] then why are you being so rude?
[10:49] I'm not being rude, leave, I have to make dinner.
[10:52] I'll help you... I'm an excellent chef...
[10:57] I don't want any help from you, leave.
[11:00] I will help you.
[11:06] Dolly...
[11:09] Yes?
[11:13] I'll be right there.
[11:20] I'll get going, mother is not feeling well.
[12:22] Father...
[12:24] Yes..
Get up and take your medicine.
[12:29] I don't want to... throw it away.
[12:34] Father, then how will you get better?
[12:39] What will I achieve...
[12:41] by getting better?
[12:50] Father... I cannot see you like this...
[12:56] Brother Adeel has left us...
[13:01] Do you want to leave us as well?
[13:05] My dear child...
[13:09] Enough father... now get up and take your medicine.
[13:14] Get up...
[14:18] I'm fine my dear...
[14:22] What's the matter with her? What did the doctor say?
[14:25] Her blood pressure increased, because of which she fainted.
[14:29] But thank God she's fine now.
[14:32] My dear, I'm alright, don't worry.
[14:34] Thank God that you guys came back on time.
[14:39] Nothing will happen to me.
[14:40] Mother, you don't take care of yourself.
[14:44] Auntie, what are you worried about?
[14:48] I'm not worried about anything.
[14:50] These things happen with time and age.
[14:53] This will continue for as long as I'm alive.
May God have mercy mother!
[14:57] Why are you worrying me stating such things?
[15:02] My dear, one day all of us have to leave.
[15:06] There's nothing big about that. For now, I'm fine.
[15:10] Why are you saying such things? You are worrying him for no reason as well.
[15:16] No auntie, this was my duty.
Thank you.
[15:21] You've stood by us.
[15:24] Will you thank me now as well?
[15:27] Your mother is like mine.
Yes my dear...
[15:30] Why not? You are my son.
[15:32] And thank God that I have such obedient children.
[15:36] Auntie, now rest... the doctor has asked you not to talk much.
[15:41] If you don't take care of yourself, then your blood pressure can shoot up.
[15:48] Dolly, take her inside.
[15:50] Sure... come mother.
Sure my dear. I'll go and rest.
[16:06] Saad left so early, didn't you stop him?
[16:10] Dolly called... maybe auntie is not well.
[16:14] Asfa is unwell. Why didn't you tell me? I could have gone with Saad.
[16:19] Mother, I wasn't sure. Saad didn't say anything to me.
[16:23] He left in a hurry. Brother Ali is there you can ask him.
[16:28] I'll call him.
Don't call, let's go.
[16:33] Brother Ali is here.
[16:36] Greetings*
What happened? How's sister now?
[16:41] She's better now.
What happened?
[16:44] Mother, her blood pressure increased and she fell in the bathroom.
[16:49] My God... she fell? Did she get hurt?
[16:52] No, she didn't get hurt. It's good I was passing by when Dolly called.
[16:59] There is nothing to worry about, right?
No there isn't.
[17:04] What should we do? Should we go right now?
[17:06] I think it would be better if we go tomorrow morning.
[17:19] I liked them a lot.
[17:22] What do you think?
I liked them as well.
[17:27] I pray that we get an approval from them.
[17:30] God willing, they will approve.
[17:33] I liked the guy a lot. He's educated and sober.
[17:46] Maheen...
[17:47] What's the matter? Didn't you like them?
[17:53] No auntie, if you guys like him, then it's fine.
[17:59] Still, you must have an opinion.
[18:04] Auntie, don't you think they were a little too demanding?
[18:09] What do you mean?
[18:12] I overheard Usama and auntie Fakhra talking...
[18:17] She was talking about a house.
[18:20] Maybe she's expecting that you guys will give them a house as a dowry.
[18:28] Usama...
[18:32] Why didn't you tell them?
[18:35] No... we didn't talk about anything like that.
[18:38] We were just generally discussing it.
[18:42] Yes but I think that it would be better if you guys talk about it openly, just once.
[18:48] We don't want to lose the opportunity to talk to them.
[18:52] Mother, don't worry. Let them answer.. I'll talk to them.
[19:10] How much more time will we keep Adnan here?
[19:16] What are you saying?
[19:21] Let's give this portion to someone else.
[19:25] What's wrong with them?
[19:28] They are not just tenants, rather they are our relatives.
[19:31] They are you like your aunt and uncle.
[19:33] They are not our blood relatives.
[19:41] This was our main app, we pitched this to Mercedes.
[19:45] On the front end we used word press, whereas in the back end we used Robulus.
[19:52] And sir, one more thing...
[19:56] This is the design we made and the client has approved it.
[20:03] And this is all the coding. That's it.
[20:08] Thank you sir.
[20:09] Well done Saad, we liked your presentation very much. Keep it up.
[20:18] Sir thank you so much for the opportunity.
You deserve this.
[20:23] Thank you... that's all for today.
Thank you sir.
[20:31] Saad... I didn't expect you would give such an amazing presentation.
[20:36] Very good...
Shall we?
[20:42] Please..
[20:51] Zaini... you're here? Didn't you go with mother and father?
[20:56] Why? Where was I supposed to go?
To visit auntie Asifa.
[21:02] No... I didn't want to go there...
[21:06] Alright.
[21:09] You should have gone if you wanted to go with mother and father.
[21:14] What would I do there?
Yes.
[21:18] What would you have done there? Saad wouldn't be home.
[21:23] He's at work.
[21:25] Yes, he had a meeting.
[21:27] He had a meeting... I didn't know about that.
[21:31] He must have forgotten, ask him. He will like that.
[21:36] When he thought it wasn't important enough to tell me,
[21:39] then there is no point in me asking.
[21:41] Zaini, I'm sure he forgot. I know he'll like it if you ask.
[21:44] Zara, I think I know what he likes...
[21:47] I'll talk to him later.
[21:49] You can call and ask him about his meeting.
[21:53] Are you alright Zaini? Is everything between you two?
[21:58] Yes it is.
[22:00] Why?
[22:02] Did Saad say something to you?
No...
[22:06] Saad didn't say anything. I was just asking.
[22:16] When are you exams starting from?
[22:19] Monday.
[22:21] Alright... show me what you're studying.
[22:28] Do you need help?
No, I don't need any help.
[22:32] I can do it on my own.
[22:35] Alright... fine...
I'm hungry...
[22:41] I'll bring you something to eat. You want some noodles?
[23:18] Hello
All the best.
[23:21] You remembered it was my paper.
[23:23] How can I forget? That's the reason I called.
[23:27] It's because I couldn't come.
[23:30] I'm happy that you remembered.
[23:37] Are you still upset?
[23:39] I wasn't upset before.
[23:42] Zaini, I miss you.
[23:45] You know how much I love you.
[23:47] Saad, I'm running late, I have to leave.
[23:51] You can go, but before you leave smile for me.
[23:56] How will you see me smile on a call. It's not like we're on a video call.
[24:01] I know that... but you are smiling, right?
[24:04] You are smiling... that's what I wanted.
[24:12] Okay... I'll get going now.
[24:15] And yes...
[24:17] thank you so much.
[24:18] Take care and do good on your paper.
[24:22] Farewell...
Bye... farewell.
[24:46] Bless you.
[24:52] Mother... I was thinking of finding a job.
[24:58] What need is there?
[25:01] No, there is no need.
[25:05] But, I feel anxious being at home.
[25:09] I start thinking of everything, even though I don't want to.
[25:15] I did my masters and I want to put by degree to use.
[25:22] But your father and I was thinking of something else for you.
[25:26] What were you thinking?
[25:30] We will tell you...
[25:32] but I'll ask your father on how we can make you busy.
[25:39] A job is all that has come to mind for now.
[25:44] Is the tea alright?
Yes it is.
[25:49] Greetings*
Adnan, where is Shaista?
[25:53] I thought she was downstairs with you.
[25:57] Maybe she needed something.
[26:07] Zara, how are you?
[26:16] I was passing by the kitchen and it smells amazing...
[26:22] I think you're cooking something special.
[26:25] Zara made all the food today...
It's settled then...
[26:28] I'll eat lunch with you guys today.
[26:32] Sure, why not? You are always welcome.
[26:36] Seeing that tea in your hand, is making me desirable for one as well.
[26:39] I'll bring one for you...
Sit down mother...
[26:43] I'll send it for you.
Not too sweet.
[26:48] Please have a seat.
[26:52] Where's Shaista if she's not here?
[26:59] Usama! Maheen! Come here you two!
[27:05] Yes auntie?
[27:07] Come sit with me... you too Usama...
[27:13] Savera, bring it...
[27:21] What's the matter? Is everything alright mother?
[27:24] Yes... let it come.
[27:29] Here we are.
[27:31] Have some sweetmeats.
[27:34] What is this for?
[27:38] They have taken a liking for Shela.
[27:42] Really... that's amazing!
[27:45] Really?
[27:48] Many congratulations.
To you as well.
[27:53] They are good people... she called me and said...
[27:58] that she against dowry.
[28:00] She also asked me to start preparing for the wedding.
[28:03] There is no need to do anything anymore...
Mother...
[28:08] what about that thing?
No my dear... they just mentioned it.
[28:13] You two should remove all doubt from your mind.
[28:16] They are you honorable people.
[28:19] I can't believe that we've found such a great family.
[28:23] That's how lucky my daughter is...
[28:28] I pray that...
[28:31] God protects my daughter's fate.
Amen.
[28:36] Did they say something else?
[28:40] They will be here on Saturday.
[28:44] Mother, propose an engagement to them.
[28:49] No my dear... there's no need. It's a needless expense.
[28:52] My sister is getting married. I want no shortage of anything.
[28:57] We'll have all the functions and we'll start with the engagements.
[29:01] Who will do it? It will be very expensive.
[29:05] Don't worry about it mother.
[29:07] Just invite them.
[29:11] Alright, as you wish.
[29:20] Pass the sweetmeat to Maheen.
[29:24] Will you not eat?
[29:35] How about you mother?
[29:37] Come in.
[29:42] What's the matter? What do you want to talk about?
[29:46] I want to discuss something important.
What is it?
[29:50] How long will we keep..
[29:53] auntie Shaista and uncle Adnan in this house?
[29:56] Huh? What are you saying?
[30:04] We should give rent out this portion to someone else.
[30:07] What's wrong with them? They are not just tenants...
[30:12] they are our relative. They are your aunt and uncle.
[30:15] They are not blood relatives.
[30:21] They are more than that to me.
[30:23] Why don't you understand?
[30:25] What's there to understand?
[30:27] Maheen said such things. She always spoke against them, not you. What's gotten into you?
[30:33] Sit down, I'll explain it to you.
[30:36] I will not... because it makes no sense.
[30:39] Remove it from your head.
[30:42] As long as your father doesn't want them to leave, no one can remove them from here.
[30:49] Mother!
[31:14] What's the matter? Why the long face?
[31:18] We won't stay here anymore.
[31:21] What's wrong with you? What are you saying?
[31:24] No one's happy that we're here.
[31:27] Did someone say something?
No, but I just overheard...
[31:32] What did you hear?
Zara told sister that we should leave.
[31:38] Zara... what else did she say?
She said that...
[31:57] I think you have it wrong... Zara cannot say that.
[32:02] No brother, I overheard her talking to sister
[32:07] Sister tell him... tell what Zara said to you.
[32:12] Is what she saying true?
[32:21] Yes...
[32:28] You know very well...
[32:32] what she's going through. I can't even say anything to her.
[32:38] I can only apologize...
[32:40] Brother, why are you apologizing to us?
[32:44] You are our elder... you have done us a lot of favors.
[32:49] Don't do this.
[32:51] Shaista is right... you are embarrassing us.
[32:56] We know that Zara is mentally stressed.
[33:02] And we didn't come here to complain, rather we came here to tell you...
[33:09] that we have never tried to take advantage of you. 
[33:12] Because of our poverty and unemployment....
[33:16] we are forced to live in this house of yours.
[33:20] Adnan, you have always stood by me like a little brother.
[33:26] I know that you have no ill intentions...
[33:30] Brother, it is because of this trust I talked to you that day openly...
[33:37] But you didn't answer me, so I thought you didn't like my advice.
[33:43]  That's why I didn't say anything.
[33:45] It's not like that. Sarwat and I thought about it.
[33:51] We think that right now isn't a good time.
[33:55] What are you talking about?
[34:00] About Zara's wedding. Adnan was the one who advised it.
[34:04] What?
[34:07] You guys want to get Zara married again?
[34:11] So soon?
No...
[34:16] not so soon but...
[34:19] But it doesn't hurt to think about it, especially if we find a good match.
[34:24] Sister, don't worry. I'm here to find a good proposal for Zara.
[34:32] No.
[34:34] No need for that. Let me talk to Zara first,
[34:38]  because she doesn't like you living here.
[34:42] If she finds out that this is your idea...
[34:45] then she will never agree to it.
[34:51] Besides she could never given Adeel's place to anyone.
[34:56] Zara.
[35:01] My dear come...
[35:11] I wanted to talk to you father.
Sure...
[35:16] I was thinking of finding a job...
Job?
[35:22] Yes.
[35:24] But... we were talking about your wedding here.
