[00:12] I am unable to understand that how do I compose myself
[00:17] I am unable to understand anything. 
[00:20] You are not alone. We are with you.
[00:24] Are you both sisters mad?
[00:27] are you both sisters crazy!
[00:29] Sometime one sister asks me to leave her and other day other sister asks me to leave her.
[00:33] What do you both want? 
[00:34] Saad 
It's enough.
[00:39] the one you are asking about, her name was Jamila. 
[00:42] Yes Jamila
[00:44] She has disappeared from here immediately. 
[00:46] So many people are coming and asking about her. I think she has done some fraud.
[01:04] what have I done!
[01:08] Jamila you haven't done good with me, I won't spare you
[01:13] I will ruin you!
[03:06] Zaini
[03:09] dad, you could have called me if you had some work with me
[03:14] its ok
[03:16] I came here
[03:19] you didn't stopped there
[03:22] actually I was so tired that's why, also I had loads of work in the office today
[03:31] sometimes, the situation in a person's life make that person go tired
[03:37] I know
[03:40] you are upset because of Zara
[03:47] and you had to do such a big compromise in your life because of me
[03:55] shall I say something, dear?
[03:59] the parents are like a very weak & helpless tree
[04:09] if their roots become a little weaker, then the flowers blooming on them gets withered away
[04:18] even parents are like that
[04:22] they gets finished within inside, if any one of their child goes away from them
[04:33] anyways, I am not such a selfish father that... 
[04:37] I shall hurt my daughter for my own happiness
[04:43] I won't force you
[04:47] in fact, I will ask Zara not to come here again
[04:51] No dad
[04:53] please don't say anything to her
[04:56] please don't stop her for coming here
[04:59] if she wants to meet you & mom, she can
[05:05] I have already done compromise with my life
[05:10] I will try to forget everything
[05:15] its just that I want some time
[05:20] I am proud of you, dear
[05:28] you are also very important to me, like my other children
[05:33] and until I am alive
[05:37] never consider yourself alone
[05:56] here... 
[05:57] drink your tea
[06:00] mom, why you've brought it?
[06:02] where is Zara?
[06:04] you had dropped her in the morning, have you forgotten?
[06:07] brother Manzoor wasn't well
[06:10] didn't she come as of yet?
[06:13] She has gone there after so many days, she might have stayed there
[06:17] call & ask her
[06:19] No mom
[06:20] why shall I call her, if she didn't call to inform me
[06:25] and she has gone to her father's house
[06:27] she will come back whenever she feels like
[06:29] what's wrong with you, dear?
[06:31] did you guys had fought on something?
[06:35] there isn't any such thing, mom
[06:37] then why are you spoiling your mood so much?
[06:39] mom, I am just tensed about my office. I am going inside to rest
[06:44] at least drink your tea
I don't want to
[06:51] the limit... 
[06:54] don't know what is happening with this boy!
[07:21] here comes your piping hot tea
[07:23] oh dear, you are doing my work since morning. You must be tired by now
[07:27] its ok dad, I like to do your work
[07:31] let me do them
[07:34] Okay
[07:37] didn't Saad come to pick you?
[07:42] I will go myself, dad
[07:51] are you happy with Saad?
[07:58] I don't know
[08:01] what do you mean by that?
But you both were... 
[08:07] dad, you used to say... 
[08:10] all that glitters is not gold
[08:14] the same way, its not necessary for every person who looks happy to be happy from within
[08:22] but both of you were... 
[08:26] then what was all that?
[08:29] compromise... 
[08:35] anyways, leave this topic
[08:37] you have forgiven me, dad
[08:40] its enough for me, I don't need anything else
[08:46] but I was thinking that you & Saad...
[08:49] leave it dad
[08:51] please dad, don't say anything
[08:56] whatever happened with me
[09:00] there wasn't any fault of yours in it
[09:03] there wasn't any fault of anyone in it
[09:11] maybe, there are so many trials in my fate
[09:19] dad, I must leave now as its getting late
[09:23] let me ask brother, he might drop me
[09:26] let me go & ask him
[09:58] brother... 
[10:00] won't you talk to me?
[10:06] please forgive me by considering it as my mistake
[10:10] even mom & dad have forgiven me
[10:13] you also forgive me please
[10:15] this is the elegance of parents
[10:19] that they forgive all the mistakes of their children & hug them
[10:23] and Zaini... 
[10:25] Zaini was helpless, what else she could do?
[10:34] but I am not helpless
[10:44] isn't Zara happy with Saad?
[10:49] if not then what was all that we saw?
[10:55] were Saad & Zara telling the truth?
[10:59] wasn't there any such thing between them?
[11:05] if its true then, what have I done?
[11:12] Zara's eyes cannot lie
[11:16] today, I saw the truth in my daughter's eyes
[11:21] how I couldn't read my daughter's eyes at that time?
[11:29] oh God... 
[11:31] what is truth or lie, I don't know
[11:37] but I want to see my daughters happy
[11:44] a helpless father can only wish for this
[11:50] make my daughters life easier, my Lord.. 
[11:57] make it easier for them
[12:35] you came back?
[12:38] I thought, you won't come
[12:46] who came to drop you?
[12:49] I came with brother Ali
[12:53] how is everyone at home?
[12:55] everyone's complaints would have been lessened by now
[13:03] when will you go back?
[13:08] Soon
[13:11] shall I serve dinner for you?
[13:14] I am already full
[13:35] why he doesn't want to eat the dinner? Did he tell you?
[13:39] he is not hungry
[13:42] he is sitting furiously since he came back home
[13:46] he might have some office stress
[13:49] don't worry, shall I give you some more curry or flat bread?
[13:52] No dear, you eat. I will take it myself
[13:56] so tell me, how is brother Manzoor? How is he feeling now?
[14:02] the doctor is saying its a viral, so it will take a few more days
[14:06] may God have mercy
[14:08] dear, you could have stayed there for a few more days. We would have loved it too
[14:13] but you would have become lonely
[14:14] what about me, I could have managed
[14:18] even Saad came back, but anyways its ok
[14:23] do go to stay there after a few days
[14:55] Saad
[14:58] actually I was thinking that... 
[15:13] switch off the light, I am feeling sleepy
[15:40] Adnan
[15:44] Adnan... 
[15:52] you!
[15:55] when did you come?
[15:58] I have never left though
[16:00] what do you mean by that?
[16:02] I have killed you with my own hands, then how can you come back?
[16:08] to take my revenge
[16:10] you cannot take revenge from me
[16:12] you cannot harm me at all. I won't let you do anything
[16:17] Adnan, I will do it
[16:20] you have killed me
[16:24] now you have to die as well
[16:26] you cannot kill me
[16:29] you cannot kill me!
[16:31] nobody can save you from me
[16:36] you have to die
[16:39] Adnan, you have to die
[16:44] you have to die
[16:48] you have to die
[16:50] you have to die for sure
[16:53] you have to die
[16:56] you have to die today...
[17:55] sister
[17:56] yes
[17:57] you haven't slept as of yet?
[17:59] I wanted to say something to you
[18:06] I want to say "thanks" to you
[18:11] because you took my side in front of mom
[18:15] I had heard you talking to her
[18:18] you haven't stopped your habit of eavesdropping till date
[18:22] sister, you can scold me & say whatever you want to. But don't be quiet like this
[18:28] you don't look good in this way
[18:29] everyone showing pity on me
[18:33] why?
[18:35] for what?
[18:37] there isn't any such thing, I was just asking you casually that...
[18:41] has something happened, that you are upset?
[18:43] No
[18:46] did you had some issue with brother Fahad?
[18:49] No
[18:51] did your friend said something?
[18:54] No
[18:56] I am not friends with her anymore
[18:59] why?
[19:03] You were right. The friendship among middle class & rich people doesn't lasts for long
[19:10] So just like that
[19:12] I have ended it
[19:18] Okay, I am going to make coffee so tell me would you like to drink some?
[19:22] I don't feel like drinking it, I want to sleep
[19:24] go
[20:14] how do you find the pictures?
[20:17] if you like them then tell me, I have a few more
[20:20] shall I send them?
[20:21] why are you doing this to me? 
What wrong have I done with you?
[20:25] its your delusion
[20:28] nobody could harm Fahad till date
[20:30] See, I beg you. Please delete all of my pictures
[20:35] yeah, right!
[20:37] what do you want from me?
[20:39] Ok lets do one deal
[20:41] you agree with me
[20:43] and I will agree with whatever you are saying
[20:46] what kind of a deal?
[20:47] give me 5 lac rupees
[20:50] I will delete your photos
[20:52] 5 lacs!
[20:55] from where I will bring it? I don't have such a hefty amount
[20:58] what shall I do then? Bring it from anywhere
[21:01] if you want me to leave you so easily, then you have to give me such a small amount
[21:08] Fahad, please don't do this to me
[21:10] I haven't done anything as of yet
[21:12] yes, if you won't give me the money then I will think what needs to be done with you
[21:17] in fact, let me tell you right now
[21:21] I will send these photos to your respectable father
[21:28] your marriage had been called off twice before this as well, right?
[21:32] but you haven't told this to me
[21:33] Fahad...
[21:35] just think
[21:38] what will happen to your father, if he sees these pictures?
[21:44] he will die..
[21:52] no Fahad please don't say this. Don't do any such thing
[21:56] you have only 2 days time
[21:59] if I didn't get 5 lac rupees within 2 days then...
[22:03] you know what I can do
[22:06] Fahad!
[22:32] Ok do you breakfast, I am leaving
[22:34] Where are you going?
[22:38] you came here after so many days
[22:42] do you remember, we used to be really good friends. We used to meet a lot, now we hardly get any time to meet
[22:49] I am completely alone here
[22:51] do come over, whenever you feel like
[23:20] hello Fahad, please don't hang up. Just listen to me once
[23:24] Please, I beg you. Don't do this Fahad
[23:27] hello!
Fahad?
[23:29] hello!
[24:02] Mirha...
[24:04] what's the matter, you are not going to the university nowadays
[24:08] dad, actually there is a cultural week celebrations at the university that's why I am not going
[24:13] dear, then you should go there for sure
[24:16] see, you should know the culture of our country and then...
[24:22] there are so many colors in our culture
[24:26] which are tied by a single thread
[24:29] and they make our country beautiful
[24:32] and when I was of your age, then I & your aunt...
[24:41] dear, there is a file in my room namely HMD. Please bring it
[24:50] Okay
[24:55] yes! I was telling you that you should go
[24:59] as it is, you will miss out all of these things once you go abroad
[25:06] right?
[25:08] yes dad
[26:03] Saad
[26:06] Saad, at least listen to me. 
Why aren't you talking to me?
[26:09] what's your problem, Saad?
[26:12] why aren't you understanding my point, Saad? 
Let me try doing it once
[26:16] Zara, I am getting late
[26:19] don't talk rubbish to me
[26:20] Rubbish! Do you find my words rubbish, Saad?
[26:24] yes, I do
[26:26] go inside, otherwise mom will hear us
[26:28] I am not going anywhere, nor you are
[26:30] I want to talk to you about it, and I won't go anywhere until you answer me
[26:35] I have already answered you, Zara
[26:37] Saad, it was a lie
[26:38] only that was the truth, Zara
[26:40] why are you doing one foolishness after another, Saad?
[26:43] until when you'll keep suffering?
[26:46] I have decided, & you have to agree with me
[26:50] Since you have decided already, then why are you asking me?
[26:53] what's the matter? Why are you guys arguing so early morning?
[26:57] Nothing aunty, we need to bring some groceries
[27:01] so I was telling Saad to take me to the market
[27:03] but he doesn't listen to me
[27:06] Saad, why aren't you listening to her?
[27:09] she is right
[27:11] mom, I am getting late as I have to go to office. Bye!
[27:14] Saad...

[27:56] Look, earlier Shaista used to do all of my work & now I have become dependent on you guys
[28:02] what are you saying, Adnan uncle? You aren't any stranger for us
[28:07] everyone's love & affection is my only support of living
[28:12] Ok do you breakfast, I am leaving
[28:14] where are you going?
[28:19] you came here after so many days
[28:22] do you remember, we used to be really good friends. We used to meet a lot, now we hardly get any time to meet
[28:29] I am completely alone here

[30:04] from where I will bring 5 lacs? I don't have it
[30:10] what shall I do?
[30:12] if you want me to leave you so easily, then you have to give me such a small amount
[30:19] I will send these photos to your respectable father
[30:23] your marriage had been called off twice before this as well, right?
[30:27] just think
[30:30] what will happen to your father, if he sees these pictures?
[30:48] what have I done!

[30:53] what will I do now? From where I shall bring the money?
[30:57] why is this happening with me?
[31:00] why?
[31:01] are you asking this, Mahi?
[31:11] who are you?
[31:12] I?
[31:14] I am you!
[31:16] your inner voice
[31:17] who are you, and what do you want from me?
[31:20] I have come to show you the mirror, Mahi
[31:25] today, you are experiencing the same thing that you did with Zara
[31:29] do you remember?
[31:31] how she was crying
[31:34] and pleading in front of you, that don't do this cruelty with her
[31:39] but you didn't listen to her at all
[31:42] you had insulted her, humiliated her & defamed her in front of everyone
[31:48] you had ousted her from this house
[31:54] the same thing is happening with you now, Mahi
[31:57] whatever you did with Zara few months ago
[32:06] No
[32:07] it is like that
[32:09] you did it all!
[32:12] you will be treated in the same manner, Mahi
[32:15] you have to leave this house as well
[32:17] No no no... I have done nothing!
[32:20] you will pushed out & ousted from this house
[32:23] you deserve this!
[32:25] I haven't done anything with Zara
[32:27] I haven't done anything, nobody will oust me from here. I have done nothing!
[32:32] I haven't done anything..
[32:39] No... its my parents house
[32:43] they won't oust me
[32:46] this is my house
[32:49] I haven't done anything
[32:52] I haven't done anything at all
[33:11] what is happening to me?
[33:13] why am I fighting with Zara?
[33:17] what is happening to me?
[33:19] why am I feeling bad when Zara is going away from me?
[33:24] I always wanted to fix everything
[33:26] Zaini shall end her anger with me, then...
[33:30] and when she wants to fix everything today, then why my heart isn't agreeing with her?
[33:35] why I am not liking Zara's decision of going away from me?
[33:38] Why?
[33:40] why am I feeling afraid?
[33:44] am I in love with Zara?
[33:47] No, how is this possible?
[33:49] Zara is my friend & she also considers me her friend
[33:53] then?
[33:54] then what is this?
[33:57] what is this feeling?
[33:59] why I am not understanding anything?
[34:17] please have a seat
[34:20] doctor, is everything fine? Is there anything to worry?
[34:25] why she was feeling dizzy?
