[00:15] This is the file of Zara's new house's documents.
[00:18] Dad has decided that Zara will live in this new house with me after our marriage.
[00:24] First that cursed Zara snatched my son from me.
[00:29] And now she will get ownership of this property.
[00:33] And despite all that you think that she is innocent, how surprising.
[00:37] He has given you this house, not me.
[00:40] You know it very well that why has he done that.
[00:43] Yes.
[00:45] So that this cruel world get away from two lovers.
[00:49] So he solved that problem.
[00:52] Do problems solve in this way?
[00:54] Problems don't solve like this, in fact problems will increase if we will shift to new house.
[01:05] Mr. Ahmed, are you sleeping?
[01:09] Yes I am sleeping and I am habitual of responding while I am asleep.
[01:13] What's wrong with you?
Why do you keep taunting me all the time?
[01:16] I want to discuss something very important that's why I was asking.
[01:20] If you want to discuss something important then do that.
[01:23] I will talk to you if you will get up.
[01:28] OK, I am awake. Now what's up.
[01:32] I dreamed last night.
[01:36] Hmm.
[01:37] Really? You dreamed at night.
[01:41] By the way, normally we dream at night.
[01:45] What's wrong with you Mr. Ahmed?
[01:47] I am serious.
[01:50] I dreamed that you and me are going to Karachi
[01:55] and do you know that why we are going there?
[01:56] Both of us are taking Adeel procession for Zara to Karachi.
Really?
[02:01] Then what happened?
[02:03] Then the scene got changed
[02:05] And I saw Zara in bridal dress.
[02:08] And I am putting money in her hands.
Really?
[02:15] And what happened next?
Well.
[02:19] My dream finished. Dreams are not that long.
[02:23] Just a small dream.
[02:27] By the way Mrs Farida, didn't that dream deliver at wrong address?
[02:35] What happened to you, you are talking strangely.
[02:38] Now, I have realized my mistake.
[02:42] Whatever misunderstanding is there between me and Sarwat,
[02:45] our children shouldn't suffer because of that. I have realized that.
[02:52] I have understood that Zara and Adeel are destined to live together.
[02:57] Take me to Karachi as soon as possible.
[02:59] I want to fix Zara's marriage date by going there and I want to finalize all matters by myself.
[03:09] And what do you mean by all matters?
[03:13] Let me tell you one thing Mrs. Farida.
[03:16] The plot which I have given to Zara
[03:19] I am not ready to change my decision for that.
[03:23] Why are you mentioning that plot here.
[03:26] I am not asking you to give that back to me.
[03:28] When I have given my only son to her then that plot has no worth in front of that.
[03:34] Yes, you are right.
[03:36] But, I don't know why, I am in a doubt.
[03:41] Are you Farida? I mean how did your thoughts change so quickly?
[03:49] It's the limit.
[03:51] Get ready, I want to go to Karachi. Right?
[03:58] Oh my God.
[04:01] I don't know, from which direction son has risen today.
[04:05] Oh God.
[04:08] Oh.
[04:12] Mrs. Sarwat.
[04:14] Greetings, are you back?
No, it's just my shadow.
[04:20] Bring water for me, it's very hot outside.
[04:22] Yes, I am bringing.
[04:27] Who is calling?
[04:29] OK. Greetings.
[04:34] Yes.
[04:36] OK, come in the evening.
[04:38] OK, if God wills. Greetings.
[04:43] Why did you ask me to bring sweets?
[04:48] I asked Shaista to do Istikhara for Zara and Adeel so she did that for me.
[04:55] She told me that the answer is in affirmative.
[04:57] That's great.
[05:00] Then everything will be alright, if God wills.
If God wills.
[05:04] Did you talk to brother Ahmed?
[05:07] Yes, I talk to him and he also wants to fix marriage date as soon as possible.
[05:13] And what is the opinion of sister-in-law about it?
[05:17] I didn't feel appropriate to ask about that.
[05:21] Adeel is here so ask our daughters specially Maheen
[05:26] that she shouldn't say any such thing which will hurt Adeel.
[05:28] Yes, I will tell her.
[05:32] And what about my white dress, is that ready, tomorrow is Friday.
[05:37] Yes, I will press that.
[05:39] Listen
[05:41] Aren't you forgetting anything?
[05:44] Oh, I forgot it.
[05:47] Let me distribute the sweets. I will give to Shaista first.
[05:51] She has done a great favor on me.
[05:53] O God, keep my daughters happy in the lives.
[06:02] What if Adeel changes after marriage then?
[06:05] Maheen has taught you all these things. Right?
[06:08] I admit that it's Maheen's fear
[06:09] but when she said this to me then I also felt that this may happen.
[06:14] What will you do if Adeel will say to you like normal boys
[06:17] that it's a matter between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law?
[06:20] Saad, are you my friend or an enemy?
[06:22] Why are you scaring me by saying such things?
[06:24] And what's wrong with all of you? Why are you saying such weird things.
[06:28] Even weird things have answers.
[06:30] Answer my question.
[06:32] What is the guarantee that Adeel will love you in the same way after marriage like he loves you now.
[06:44] I don't have any answer to this question.
That's the problem.
[06:48] Both Maheen and Zenny are saying the same thing.
[06:52] Adeel has given you a house.
[06:54] What if he will arrange a house here?
[06:57] Saad, it was not my condition to arrange a separate house.
[07:00] Uncle and Adeel have made this decision.
[07:02] Dad asked me about my consent.
[07:05] I have left all my decisions on my dad and mom because they can decide better for me.
[07:11] Your dad has forgotten his humiliation because of your love.
[07:16] Remember it.
[07:21] And I am advising you one last time being your friend.
[07:25] You should talk to Adeel and ask him to bring his parents here before uncle may fix your marriage date.
[07:33] Aunt Farida and Maham should apologize for their harsh behavior.
[07:38] It has happened earlier and it will happen in future as well.
[07:42] Is this your thinking Saad?
[07:44] You just say that it's very cheap thinking. I will feel happy if they will apologize.
[07:50] And if I am talking childishly then ask Adeel to talk sensibly.
[07:56] But why would you ask him, didn't he think himself about it?
[08:02] I have thought about it Saad. I have thought about it.
[08:14] You are right.
[08:17] You know what
[08:23] My Zara is very lucky
[08:26] that she has got a very caring friend like you.
[08:34] If you are Zara's friend that you are my friend as well. Right?
[08:41] So this friend wants to tell you
[08:45] that mom has forbidden me to talk about marriage.
[08:55] Now I won't talk about that.
[08:59] Because mom is coming here.
[09:06] To fix our marriage date.
[09:11] I promise you
[09:14] I will keep your friend very happy.
[09:17] I will take very good care of her.
[09:30] In fact I was just...
Just leave it dude.
[09:35] Accept my friendship. Hug me.
[09:57] I promise you
[10:02] I won't let any tear come in Zara's eyes.
[10:36] Are you ready?
Yes.
[10:38] Take it, you may need this.
[10:41] What is this Mahi?
[10:43] Keep it with you.
[10:44] I won't give her anything.
[10:46] You won't give her but you know the mentality of dad. Right?
[10:49] He will definitely give something to her so take it.
[10:54] I am unable to understand your thinking Mahi.
[10:57] You know that I am going there with a heavy heart but you...
[11:00] Lower your voice, if dad will listen then a fuss will be created here.
[11:03] Only because of him, I am doing this and bowing down in front of that girl.
[11:09] After few days, you will dominate and she will...
[11:11] Are you ready? Shall we go.
[11:13] Yes, I am ready.
[11:17] I want to take some gifts for your daughter-in-law.
[11:22] What? Is she your mom, I mean my wife?
[11:32] Yes, she is my mother and your wife.
[11:36] If both of you have finished your joke then we must leave.
[11:39] My child, I also wanted to take you there with me but it's obvious.
[11:44] Yes dad, but as you know that Mirha will be left alone.
[11:48] My child, take care of yourself.
OK.
[11:51] Mahi, be very careful.
[11:54] Don't open gate for any stranger as you know that condition of city is very bad.
[11:58] I won't open the gate and take very good care of Mirha and myself.
[12:03] OK take care.
OK dad, good bye.
[12:10] Good bye.
Let me lock the door.
[12:58] Greetings.
Greetings.
[13:03] I knew that my brother will definitely come.
[13:07] I was so sure and you didn't break my trust.
[13:11] OK be careful, my dress will spoil and there will be slits on it.
[13:17] Take care of your daughter's in-laws. Let me dress up well.
[13:21] Sarwat meet me as well, I have also come with your brother.
[13:44] Greetings.
Greetings, how are you?
[13:47] I am fine, how about you?
[13:49] Didn't sister Maham come with you?
[13:52] She should have come as well.
Yes she should have come
[13:55] But she had to take care of Mirha so we have left her at home.
[13:59] I insisted so much that let's go together, that will be great fun.
[14:03] But what can we do because Mirha is not feeling well.
[14:07] So Mahi won't be able to participate in brother's happiness because of Mirha. It's so sad.
[14:14] When I asked her that let's go together and hire an ambulance for Mirha
[14:19] then do you know what did your uncle say?
[14:21] He said that it doesn't make any difference.
[14:26] Maheen, won't let us feel that Mahi is not here.
[14:30] By the way, where is Maheen?
[14:33] She is making tea for you. Let's go in.
[14:36] Yes, we will go in but first let me meet with my daughter-in-law.
[14:44] Always keep happy.
Let's go.
[14:48] Greetings brother.
[15:01] How was your travel? Didn't you get bothered?
[15:05] The journey has just started.
[15:09] Let's see.
[15:11] I mean, I didn't feel that so much time has passed.
[15:16] But I was so eager to come here quickly because I want to meet my daughter-in-law as soon as possible.
[15:24] Now, you shouldn't delay.
[15:30] I have chosen 28th of this month. It will be Saturday.
[15:36] My Adeel was borne on Saturday as well.
[15:43] OK, if you have chosen that date then it's OK.
[15:46] Hold on brother, I won't talk about marriage.
[15:52] First we should clear our hearts and minds.
[15:56] Let's remove all grievances.
[15:59] And we will make a decision.
[16:00] After that we will discuss about marriage.
[16:13] Are you crazy Aqib?
[16:15] You are talking childishly. How can I come downstairs?
[16:19] And I asked you to send that through someone else, why have you come here yourself?
[16:24] But you said that it's been three/four days.
[16:28] You wanted to get your phone back.
[16:30] So I thought that I will give your phone back and will meet with you as well.
[16:34] Aqib I didn't say that you should come here yourself.
[16:37] I asked you to give them money to speed up the recovery.
Really?
[16:42] So you are only concerned about your phone not about me.
[16:46] I wanted to see you.
[16:48] I was so worried for you.
OK, just go from here.
[16:52] I will ask Sadaf to collect phone from you and then she will give that to me.
[16:57] Mirha, I am not going.
[16:59] I want to meet you. That's it.
That's so cheap Aqib.
[17:02] As you know that I...
You are calling me cheap.
[17:05] I am here to meet you but you are calling me cheap.
[17:11] OK, don't be angry.
[17:14] I was not calling you cheap.
[17:16] OK, let me do something.
[17:18] Let me try to come to the door.
[17:20] You don't need to come to the door.
[17:22] Ask your family members that Sadaf's brother has come to give me notes,
[17:24] no one will doubt because I have some books with me.
[17:26] There is no one at home. I am all alone.
[17:29] And my family members know Sadaf's family members.
Why?
[17:34] Where are you family members?
I am coming to the door.
[17:38] Let me try to come down.
[17:41] And you will only have two minutes for this meeting and then you will leave.
[17:44] Bye.
[18:11] I would like to request all of you to forgive me.
[18:16] I am really embarrassed that I made a big mistake.
[18:19] Farida, what are you doing?
[18:22] Put your hands down and keep quiet. Let me talk to them.
[18:27] What are you doing Mr. Ahmed?
[18:30] Let me do what I am doing?
[18:34] Humans make mistakes and I have made that mistake so I should apologize.
[18:41] No sister, you said that so just think that nothing has happened.
[18:46] That's it. Don't do this again. Take tea.
[18:51] Actually, I want to clear all grievances.
[18:56] I have made a mistake and I apologize to all of you for that.
[19:02] Brother.
[19:05] Specially you forgive me.
[19:09] I apologize to you that I did that foolish act.
[19:16] Sister, apology doesn't degrade anyone.
[19:20] But I think, it's not needed now.
[19:24] It's needed brother. It's needed.
[19:27] Why is this not needed?
[19:29] Just say it once that you have forgiven me. I will feel relax.
[19:35] Otherwise, I am openly saying
[19:40] that if you won't do that then I won't accept Zara as my daughter-in-law.
[19:50] I will treat her as my daughter always.
Why aunt?
[19:57] Do daughters have respect only, not daughters-in-law?
[20:00] Daughters-in-law also have their worth.
[20:02] We only want you to treat Zara well being a good mother-in-law. That's it.
[20:11] What's wrong with you Maheen?
[20:13] Elders are discussing so you don't have to interfere.
[20:18] No, no Sarwat.
[20:20] Let her speak, she is angry so let her express her anger.
[20:25] By doing that our heart becomes light and clear. No problem my child.
[20:35] Brother, just leave it and forgive her if she is insisting you.
[20:41] No brother, it's not needed.
[20:44] Please stop sister, how much more will you embarrass us?
[20:48] You are our guest and honorable for us.
[20:53] OK then, the matter is resolved.
[20:56] All grievances have been cleared. Many congratulations to all of you.
[21:01] So what are you saying that you have chosen 28th of this month?
[21:05] Hmm
[21:07] Yes, I was saying that.
[21:10] But first both our families will sit together.
[21:16] We will talk to each other and fix marriage date.
[21:20] And then we will inform you.
[21:23] Please take tea.
Hmm.
[21:28] Zara.
[21:29] Why are you standing there? Come to me and sit here with me, come my child.
[21:40] May you get my life.
Take tea.
[21:52] Mr. Manzoor, I made a very big mistake.
[21:57] She was doing absolutely like this.
Please forgive me.
[22:04] I will treat Zara as my daughter not as a daughter-in-law.
[23:01] Hello, Aqib I have opened the door from inside but It's not opening.
[23:05] You push it from outside and come in.
[23:07] What do you mean? Are you at the door?
[23:08] What do you mean? Are you not outside?
[23:11] I was just joking, how can I come at this time?
[23:14] Aqib, I have come down with my broken leg on this wheel chair just to open door for you.
[23:18] What's this joke?
OK, sorry.
[23:21] Sorry, I was just joking.
[23:25] Now, there is no need to talk to me. Bye.
[23:30] Grab her.
[23:33] Take her in.
[23:34] Who are you?
Keep quiet.
[23:49] Come in.
[23:51] Don't move.
[23:54] Stop it here. Go in.
[23:58] Come here.
[24:01] Don't move.
[24:32] Hurry up.
[24:39] Where is everything?
Upstairs.
[24:42] Bring that quickly.
[24:59] As I told you that there will no problem and mom will be convinced.
[25:06] But Adeel, I don't like this.
[25:11] What do you mean Zara?
[25:14] Aunt's apology in front of everyone like this.
[25:19] Aunt Shaista and uncle Adnan were also there.
[25:22] This is not good Adeel.
[25:25] Yes, by the way, I didn't like that as well.
[25:31] I shouldn't have talked to you.
[25:37] Which one?
[25:38] That I felt bad that dad was humiliated there.
[25:41] If I didn't tell you then you wouldn't have come here.
[25:45] And all of this wouldn't happen.
[25:48] Zara why are you thinking that much.
[25:51] That was mom's mistake so she apologized. It's simple.
[25:54] It's not that simple Adeel.
[25:56] I do respect aunt so much.
[25:59] As much as I have felt bad for dad in the same way I am feeling bad for aunt as well.
[26:04] She is our elder but she was apologizing to everyone.
[26:09] It's insulting for all of us.
[26:12] This shouldn't have happened Adeel.
[26:15] All of this happened because of me.
[26:17] Neither I had told you nor all of this would happen.
[26:23] It means that you will hide things from me after marriage.
[26:25] I didn't say that Adeel.
[26:27] You are not saying that but I am saying this.
[26:35] Zara never hide anything from me.
[26:38] Share everything with me that what do you think and what do you feel right and wrong
[26:45] so that I can take care of you.
[26:47] I share everything with you Adeel.
[26:49] Yes, but you are regretting as well.
[26:52] And you will hide such matters from me in future.
[26:57] Listen Zara.
[27:00] Our relation is not like that we talk to each other in a scary mood.
[27:05] Fear and love can't move on together.
[27:09] Please never do this.
[27:15] OK, I won't do this.
[27:20] No matter, how bad the situation maybe
[27:23] Our relation should never become weak. Right?
[27:31] Please go and sit with everyone.
[27:50] Give me quickly.
Leave us.
[28:21] You are sitting so comfortably.
Hmm?
[28:24] Are you happy with that insult?
[28:27] When I told you then you didn't understand my point.
[28:29] Now you are sitting quietly when Zara's mother-in-law has humiliated you. Do you understand?
[28:35] There is no such thing the way you are thinking.
[28:39] If she has said anything to me 
[28:41] then she was apologizing in front of brother Manzoor, that was her real worth.
[28:45] Oh I see.
[28:47] Well.
[28:50] She was apologizing in front of brother Manzoor.
[28:55] Look at me.
[28:57] I am also apologizing in front of you. Please forgive me.
[28:59]  Now can you tell me, what is in my heart?
[29:03] Only God knows what's inside anyone's heart. How do I know about that?
[29:08] Yes you are right. Only God knows that.
[29:12] But what is inside a person's heart is clearly visible on his face.
[29:16] And I have seen that thing on Mrs. Farida's face.
[29:19] She is getting ready to take revenge from Zara. So Zara should be careful.
[29:24] Her love with her husband and all misconceptions will be removed
[29:29]  and very bad will happen to this family and Zara.
[29:33] And I will feel happy about that.
[29:38] Fear God Adnan.
[29:41] How do you talk such things?
[29:45] God forbid, if anything like that may happen to Zara.
[29:47] Look at your face in mirror. I told you
[29:50] What is in a person's heart is clearly evident on his face.
[29:54] So it's clearly evident from your face that you have no pain, worry or concern about this matter.
[30:00] You are just saying this as a formality.
[30:04] If anything bad will happen to this family and Zara then you won't mind that at all. Right?
[30:15] Please forgive me.
[30:18] Oh God, what do I do to him?
[30:35] What was the need to create that fuss?
[30:38] When you had finished that matter then what was the need to embarrass them?
[30:43] Hold on.
[30:46] Have I embarrassed them? Me?
[30:50] But how?
[30:51] Well, I was embarrassed as well.
[30:53] I was apologizing in front of everyone.
[30:58] It's a big embarrassment for an honorable family that their guest apologize in front of them.
[31:04] Yes, it's for honorable families.
[31:07] But how is this insulting for this family.
[31:10] Do you know that what are you doing with your son's life?
[31:15] What am I doing, I am arranging his marriage.
[31:19] You are injecting poison and destroying his life.
[31:22] You are spreading thorns in his path.
[31:25] Why?
[31:26] Just because of this that the girl he likes is my sister's and your sister-in-law's daughter 
[31:32] and that's why you hater her so much.
[31:35] I am not doing any such thing.
[31:37] He is my son so why would I do bad for him.
[31:41] And I won't let you do anything bad for him.
[31:44] And listen to me very carefully 
[31:46] that it won't be good for you if you will do again whatever you have done today.
[31:51] Mr. Ahmed.
Bring my clothes.
[31:54] Listen to me.
[31:57] I will neither listen nor will say anything, I will only watch.
[32:04] And if you again try to create any fuss
[32:08] Then I will treat you in a very harsh way. Do you understand?
[32:13] I think, I have made myself very clear.
[32:18] Mr. Ahmed, I am talking to you.
[32:22] Mr. Ahmed.
[32:32] Well, I was thinking something.
[32:35] There must be no cable TV in your in-laws.
[32:40] Did you ask Adeel about that?
[32:43] What do you mean? I didn't understand?
[32:46] You didn't understand such a minor thing. I mean to say
[32:50] When her in-laws have already got a natural drama in the form of her mother-in-law
[32:55] Then they don't need other entertainment.
[32:59] You will live very happily there. You won't get bored there at all.
[33:05] Don't say natural, that was supernatural. 
[33:09] Did you see her face, when she was apologizing to dad.
[33:12] Her expressions were so amazing.
[33:14] She was saying that brother, we made a mistake, please forgive us. Did you see that. Right?
[33:22] Both of you don't feel ashamed?
[33:24] This is so bad.
[33:26] She is your elder and you are talking like this about her.
[33:30] Just keep quiet. Let me repeat that.
[33:33] Yes please.
Give me your scarf.
[33:34] Take it.
[33:35] Saad, what are you doing?
Just keep quiet.
[33:37] Aunt is here, what if she listens to you.
[33:41] Hey, she won't come here so keep quiet.
[33:44] Well.
[33:46] There shouldn't be any grievances in our hearts.
[33:53] Mr. Manzoor, I made a very big mistake.
[33:58] She was absolutely doing like this.
[34:00] Please forgive me.
[34:05] I will treat Zara as my daughter not like daughter-in-law.
[34:11] Saad, you are so mean.
[34:15] Give it to me. What if she sees you.
Zara.
[34:25] Aunt, actually Saad and Zenny....
I know.
[34:32] I know, there are some boys like him.
[34:37] Cheap.
[34:41] Do you know that there was a boy like him in my neighborhood.
[34:45] Do you know, what does he do these days?
[34:48] He dances in the well of death.
[34:51] Aunt, there is no such thing. 
[34:53] He was just just joking because he is very jolly. I apologize to you.
[34:56] Oh I see.
[34:59] OK. OK
[35:01] Don't tell me anything, I know very well about his family background.
[35:08] But it's very bad thing.
[35:11] If he is habitual of joking with others then he should also tolerate with others' joking.
[35:18] Look at his face got paled so suddenly.
[35:24] Come with me and press my dress.
OK, I am coming.
[35:33] I was forbidding both of you.
[35:36] But you don't listen to anyone.
Zara. Listen.
[35:43] I was just joking.
[35:46] Yes we know that but she doesn't know that we were joking.
Did you see?
[35:51] How much she has taunted me.
[35:53] Yes.
Cheap boy
[35:55] He dances in well of death.
Leave it, she will scold Zara so much.
[36:01] I am concerned about her.
[36:11] Oh my God.
[36:13] They didn't leave anything.
[36:16] They took phone charger as well.
[36:19] Mahi, call dad.
What's this.
[36:23] Why did you open the door?
There is nothing Mahi.
[36:27] I don't know them.
Stop this nonsense.
[36:30] One of those boys was taking your name. You know them.
[36:35] Do you have any phone? I have to call dad.
[36:37] They were robbers Mahi. I don't know them.
[36:40] You don't know me Mirha.
[36:42] Tell as much lie as you want. I won't ask about truth from you.
[36:46]  In fact I will tell you the truth now.
[36:49] Oh.
[36:59] Mom.
[37:01] Mom.
[37:03] Mom, you are still not understanding aunt Farida's mood. I am surprised.
[37:08] So what should we do?
[37:10]  Ask them to give divorce to Zara and let her sit here like you.
[37:15] What do you mean by that?
[37:20] I mean that we can't let her stay here. We have to marry her.
[37:24] What do you mean?
[37:25] What do you mean by "you can't let her sit her like me"?
[37:29] Mom, are you fed up that I am staying here.
[37:33] Maheen, that was slipped out of my mouth. Don't stick with that for no reason.
[37:39] Such things are not without any reason.
[37:41] Whatever is in your heart comes out someday.
[37:46] Maheen.
[37:55] As you know that your parents are not among those people who consider their daughters a burden.
[38:01] We can't fight with others for no reason.
[38:05] OK mom, from now on, I won't interfere in others' matters. 
[38:08] Just do what you think is right.
[38:30] What do you think that what will aunt Farida do?
[38:35] I am just thinking that what will happen to us now?
[38:40] You are future son-in-law of this house so no one will say anything to you.
[38:45] But mom will kill me.
[38:50] Leave us apart, think about Zara.
[38:53] The way she has taken her from here. I am so scared for her.
[38:59] Let's see by going there.
[39:00] Not at all. If she will see us again then she will become more angry.
[39:05] Don't be fooled with her smile. That was fake.
[39:08] Let's see by going there. I am so scared.
[39:12] No, I can't make this mistake again.
[39:22] O God, have mercy.
