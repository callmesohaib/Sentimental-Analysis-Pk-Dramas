[00:12] It's been a week mom.
[00:15] Zenny didn't talk to me.
[00:19] She is very uncomfortable because of my stay here.
[00:22] I don't like it mom.
[00:26] I will go back.
[00:28] Mom Zara want me to give her divorce.
[00:31] What?
[00:34] Your happiness matters to me. I only want to see you happy.
[00:39] For God sake, stop your drama.
[00:42] And I don't want love in charity.
[01:47] Come in.
[01:52] Sir, miss Zenny has arrived, her interview is lined up for today.
[01:57] Send her.
OK sir.
[02:51] Sir, may I come in?
[02:55] Yes
[02:59] Sir, you called me.
Yes.
[03:02] It's 3:40.
[03:04] Are are aware about lunch hours?
[03:06] Yes sir.
Where have you been?
[03:09] Do you know that I was waiting for you for the last 30 minutes.
[03:12] Sir, I am so sorry. Actually, I went out for some important work.
[03:18] With whom?
[03:20] What do you mean sir?
[03:20] I mean, is everything fine by your side?
[03:25] You would have gone for some important work.
Yes sir.
[03:29] That was a very important work.
[03:31] I will give you all updates after ten minutes.
[03:35] Sure
[03:37] Thank you.
[04:02] If you want me to forgive you.
[04:06] Then you will have to do whatever I will ask you to do
[04:11] You will have to tell the truth to everyone.
[04:14] Whatever you did to my sister-in-law, now you will tell everyone that it was not her fault.
[04:21] And you have done that on Mahi's instructions.
[04:34] Doctor tell me about my reports.
[04:38] Yes Maheen, I have got your reports but
[04:41] I have no good news for you.
[04:44] What do you mean? I didn't get your point.
[04:47] There are so many complications in your case.
[04:52] Which complications?
[04:55] Tell us openly about her problem doctor.
[04:58] I have studied her case in detail.
[05:04] I was in doubt but my doubt got cleared from her reports.
[05:11] She can never become a mother.
[05:20] What
[05:26] Mom
[05:29] Mom, what is she saying?
[05:33] You are lying to us, right?
[05:36] I will file a case against you.
[05:40] How can you make this false report about me.
[05:44] Maheen relax.
[05:48] Maheen, control yourself. What's wrong with you.
[05:52] Mom didn't you hear what she is saying.
[05:56] I am normal and my family is normal and if Zara and Dolly can become a mother then why can't I become a mother? This is lie.
[06:07] Maheen, their cases are different than your case.
Just shut up.
[06:11] You are lying. I don't believe you at all.
[06:17] You can check these reports from some other doctor and you can conduct your tests from some other lab.
[06:24] Please don't take stress. It's not good for you. Don't think negatively.
[06:31] This was the reason earlier as well for all of this.
[06:38] Mom, didn't she get any doubt.
[06:41] No I don't think so.
[06:44] If that was the case then she should have said something.
[06:47] Mom pray that we may succeed in our objective for which we have sent here there.
If God wills.
[06:54] May Saad and Zara understand each others' sentiments.
[06:59] Whatever we have done to bring both of them close to each other
[07:03] May we get succeed in our efforts. Ameen.
Mom, I am feeling really bad.
[07:09] I said so much to Zara.
No problem my child.
[07:13] Sometime we have to do something we don't like by doing something.
[07:21] But whatever you have done was for both of them betterment.
[07:25] Mom I want brother and Zara to live happily together.
[07:30] And I am sure that brother also wants this.
[07:33] I have seen love for Zara in brother's eyes.
[07:37] I pray to God that Zara may realize Saad's love.
[07:42] Ameen
[07:52] Mom why have you brought this?
[08:35] You are back. I was waiting for you since long.
[08:39] Why?
[08:40] And what are you doing here?
[08:42] I thought you will need some support so I was waiting for you.
[08:47] What do you mean?
[08:48] What do you want to say?
[08:50] It means that you don't know anything about this.
[08:54] About what?
[08:55] Zara has gone back to her house.
[09:00] Yes
[09:08] What happened? Hey.
[09:16] It will be fun now. Zara vs Zenny once again.
[09:26] Why did Zara do this to me?
[09:35] Why do you do this to me Zara?
[09:39] Why did you do this to me?
[09:45] Why?
[09:54] Why Zara
[09:56] What do you get by doing all of this?
[10:07] Mahi. Mahi
[10:10] Mahi.
What's the matter? Why are you shouting?
Where is Mahi? Call her.
[10:14] What's the matter?
[10:16] What's the matter dad? Why are you shouting like this?
[10:24] What is this? Why have you done this?
[10:29] Have you rewarded us for our trust and love?
[10:36] Forgive me. I made this mistake. Forgive me.
[10:41] Look at this, what has she done.
Dad, I made this mistake, please forgive me.
[10:46] Mahi
[10:48] Mahi
[10:50] What is this?
[10:53] I won't do this again. Please forgive me.
[10:59] We can't face anyone because of you Mahi.
[11:03] Please listen to me.
It's only because of your leniency.
[11:08] Neither you had given her that leverage nor she would have gone out of this house by defaming me.
[11:15] Mom, dad, please forgive me.
[11:21] How many times I will have to forgive you.
[11:25] I have been forgiving you being my eldest daughter.
[11:30] But you defamed me.
No dad, I didn't do any such thing. Please listen to me once.
[11:49] How did you...
I mean that how did you come?
[11:56] I have come back because of aunt.
[11:58] Thank God that you came back because of her.
[12:01] What?
No.
[12:04] If you wouldn't have come then I would have taken care of mom.
[12:08] OK Saad, I will go back tomorrow.
No, I didn't mean to say that.
[12:14] You can stay here as long as you want.
[12:20] Do I serve dinner for you
[12:23] Have you eaten?
[12:31] Can we eat together?
[12:43] Let me serve dinner.
[12:55] Mom, please ask dad to forgive me. I won't do anything like this again.
[13:02] Mahi what have you done to us?
[13:07] I made a very big mistake. Please ask dad to forgive me.
[13:11] I didn't expect this from you Mahi. I didn't expect this from you.
[13:17] Who has come Mirha?
[13:22] Mom
[13:38] You
[13:51] What are you doing here? What do you want from us?
[14:00] I want to tell you something.
[14:03] I am Mirha's friend Aqib.
[14:12] Mirha doesn't know anything about it. She has nothing to do with that.
[14:17] Whatever happened that night was just a lie.
[14:22] I have no relation with your daughter-in-law. I didn't know her.
[14:32] What nonsense. You are lying.
[14:37] My daughters don't lie. You are lying.
Aunt I am telling you the truth.
[14:43] And whatever your daughter-in-law was saying that night was also true.
[14:47] She knew that she is being trapped intentionally.
[14:50] But even then she didn't say anything.
[14:53] Rather she kept the honor of this house and dignity of your daughters safe.
[14:58] Both of us didn't know each other.
[15:01] I did that out of a compulsion.
[15:04] I made a very big mistake uncle please forgive me.
[15:10] You cheap man, I will kill you.
[15:14] I will kill you.
[15:17] Such a big deception.
[15:19] Such a big deception.
[15:24] Uncle forgive me
[15:26] Shameless person.
[15:28] Didn't you feel ashamed.
[15:31] Why did you do this to us? What did we do wrong to you?
[15:37] You guys forgive me.
[15:40] I am in love with Mirha.
[15:43] I have made this very big mistake.
[15:45] I shouldn't have betrayed Mirha.
[15:48] And nor I should have done all that to your daughter-in-law.
[15:56] Then why did you do that?
[15:59] Actually
[16:06] I was compelled.
Who forced you?
[16:10] What was your compulsion?
I was forced
[16:14] Who incited you to do that?
[16:18] Get out of our house.
Mahi asked me to do that.
[16:20] What? He is lying.
[16:24] Dad believe me.
[16:27] I didn't do anything.
[16:30] I didn't do anything.
[16:32] He is a liar.
[16:35] How can you do that Mahi?
[16:39] What have you done?
[16:55] Here is your tea.
Thank you.
[17:02] Did you talk to Zara?
Yes, I called her.
[17:07] Did she tell any reason for going suddenly?
Yes.
[17:11] I asked her about that so she told me that aunt's health got deteriorated so I am going because Dolly can't go.
[17:17] I thank God that she went there anyway
[17:22] But now I am observing that ever since she has gone back
[17:27] Zenny's mood is off.
[17:30] Ever since she has returned from office she didn't eat anything and locked herself in room.
[17:37] You should advise her.
[17:39] What do I do? She composed herself.
[17:41] But she is again got disturbed because of Zara's arrival.
[17:47] I want Zara to go back to her house. I also talked to her in the morning.
[17:53] But she is still stuck on her point that she won't live with Saad.
[17:56] And she says that this time she will make decision by herself.
[18:00] Did you talk to Saad?
No, I got busy in some work so I couldn't call him.
[18:09] I am also worried Sarwat.
[18:12] Because three lives are connected with this matter.
[18:20] And I think if two persons get agreed on same point in any matter then third person should compromise.
[18:30] Yes, but it's very difficult to spend life with compromises.
[18:35] But if there is no way out then we should accept compromises as decision of nature.
[18:43] It makes life easy.
[18:48] You went to doctor with Maheen. What did she say?
[18:53] Yes I went with her. Doctor said that everything is alright.
[18:59] Thank God, we got some relief from one side.
[19:03] Ask Maheen to leave everything to God.
[19:06] God willing, everything will be alright.
[19:10] Yes, I asked her to do the same.
[19:16] Get out.
Mahi gave me money to do that.
[19:18] No dad, he is lying.
[19:21] Dad believe me, I didn't do anything like that. He is a liar.
[19:25] I am not lying. You know that I don't lie. I didn't do anything.
[19:29] Mahi how could you do all of that
[19:37] And you get lost from here before I will kill you.
[19:43] Get lost.
[19:50] Oh my God, what have I done.
[19:59] Believe me dad I didn't do anything.
How could you do that.
[20:05] Why did you do that Mahi?
[20:09] What did she do wrong to you?
I did so much for you Mahi.
[20:17] I always fulfilled your wishes by going against your father's consent.
[20:24] But you did this to me.
[20:27] And you accused Zara with such a big blame.
[20:33] You snatched all my dignity from me.
[20:37] But you didn't feel content and you accused Zara with such a big blame
[20:44] Why? Why did you do that?
[20:49] Didn't you feel ashamed a bit.
[20:51] Didn't you feel ashamed? Why didn't you die?
[20:54] Why didn't you die before doing all of that.
[20:59] Why did you do that?
Mom, please forgive me.
[21:03] Don't touch me. I am not your mother.
[21:07] You didn't do good to all of us.
[21:13] You did great injustice to all of us.
[21:15] You did great injustice to me, to Zara and to all of us.
Mom, please forgive me, I made that mistake. Please.
[21:26] I couldn't even think that you can do that Mahi.
[21:33] You didn't even leave your sister.
[21:38] You ruined Zara's life but you also ruined your own sister's life.
[21:47] You also effected her in your hatred.
[21:52] Ahmed. Ahmed.
Dad. Dad.
[21:57] Dad get up.
Mirha bring water.
[22:00] Dad please forgive me. I won't do that again.
[22:05] Ahmed. Ahmed.
Dad, drink water.
[22:09] Dad please forgive me. I won't do that again.
Call doctor.
[22:15] Ahmed. Ahmed.
[22:21] What happened to brother Ahmed? How is he feeling now?
[22:24] Your brother got effected by Zara's bad condition.
[22:29] He is not right.
[22:59] Mahi, if anything happened to your dad then I will never forgive you.
[23:04] Why are you saying this mom, nothing will happen to dad.
You have ruined everything.
[23:10] What else is left.
[23:12] He is in this condition because of you.
[23:16] He is fighting for his life.
[23:19] He couldn't bear the trauma given by you.
[23:24] What have you done Mahi? What did you earn by doing that?
[23:29] Mom.
Get lost. I don't want to see your face.
[23:33] Mom please don't say that.
[23:36] I have no one except you. Where will I go?
You have taken revenge of this thing from us.
[23:42] I never scolded you on any of your mistake. I never forbade you from doing bad things.
[23:47] That's why you did all of that.
[23:50] Mahi you didn't even think about your own sister.
[23:53] You ruined her life.
[23:55] I couldn't understand that he is the same bad boy.
[24:01] Zara didn't say a single word about both of you and about that boy. She only kept giving clarification about herself.
[24:10] He was the same boy. Am I right?
[24:14] Mirha
[24:15] You didn't tell me about him either.
[24:17] Mom, I was about to tell you but.
I understood.
[24:23] What did you do Mahi?
Mirha take her away from my sight.
[24:28] Take her away from my sight.
[24:30] At least you should have cared about anyone.
[24:33] Adeel will ask me, how will I respond?
Why didn't you die Mahi.
[24:40] Mirha take her away from my sight.
[24:44] I don't want to see her face. When I see her face then Zara's face comes in my eyes.
[24:52] What did you do Mahi?
[24:54] For what you took revenge?
[24:57] Go away from my sight. I don't want to see your face.
[25:00] Mom please.
Take her away.
[25:04] I don't want to see your face.
[25:06] Go away from my sight.
[25:15] Mom
[25:17] What's the matter? Are you alright?
Yes, I am fine. I was just feeling suffocated so I went out.
[25:25] Mom are you alright?
[25:27] Is there anything to worry about?
[25:29] I am perfectly alright.
[25:31] I don't know why I did feel suffocation suddenly?
[25:36] Let me take you to doctor. Everything will be alright.
Hey no.
[25:40] I am telling you that I was just feeling suffocation.
[25:43] I will feel better if I will lay down for a while.
[25:45] Take rest. I will take you to doctor if needed.
OK, I will tell you.
[25:50] OK
[25:55] Doctor
[25:57] How is my husband feeling now?
[25:58] We are here since last night but you are not giving us any update on his condition.
[26:02] We are trying our best to stabilize his condition.
[26:05] He has got a major heart attack.
[26:07] We will have to operate him immediately.
[26:10] So why aren't you doing operation. Do that immediately.
Our surgeon is out of city, we will start operating him as soon as he arrives.
[26:17] You can get remaining information from reception.
[26:19] O God, why are we facing this problem for no reason.
[26:24] Please sit down. I will be back right away. Sit here.
[26:27] My heart is pounding Mahi.
I will be right back. Please sit.
[26:39] My child.
[26:41] You have returned to Pakistan after a long time.
[26:44] Yes after two years.
[26:46] I came back last time and went back after we got married.
[26:49] Now I have come back again and my friends informed me that Zara and Saad got married so I couldn't stop myself.
[26:54] And I have come along with her immediately.
[26:57] Mom it's his old habit. He can't wait.
[27:00] Well Fiza is also very bothered from this habit of mine.
[27:03] I am used to it now.
[27:06] It's nice to feel each others absence. This makes our relations stronger.
[27:12] I am glad to see your happy couple. May God keep your relation in tact.
Ameen. Thanks aunt.
[27:18] Sister
[27:19] You should say something as well. You are sitting quietly.
[27:22] I am fine. Please have some. You haven't taken anything.
[27:26] By the way brother Saad you are so lucky.
[27:28] You have got such a beautiful wife.
[27:30] And I have heard that you got top position in whole university.
[27:34] Let me tell you about that.
[27:35] We worked really hard throughout the year
[27:38] But she only used to study during last week and became topper.
[27:41] Am I right Saad.
Yes you are absolutely right.
[27:44] By the way Zara, why don't you find a job for yourself.
[27:46] She has a very good GPA aunt.
[27:48] And you will get job in any firm very easily. Am I right?
[27:52] Yes my child.
[27:54] I have no objection.
[27:56] It's upto Zara.
Fantastic.
[27:59] You have got aunt's support as well.
[28:01] You must think about it.
[28:03] By the way, let me tell you aunt
[28:05] Both of them used to fight so much in university that our whole time passed in resolving their quarrels.
[28:12] Well they are same till now.
Really? But why?
[28:17] Your quarrels should have finished by now.
[28:19] Well I want this to happen but your friend doesn't agree with me.
[28:23] Stop it Saad.
There is love hidden behind this anger.
[28:27] Yes you are right.
[28:29] By the way, I am glad to see both of you together.
[28:32] It is said that you are made for each so it's like that.
[28:40] Let me bring water.
[28:46] Have some my child. You haven't taken anything.
Sure, I will take it.
[28:54] Are you with patient Ahmed?
Yes.
[28:57] Who is Zara among you?
[28:59] Zara?
Yes.
[29:01] Is my husband alright? How is he now?
[29:05] Patient is continuously taking Zara's name. If Zara is not here then please call her and ask her to come here. Thank you.
OK.
[29:15] Call her.
[29:23] The most precious thing in life is life itself my child.
[29:31] Life doesn't stop nor it ends if we lose / break in love, marriage, or losing any relation or any thing else.
[29:48] The decision you are going to make is not right.
[29:54] I don't know that why are you doing this.
[29:59] But being a mother, I can understand emotions of my children.
[30:10] No matter if you don't want to tell me anything
[30:14] But I know
[30:21] You also start to like Saad.
[30:26] Yes my child, I know about it.
[30:30] You didn't commit any sin.
[30:34] And I also know that why are you afraid of moving forward towards Saad?
[30:43] Adeel was your past my child.
[30:47] And Saad is your present.
[30:52] And Nikah is so powerful that it gives life to even two strangers' life less relation.
[31:02] This is the power of Nikah
[31:05] Which has raised emotions in hearts of both of you.
[31:12] You can't give away a sacred relationship like marriage.
[31:20] Rather you take care of that and keep that in tact.
[31:25] So that a third person can't make room for himself in that relation.
[31:42] And this is your place my child. Only yours.
[31:48] And no one can snatch this from you.
[31:53] You will have to hold this relationship very tightly.
[32:01] Are you getting my point?
[32:04] Hmm?
[32:34] Mom, Farida aunt has called on your phone.
[32:39] Sister Farida's call for me?
[32:50] What's up sister Farida, is everything alright?
[32:56] What happened to brother?
[33:02] When?
[33:05] How?
[33:08] Where is he now?
[33:10] Where?
[33:17] Yes, we are coming immediately.
[33:24] What happened?
Brother has got a heart attack.
[33:28] He is taking Zara's name continuously.
[33:33] Ali take me there to my brother.
[33:38] Right mom. Dolly call Saad and ask him to bring Zara here immediately.
[33:44] Mom, let me call dad, he will also come.
[33:50] Don't worry.
Dad.
[33:54] Dad, uncle Ahmed has got heart attack. Please come home quickly. We are leaving for hospital.
[34:00] He is in hospital since last night.
[34:04] Don't worry.
Ali ask Zara to come.
[34:07] OK mom.
Dad please come, we are leaving.
[34:11] OK.
My brother.
[34:14] My dear brother.
Nothing will happen.
[35:52] Stop it mom.
Sister Farida.
[35:58] Sarwat, your brother..
What happened to brother Ahmed? How is he now?
[36:04] Your brother got effected because of Zara's bad condition.
[36:09] His condition is not good.
[36:14] And do you know that Zara didn't do anything wrong.
[36:20] That was not her fault. She didn't have any relation with anyone. I misunderstood the whole scenario.
[36:31] And now your brother's condition is not good.
[36:37] He continuously taking Zara's name and he is calling her again and again.
[36:43] Just leave this topic sister.
[36:45] Tell me what are doctors saying about his condition.
[36:48] How can I leave?
[36:50] How can I leave Sarwat?
[36:53] I have told you the truth today.
[36:57] But earlier I always used to spread hatred.
[37:03] But I got effected by that. Your brother condition is not good.
[37:12] You did cruelty to my brother.
[37:15] You did great cruelty to my daughter and to all of us.
[37:26] I am your culprit.
[37:29] I am your culprit and I am your daughter's culprit as well. Please forgive me.
[37:36] Please forgive me.
[37:38] Please pray for my brother's safe recovery.
[37:41] Please pray for my brother's safe recovery.
[37:46] So that I could apologize to him.
[37:49] For God sake, please forgive me.
[37:56] His condition is not good. Doctors are hopeless.
[38:04] They asked us to pray for him. Please forgive me.
I have forgiven you sister. I have forgiven you.
[38:25] May my brother recover safely.
[38:52] Dear uncle.
Yes.
[38:55] Dear uncle.
[38:58] Dear uncle, I am here with you.
[39:01] Zara
[39:04] Zara.
I am here with you.
[39:07] Forgive me.
