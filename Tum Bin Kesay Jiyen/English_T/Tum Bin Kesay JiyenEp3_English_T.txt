[00:15] Tea will only drive your sleep away. 
[00:18] But tiredness was only an excuse to get tea.
[00:21]  I know all your ploys, since I've been seeing them from our childhood.
[00:25] Here you are, have your tea. 
[00:27] how progressive you two have become. 
[00:30] When I got married... I didn't talk to my husband in front of anyone for months!
[00:37] But I think this is just about one's morals. 
[00:40] I was very shy.
[00:43] Zara's in-laws live so far away. It's not like she can come here daily from Hyderabad.
[00:48] If you are so wise, then why weren't you so smart when it came to you?
[00:54] I mean, husband and wives with each almost every other day. 
[00:58] Why did you come back home after two years?
[01:09] so my guess was right
[01:12] last night the late night discussion was with Mahi
[01:19] I didn't had an idea, but I was sure that what is going to happen at your sister's house
[01:27] what is about to happen at Sarwat's house?
[01:29] your dearest daughter-in-law & her cunning sisters has made Mahi's life a living hell
[01:37] I had told you, not to send Adeel
[01:41] but nobody listens to me in this house
[01:44] oho, you know it was important for the children to go there
[01:48] I had told you
[01:50] I saw a dream, if Adeel didn't go to Karachi then his mother...
[01:56] nothing is going to happen to me
[01:58] and you had lied, so that you can send Adeel
[02:02] I know
[02:03] So, even you had lied that you saw a dream so that you can stop Adeel here
[02:09] not at all! I have seen the dream in real & you know my dreams are true
[02:15] even I was scared
[02:17] what if my dream comes true then what if my wife...
[02:22] its so wrong, its your old habit to stall any matter as a joke
[02:27] anyways, leave everything & tell me what I am asking
[02:32] who will ask them, is this how you treat your guests?
[02:37] my daughter is in such a bad condition while crying continuously
[02:42] will you talk or shall I talk to Serwat myself, then nobody will say that I have misbehaved with them
[02:48] Look, whatever is happening in that house I am very well aware of it
[02:54] I had a word with Adeel
[02:57] and if I wanted to talk to someone then it won't be Sarwat but Mahi
[03:04] what will you talk to Mahi about?
[03:05] its sisters duty to keep their brothers family united
[03:11] and she shall stop creating problems between Zara & Adeel
[03:15] is Mahir creating the difficulties?
[03:19] what she did?
[03:22] and who is giving you such reports?
[03:26] anyways, why am I asking you? 
its obvious...
[03:29] Zara must be calling you
[03:32] honestly, she is such a cunning girl!
[03:35] See, even its true & if Zara is talking to me then what's the problem in it?
[03:41] if she is discussing her problems with me, after all she is my daughter
[03:45] She is not your daughter, Mahi is your daughter
[03:49] who is getting taunts in that house for her divorce
[03:53] who is being called the witch who is creating fuss in the house
[03:58] impossible!
[04:00] those girls can never use such words
[04:04] you are making up all of these stories
[04:08] you are lying!
[04:11] Adeel has misbehaved with her, and made her apologize in front of Zara
[04:17] lie!
[04:18] and stop telling me such things by exaggerating them, Farida
[04:23] I am very well aware of whatever is happening in that house
[04:26] really?
[04:27] then you must also know that what your dear niece was doing in our son's room
[04:35] its such a shameful thing though
[04:38] Zara & Adeel are husband & wife, they can meet wherever they want to
[04:43] they are not husband & wife, they have just pronounced their nuptial vows now
[04:47] there is a difference in between a wife & fiance
[04:51] really?
[04:53] if there is a difference then alright, lets remove this difference
[04:57] start preparations, meanwhile let me call Manzoor
[05:02] We'll soon bring our mandate from there after doing the reception ceremony
[05:06] Okay?
[05:12] oh God, what have I done?
[05:17] I had forgotten this matter myself while explaining Mahi, that we don't have to discuss this matter else it will come on our head
[05:22] now its on our head!
[05:26] Mr. Ahmed
[05:29] Mr. Ahmed...
[05:39] hey Zara, come sit here with Adeel
[05:43] somebody had said, there should be understanding between a husband & a wife
[05:47] otherwise, their condition will become same like mine
[05:53] what's wrong Mahi dear?
[05:56] oh no aunt, nothing
[05:59] actually, yesterday somebody had taught me that its important to have an understanding between a husband & a wife
[06:04] otherwise divorces happen
[06:07] like I have got one
[06:09] 2 years ago...
[06:17] what's wrong dear? Has someone said something to you?
[06:20] its all about fate, what's your fault in it?
[06:24] I had said it
[06:26] why I had said it, ask that too
[06:29] no matter what the reason is
[06:31] you shouldn't have said such things
[06:34] dad, but I..
[06:34] Enough!
[06:36] no more argument
[06:38] say sorry to Mahi & end this matter
[06:42] Dad, how can you ask me to apologize without listening to my side of the story?
[06:46] its not my mistake. I won't apologize
[06:54] uncle, let it be. Its ok
[06:57] her apology won't make any difference
[07:00] its obvious, I will get taunts since I am divorced
[07:04] its ok, I haven't mind it
[07:20] I am leaving, as I'm getting late
[07:23] hey...
[07:25] at least drink your tea then leave, what's wrong?
[07:29] No mom
[07:31] who can drink the tea now?
[07:38] Okay bye!
[07:47] I think now we shall end this argument
[07:51] serve the tea dear
Adeel, take some tea
[08:06] its completely cold
[08:08] let me make another one
[08:11] yes please, make it
[08:33] Zara, why she had said such distance related things? What had happened?
[08:38] No, there isn't any such thing
[08:42] there is something for sure, else she would have never said such things on the table in front of all
[08:48] Tell me, I am asking you something Zara
[08:52] I'm telling you, nothing happened
[08:55] you are hiding from me Zara, I'm sure something might have happened
[08:59] and girls like Mahi are called, bad sister-in-laws!
[09:05] I can write it down, she is here to create some mess for sure
[09:10] and you are giving her full chance if you'll hide something
[09:15] believe me, there is no such thing
[09:18] I won't believe you, because you are lying to me
[09:21] girls like you don't get a lesson until you don't get hurt
[09:25] at least don't say this
[09:26] I'm saying this Zara so that nothing wrong shall happen
[09:30] Besides, you won't do anything. Now I have to answer her to set her straight
[09:36] don't spread thorns in your path, Zara. Such kind of in-laws are a trial
[09:41] you have to take every step very cautiously
[09:48] don't worry, I am telling you nothing as such will happen
[09:52] Fine! I will talk to Adeel tomorrow
[09:55] you'll talk to Adeel? About what? I'm telling you nothing as such had happened
[10:01] because you are lying to me, Zara
[10:05] Fine
[10:07] then talk to Adeel
[10:19] Adeel, the reason behind talking to you is that
[10:24] you are Zara's husband
[10:26] and eventually you are responsible for her somehow, whether she has a direct relation with you or not
[10:34] and I also understand that its not only one person's fault
[10:39] So if Mahi is angry then maybe its Zara's mistake as well
[10:46] aunt, there isn't any fault of Zara
[10:50] sure?
[10:52] you think this way?
[10:54] yes aunt
[10:57] Zara is married to me & Mahi is my sister
[11:00] both relations are respectable for me
[11:03] but I will blame that person who did the mistake
[11:07] and Zara doesn't have any fault in this situation
[11:11] yes dear, but if...
[11:14] Mahi has mind something, then something wrong must have happened. She won't say anything on her own
[11:24] Adeel look
[11:27] right now, neither consider me your mother-in-law or your aunt
[11:31] you are just like Ali to me, just like my son
[11:36] and the way you haven't differentiated between Mahi & Zara while doing justice
[11:42] I'm telling you, I will do the same. But dear, I should know
[11:47] what had happened?
[11:53] aunt, actually I...
[11:57] I was with Zara, Mahi came over & said something inappropriate
[12:26] by the way, what were you discussing on the way. I wasn't getting it
[12:31] tell me now
[12:32] not now, I will tell you later
[12:35] but I have time right now, we can talk. Tell me
[12:40] Just like that, I was talking about brother Adnan
[12:45] that guy seems quite shady to me
[12:48] he says something inappropriate while talking that a person looses its cool
[12:52] what as such he had said?
[12:55] the same rubbish!
[12:57] he had talked about me & Zara
[13:00] Why? What he had said about you & Zara?
[13:05] the same thing, that such people say
[13:08] when a guy & a girl are friends
[13:10] oh...
[13:12] and why are you telling me this? What's the point?
[13:17] Nothing! I was just saying it like that
[13:20] Saad, if you are telling me this so that I don't doubt you both by coming into anyone's words
[13:27] then nobody is as stupid as you are!
[13:31] I mean...
Saad look!
[13:33] Zara is my sister
[13:35] I know her very well
[13:37] I trust her completely
[13:42] and on me?
[13:45] on you too, stupid!
[13:47] and I am not going to give an ear on anyone's words
[13:50] who says what or thinks what, it doesn't make any difference to me
[13:55] one more thing! I'm so sure about one thing
[14:00] what's mine is only mine
[14:03] nobody can snatch it away from me, no matter how hard anyone tries
[14:09] by the way, you are talking so good today. So lets take an off
[14:14] off?
[14:16] yes
[14:17] we'll go & sit somewhere
[14:22] you keep talking such things
[14:25] and I will keep listening to you
[14:28] there is no need to! today you'll listen to my good talks
[14:33] and the way I will be insulted tomorrow, that won't be good at all
[14:37] and here, they don't insult you while sitting
[14:40] do you know, they make you stand in front of the entire class insult you
[14:45] Ok then, I am leaving now
[14:47] Okay
[14:47] ok listen
yes?
[14:48] shall I come to pick you?
[14:50] you may see
[14:53] you can come if you get time
[14:56] otherwise, still do come
Ok bye!
[14:59] I will come, bye!
[15:06] now tell me uncle, what's my fault or mistake in it?
[15:11] if I have stopped Adeel for something then what wrong I've done?
[15:16] don't know what not Zara is telling Maheen, and now she is taunting me
[15:20] no no, you did the right thing dear
[15:23] being an elder its your duty
[15:27] actually its not Adeel & Zara's mistake as well
[15:31] its ours
[15:33] we shouldn't have prolonged this nuptial vows for too long
[15:36] no no uncle, we aren't in a hurry to do the wedding
[15:39] we'll do the wedding ceremony as per our convenience
[15:42] but we are in a hurry, dear
[15:44] we want Zara to wed off as soon as possible
[15:48] I had talked to her mother as well, and we would have talked if your mother or father would have come
[15:54] but they haven't thought about it as of yet
[15:58] shall I tell you something?
[16:00] stop their meetings
[16:04] restrictions?
[16:07] dear, when there aren't any restrictions as per the religion
[16:10] then who am I to restrict them in an official relation?
[16:15] yes?
[16:17] in fact, do one thing
[16:19] stop interfering in this matter now
[16:22] these are elders matters, they'll sit & decide it mutually
[16:27] the children won't speak in this matter by any means
[16:32] Ok
[16:35] yes
[16:36] very good!
[16:42] what have I done?
[16:44] mom was right, I shouldn't have discussed it
[16:48] would you like to drink tea or so. Will you eat something?
[16:51] No thank you!
[16:52] from your face, it looks as if you haven't eaten since so long
[16:59] its all done by you, Mahi
[17:03] if you saw something, then you could have kept your mouth shut!
[17:09] but no!
[17:11] you have to speak in that every matter, where you need to say quiet
[17:15] Fine! You can scold me as much as you want to
[17:18] because you cannot scold someone else, no one else is in your control
[17:22] so, who had asked you to enter their rooms?
[17:26] and to listen to their discussions?
[17:30] you have escalated the matter, Mahi. Now admit your mistake
[17:35] ok fine! I accept that it was my mistake
[17:38] Fine! Now tell me how will you handle all this? How will you stop this wedding?
[17:43] answer me!
[17:46] I will
[17:49] I have to do something somehow
[17:51] but whatever I will do, I will do it myself
[17:56] you have already ruined everything Mahi, for God sake now don't do anything else
[18:01] oh please mom! there is no need to say such things to me
[18:05] your son isn't in your control at all
[18:09] and same is the case with dad
[18:11] even after your confrontation he got your only son Adeel married to Zara
[18:17] whether its my mistake or not, but this wedding ceremony will take place
[18:21] what can you do? You can do nothing. When you couldn't do anything earlier, so you won't be able to do anything now
[18:25] the earlier times were different
[18:28] now I have to do something
[18:31] this girl cannot come to my house as a daughter-in-law at any cost
[18:37] but please stay out of all these matter. For God sake!
[18:44] I won't say anything.
You & I, both are here. Lets see what will happen
[19:09] Adeel
[19:11] you've scared me
[19:14] I haven't scared you
[19:16] in fact, this cruel society has
[19:19] its nothing like that
[19:21] there is no cruel society in between us
[19:24] really?
[19:25] then why aren't you giving importance to me?
[19:28] is there any anger or so?
[19:30] you know it very well
[19:33] that I cannot stay upset with you
[19:35] then are you being cautious?
[19:37] yes... haven't you heard? "precaution is better than cure"
[19:41] really?
[19:43] now you'll talk against treatment, while being a doctor's wife?
[19:47] that's wrong!
[19:48] you'll shut down my work
[19:50] it seems that your treatment is not done in the right manner. Let me call your doctor right away
[19:54] Maha...
No, absolutely not!
[19:57] already she had opened such a big case
[19:59] besides... 
[20:01] now the big doctors will do the treatment
[20:04] I have talked to dad
[20:07] he'll call to fix our wedding date
[20:09] what did you talk about to uncle?
[20:13] whatever had happened here
[20:15] you've told all that uncle?
Adeel, how can you tell such things to uncle about me?
[20:19] if I won't tell him about you, then will I tell him about someone else?
[20:23] he will kill me!
[20:24] you don't feel a bit ashamed though
[20:26] Okay, listen to me
[20:28] I cannot listen to you at all. I have so much of work.
Adeel, I have to go
[20:42] I came to meet you, Zara
[20:44] I'm busy right now, we'll talk later
[20:47] and if Adnan uncle will see, then he'll say something wrong & you'll mind it
[20:51] Saad, why are you giving a chance to others to talk inappropriate about us?
[20:56] give it to me
[21:07] Sarwat
[21:08] yes...
I want to discuss something important with you
[21:10] yes yes, I was just clearing the wardrobe
[21:12] leave the wardrobe. Your brother had just called
[21:16] brother Ahmed? All good?
[21:19] he was talking about Zara & Adeel's wedding date
[21:22] I said, I will go home & take your suggestion...
all of a sudden?
[21:25] I had a word with him day before yesterday, at that time he hadn't said any such thing
[21:31] whatever we wants, he wants the same. So what's the point of all of a sudden in it?
[21:40] what happen, why are you quiet? What are you thinking?
[21:44] I am feeling afraid
[21:47] you must be afraid of Mahi's behavior
[21:49] No... its not about Mahi
[21:52] was sister Fareeda not enough
[21:55] I had thought since Maham is married, so now our Zara will tolerate them
[22:00] but she came back after taking divorce
[22:03] both of them together will make my daughter's life a living hell!
[22:06] what are we about to do?
[22:09] what else can we do except for this?
[22:12] Zara's nuptial vows are done already
[22:14] nothing is left in our hands anymore
[22:19] you should have thought about all this earlier
[22:40] when you & your sister had to decide everything, then what's the need to talk to me?
[22:46] why are you telling me?
[22:49] you can call them not only once but many times, I don't care!
[22:55] we haven't fixed anything as of yet, I've just talked to them about the wedding date
[22:59] and brother Manzoor said he'll let me know after doing suggestion at home
[23:03] So, where am I in this suggestion?
[23:08] Adeel is my son!
[23:10] nobody didn't even bothered to discuss it with me
[23:16] you must be the only Pakistani mother, who isn't happy to know about her son's wedding
[23:23] have some God fear, Fareeda
[23:26] its been too long that Zara & Adeel's nuptial vows were done
[23:30] do you have any idea?
[23:33] how can I forget that wretched day?
[23:36] when you took me to Karachi by making an excuse of your mother's illness
[23:43] after going there, you had wed off Adeel with that wretched Zara forcibly without my consent
[23:49] Adeel's nuptial vows weren't done forcibly
[23:53] its done as per his likeness & consent
[23:57] and that too because of you!
[24:01] so that you cannot create any issues in that relation
[24:05] why are you telling me?
[24:08] as if I don't know yours & your sister's slyness!
[24:14] but let me tell you one thing
[24:18] that now Adeel's wedding will be done whenever I want it to happen
[24:23] Zara will not come in this house as a bride without my consent
[24:28] we'll see that
[24:30] listen to one thing very clearly
[24:34] you cannot control such matters
[24:39] I have already talked to brother Manzoor, & its not a joke
[24:43] brother Manzoor will decide when to do the wedding ceremony
[24:47] and whichever date he will decide, we will do the wedding ceremony on the same date
[24:52] so it would be better for you to start doing the wedding preparations
[24:57] and don't waste your energy on such useless things
[25:02] there is no need to!
[25:04] I don't want to do any preparations, I will not go in the wedding
[25:11] Fine!
[25:13] if you won't go in the wedding then lets do one thing, lets arrange the wedding here
[25:20] believe me! I will convince him to do the wedding in this city
[25:26] Okay, happy now?
[25:51] what's this, you are washing the clothes
[25:54] you don't have time for me, since your in-laws are here
[25:58] are you impressing Mahi by doing work?
[26:02] why will I impress anyone? And that too by washing clothes?
[26:07] by the way, there is no use of such things now
[26:10] you've already got us humiliated because of your romance
[26:15] Saad, what rubbish you are talking?
[26:17] think before saying anything. What will anyone think, if they hear us?
[26:22] who will hear? Mahi?
[26:24] are you talking about Mahi?
[26:26] Saad, you've started again? Go downstairs, I am coming. Go, meet Adeel
[26:32] what do you mean?
[26:35] I came to meet you, Zara
[26:37] I'm busy right now, we'll talk later
[26:40] and if Adnan uncle will see, then he'll say something wrong & you'll mind it
[26:44] Saad, why are you giving a chance to others to talk inappropriate about us?
[26:48] give it to me
[26:53] Okay
[26:55] I've understood
[27:00] Sorry!
[27:04] Saad, listen to me
[27:08] don't call me like this
[27:10] what will anyone say, if they hear us
[27:44] Adeel
[27:47] are you upset?
[27:50] I am not upset but amazed
[27:54] haven't you gone as of yet?
[27:56] you had booked the tickets though
[28:00] I had said it in anger, I wasn't leaving
[28:08] are you going to wear this?
[28:10] why, is it not good?
[28:12] Zara has gifted it
[28:14] if you have an objection then I will not wear it
[28:17] when did I said that? And why will I have an objection?
[28:21] its such a nice shirt
[28:23] but it will look more nice on Saad
[28:27] I mean, it will also suit you a lot if you'll wear it. So wear this one
[28:35] I was asking, around what time we have to go? Is Zara coming along with us?
[28:40] what do you mean?
[28:43] you will also come with us?
[28:44] I came to attend this wedding from so far
[28:48] but if you have a problem then I won't go. I will stay here
[28:52] I don't have any problem
[28:54] really? Then tell me at what time we have to go
[28:59] 8pm
that's fine
[29:01] its 2:30 pm right now, there is still 4 to 5 hours
[29:05] your mood will also be fine by that time, please spit your anger
[29:08] then we'll go together. Ok?
[29:33] you had asked me to see you before leaving
[29:36] yes, kindly bring me a few things. And this is the amount
[29:43] is it urgent? Is it possible if I go later?
[29:46] obviously its urgent that's why I am asking you
[29:49] otherwise, I would have waited for dad to come back or I would have brought it myself
[29:56] Ok, let me bring it
[29:58] why your mood is off?
[30:03] my mood is fine
[30:05] Since you are coming from upstairs, so I hope Adnan uncle haven't said anything to you
[30:14] there are a few people besides brother Adnan
[30:16] who talks like him
[30:21] did aunt Shaista said anything?
[30:25] whoever had said anything, what is the need for you to know?
[30:29] when I have said, I'm fine & my mood is fine. Then I am fine
[30:41] he might have argued with Zara for sure
[30:46] but he said, talks like Adnan uncle. Why will Zara talk like that?
[30:52] Zara will do a lot more, just wait & watch
[30:55] girls like Zara do a lot of things to make their in-laws happy
[31:01] what do you mean?
[31:03] nothing! just eat your food
[31:11] come on, eat your food
[31:24] what are you looking in the mobile?
[31:33] thank God that you've kept the mobile phone away
[31:36] Listen! Zara's in-laws are here
[31:41] I was thinking to invite them on the dinner
[31:47] why shall we invite them?
[31:50] the people who have called them over, don't they have food to feed them?
[31:54] Adnan, we live here. And it won't make any difference if we'll invite them on the dinner
[32:00] we have some responsibility too
[32:02] the people whom they are visiting, whose guests they are. They'll do their dinner
[32:06] they'll invite them for the dinner, why shall we do our expense?
[32:09] the limit!
[32:11] sometimes I feel amazed!
[32:14] we've been living here since so long, and we aren't paying any rent or so. What about that?
[32:22] what do you mean, without paying rent?
[32:24] you used to live downstairs in a separate room, and there is no rent for it
[32:27] no matter you are their distant relative, but still you are their sister
[32:30] what was the need for them to shift you upstairs? After all, there is no rent for living downstairs
[32:34] yes, until I had lived downstairs. I used to live with them
[32:37] I used to eat with them as well
[32:40] you had only sent the rent of 2 months
[32:43] they did so many favors on me
[32:45] otherwise, my own family didn't supported me at all
[32:47] so they should have let us stay downstairs, why did they shifted us upstairs in a portion?
[32:50] you were all alone, nobody else was there
[32:52] you are out of question!
[32:55] our stuff was lying in the upper portion
[32:59] neither they could use it nor they could rent it out
[33:01] that's stupidity
[33:03] but stupid people can never understand this
[33:05] if some place is furnished & it will be rented, then you get hefty rent instead of an unfurnished house
[33:11] but who shall explain this to illiterate people?
[33:13] only you are intelligent, rest all of us are stupid!
[33:18] I am asking you about the dinner, so tell me when shall I invite them?
[33:24] never
[33:26] what do you mean by this?
[33:28] I want to invite them on the dinner & I will
[33:34] Ok fine, call them
[33:37] when shall I invite?
[33:38] the day when Kashmir will be free, invite them on the next day
[33:41] we'll do a grand dinner, everyone will see. Ok?
[33:49] I feel like breaking this mobile phone into small pieces
[33:52] take it
[34:21] brother... brother, your phone is ringing
[34:26] let it be
[34:28] its Zara calling
[34:31] I know
[34:34] give me the phone
[34:38] is there any fight happening between you two?
[34:42] No
[34:43] so why you haven't picked up the phone? Maybe she have some work with you
[34:48] I will talk to her whenever I feel like
[34:52] hmm...
[34:54] it means you guys had fought..
[34:56] it means, when I have told you that there isn't any fight or so. Then there is nothing as such
[35:02] don't repeat the same thing again & again
[35:07] brother, why are you talking to me like this?
[35:13] I have never seen you ignoring Zara's call, that's why I had asked
[35:18] Sorry!
[35:21] there isn't any such thing
[35:26] Saad...
[35:30] Saad dear...
[35:33] yes mom, coming
[36:31] do you like it?
[36:33] yes, its very nice
[36:37] alright then
[36:39] tonight you'll wear the same dress at my friend's wedding
[36:43] with me
[36:45] I will also go?
[36:47] why? Don't you want to come?
[36:50] I haven't said that
[36:53] but...
[36:54] but the main thing is that, I went to uncle before coming here
[36:58] I took permission from him & he doesn't have an objection
[37:01] okay
[37:03] but is it very important to wear alike clothes?
[37:08] its not necessary, but I wanted to do twinning with you
[37:15] but if you don't like then its fine, we won't do
[37:18] I have no problem
[37:20] I will wear these clothes
[37:22] I just need to wear heels for the height
[37:29] your choice is really good, these are very nice clothes
[37:33] it will look more nice when you'll wear them
[37:37] thank you!
[37:41] my pleasure...
[37:51] Wow Zara! its such a nice dress
[37:55] do you know, its my favorite color
[37:57] really?
yes!
[37:59] if you don't mind, then can I wear this dress at the event today?
[38:05] whats wrong? you can say it clearly on my face if you want to refuse. Why are you quiet?
[38:09] No... its not like that. You can wear it
[38:13] sure?
[38:15] Ok tell me, from where you've bought it?
[38:17] I'm thinking to take mom & Mirha as well, maybe they like something
[38:20] Adeel had brought it
[38:23] Oh! Adeel had brought it?
[38:27] Adeel had never brought such an expensive dress for his mom or sister ever
[38:33] anyways leave it, I don't want to wear
[38:36] what if Adeel gets angry with me once again
[38:38] leave it
[38:39] No, Adeel won't mind. You can wear it
[38:42] No no, keep it with you & wear it. He'll get upset with me once again
[38:48] if you are insisting a lot then let me wear it, no problem!
[38:52] but you'll handle Adeel, ok?
[38:57] you know I came in such a hurry, I couldn't even do the shopping
[39:02] and Adeel brings quite a lot of things for you in his bag
[39:06] you can wear anything
[39:08] thank you!
