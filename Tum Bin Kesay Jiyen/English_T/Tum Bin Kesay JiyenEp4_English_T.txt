[00:15] She is not your daughter, Mahi is your daughter.
[00:20] Who is being taunted in that house because of her divorce.
[00:24] And they are considering her as a witch who is creating fuss in their house.
[00:28] Impossible!
[00:30] Those girls can never use such words.
[00:34] You are creating these fake stories.
[00:37] Say sorry to Mahi and end this matter.
[00:40] Dad, how can you force me to apologize without even listening to me. 
[00:44] That was not my fault.
[00:46] I won't apologize.
[00:48] I came here to meet you Zara.
[00:50] I am busy right now. We will talk later.
[00:53] And if uncle Adnan saw and if he will say anything then you will mind.
[00:57] Why do we give others a chance to say nonsense about us.
[01:02] Give me.
[01:14] Zenny, press this dress.
[01:17] Who will wear this?
[01:19] I will wear this.
[01:22] Do it quickly, I am already late and I don't want to get more late.
[01:26] But why are you wearing this one? 
[01:28] Why aren't you wearing that one which brother Adeel has brought for you?
[01:32] Mahi will wear that dress.
[01:35] What?
[01:36] Why is Mahi wearing your dress?
[01:41] It's not the right time to discuss this matter. Press my dress quickly.
[01:45] I am going to get ready. We will talk when I come back.
[01:50] This is not fair.
[02:00] Mom, mark my words.
[02:03] Mahi can't come here without any reason. 
[02:06] She has come here because she wants Adeel and Zara to be separated.
[02:10] God forbid.
[02:11] You just say without thinking.
[02:15] Mom, I am saying it but you were also thinking in the same way.
[02:18] Otherwise you wouldn't ask me to come to you after uncle wanted to fix marriage date.
[02:24] Your dad has clearly said that we can't do anything.
[02:28] When everything is finalized then they can fix the date whenever they want.
[02:31] Hmm.
[02:33] We had no other option other than that.
[02:36] And by the way, Zara has chosen Adeel herself.
[02:40] But if you had asked me then I would have forbidden you.
[02:42] I forbid you but did any one listen to me? No.
[02:47] Mom how can you forget aunt's misbehavior with you? 
[02:51] How rudely she behaved with you.
[02:53] But despite that you accepted their son's proposal for your daughter.
[02:57] I never told anyone about sister-in-law's misbehavior with me
[03:00]  but I forbade Zara and advised her.
[03:04] What would I do, on one hand there was my daughter's happiness
[03:07]  and on the other hand my brother brought that proposal with so much hope.
[03:10] You are right mom but now you will have to find a solution.
[03:14] Why don't you ask Adeel to shift here with us.
[03:18] Not in our house, he can live in separate house.
[03:22] They won't accept this. How can they accept because he is their only son.
[03:27] They wouldn't accept even if he wasn't their only son. 
[03:29] We have to force them to accept such things.
[03:31] Why don't you tell them clearly that we won't arrange Zara's marriage until Adeel doesn't shift to Karachi.
[03:38] And how will we respond that why are we demanding this? Tell me.
[03:42] We will have to do something.
[03:44] We will have to find some solution and by the way we can make any excuse.
[03:51] This is not right thing to do.
[03:53] OK, tell me one thing. What if Zara says all of this to Adeel then?
[03:59] By the way, Adeel doesn't refuse Zara's request.
[04:02] But what if they became angry with each other then?
[04:08] So what.
[04:10] Every wife demands a separate house from her husband after marriage.
[04:13] It's not an unusual thing.
[04:18] I don't know.
[04:20] I don't understand anything.
[04:31] I am leaving in five minutes.
[04:33] I am standing near car and waiting for Zara.
[04:36] OK, I will inform you.
[04:38] OK.
[04:39] Shall we go?
[04:48] What is this?
[04:50] Why did you wear this dress?
[04:53] Actually Maham.
What Maham?
[05:01] Did she forbid you to wear that dress?
[05:03] Why would she forbid me Adeel?
then?
[05:07] Wow Zara, you are looking so beautiful.
[05:09] By the grace of God.
[05:11] You are a beautiful couple.
[05:14] We are getting late. Let's go.
[05:24] Let's go brother. We are getting late.
[06:11] What's wrong with both of you? Why are you so quiet? 
[06:14] Are you angry with each other?
[06:17] No, there is no such thing.
[06:23] OK
[06:24] Zara do one thing, maybe by doing this your mood gets fix. Come to front seat. I will go back.
[06:30] No, I am fine here. Thank you.
What's the matter?
[06:37] Isn't this because of my arrival?
[06:41] By the way, I am feeling as if I am misfit between both of you.
[06:45] Adeel, at least you tell me that what has happened to her?
[06:47] She doesn't say anything because she wants to become a nice sister-in-law.
[06:52] What do you want to listen?
[06:54] Tell me what do you want to listen, I will say that.
[06:58] And I am unable to understand that what are you talking about?
[07:02] And I am sure that Zara mustn't have known about that as well
[07:08] So I was right.
[07:11] Both of you are quiet because of my presence. Right?
[07:14] Sorry brother.
[07:16] I am really sorry. If I had known then I wouldn't come.
[07:41] Mr. Ahmed.
Hmm.
[07:43] Mr. Ahmed, are you aware of anything?
[07:46] Mirha hasn't come back yet from academy.
[07:49] She has been two hours late.
[07:51] Don't worry, she will come back.
[07:54] Maybe she is with her friend.
[07:58] Have you called her?
[08:00] I am calling her continuously but she isn't receiving my call.
[08:04] Please check, where is she. My heart is pounding. May God keep her safe.
[08:11] God forbid.
[08:13] Think before talking Farida.
[08:17] Let me call her.
[08:19] Oh God, keep her safe.
[08:27] Did she receive your call?
[08:30] She is so irresponsible. She isn't receiving my call.
[08:35] I was telling you the same thing that I am calling her continuously but she isn't receiving my call.
[08:43] Go and check in her academy.
[08:46] I will keep calling her and if she will receive my call then I will inform you.
[08:51] Yes, keep calling her and
[08:54] Also call her friends, maybe they know anything about her.
[08:59] I am going there.
[09:01] Don't worry.
[09:03] Everything will be alright. I am going there.
[09:05] OK, go there.
OK.
[09:16] Oh God, have mercy on my daughter.
[09:36] This pair costs hundred rupees.
OK give me.
[09:44] Take it.
Thank you sir.
[09:48] Wear it both of you.
[09:51] Why have you bought these for Zara? Are you mad?
[09:54] Unmarried girls don't wear it.
[09:56] Mom strictly forbids it.
[09:59] She neither let unmarried girls use perfume nor let them wear it.
[10:03] The unseen things effect them. We can't do that.
[10:06] I don't believe on such myths.
[10:08] Your opinion doesn't matter.
[10:11] Elders' sayings are right. Zara can't wear it.
[10:15] What's wrong with you? What are you talking about?
[10:18] No problem Adeel, I don't like it anyway. It's Ok.
[10:24] You argue with me for no reason.
[10:26] Do you know that mom didn't allow me to use perfume and wear it before marriage.
[10:32] If she wears it then mom will definitely scold you. Do you understand?
[10:35] Anyway, as you wish.
[10:39] It's not necessary Adeel. Let's go in.
[10:43] Do one thing Zara, help me wearing it.
[10:50] I have no issues in doing that.
[10:52] But the unseen creatures don't know that whether I hold it because I want to help you wearing it? 
[10:57] What if they attack me then?
[11:00] Mahi, I am very scared. Please do it yourself. Hmm.
[11:05] Yes, she is absolutely right.
[11:09] Let me help you.
[11:12] I will do it myself.
[11:33] Uncle, have you lost your mind? 
What's this nonsense uncle?
[11:36] What happened? I was just joking. I thought that you will think that it's Saad.
[11:39] Stop.
[11:40] I don't like such cheap jokes at all.
[11:43] And as far as Saad is concerned.
[11:45] He can't dare to come this much close to me.
[11:47] I was just.
Stop.
[11:51] Don't do this again.
[11:54] Otherwise I will complain aunt Shaista about it. Just leave it.
[12:00] What happened to you?
[12:03] Crazy girl.
[12:23] What the hell? Why have they bought such expensive phones?
[12:29] Adeel is not receiving my call.
[12:31] Mahi isn't receiving my call as well. 
[12:32] I don't know, in which condition my daughter is in. She never got that much late.
[12:38] Mr. Ahmed.
[12:40] Is she alright? Where is she? Why hasn't she come
[12:43] She has got an accident. I just got a call from hospital.
[12:46] We will have to reach there immediately.
[12:48] Oh my God.
[12:50] Did you see?
[12:52] That's why I was afraid, I told you that I dreamed.
[12:56] Despite that you sent Adeel to Karachi.
[12:59] Now my daughter has got an accident.
[13:02] That was a dream and this is reality.
[13:05] My dreams come true Mr. Ahmed.
[13:08] Don't you know about that.
[13:11] If anything happened to my daughter Mr. Ahmed then I will not spare that Zara.
[13:16] What's nonsense? Such accident can happen to anyone. It's not Zara's fault.
[13:22] It's Zara's fault.
[13:24] It's her fault. That girl is not suitable for my house.
[13:28] You just discussed about her wedding.
[13:31] My daughter got such a big accident. If she came to this house then God knows what will happen.
[13:36] You are just saying nonsense.
[13:39] It's just illiteracy.
[13:40] It's not illiteracy, it's reality but I don't know why you can't see this.
[13:45] Your niece has bad omen for us. That's why I am calling her that.
[13:51] Tell me that will you keep saying this or will go with me?
[13:55] Yes. My daughter.
[13:57] My daughter... Mirha
[14:02] Please go from here.
[14:04] What do you mean, do I leave you in this condition?
[14:07] If my family members saw you then they will ask me about you. What will I tell them?
[14:12] Tell them that we are class fellows.
[14:14] And what was I doing with you on your bike?
[14:17] You told me that your family is very broad minded.
[14:19] Not that much that they don't ask me this question.
[14:23] Please go to your bed. Doctor is coming on round.
[14:47] Aqib please go from here now.
[14:49] OK, let the x-ray report come.
[14:53] Then I will leave.
[14:54] I will inform you about report on phone.
[14:57] So please go now.
[14:58] OK, at least let your family come. I am waiting outside.
[15:02] I will stay here until your family doesn't come.
Aqib.
[15:08] Keep quiet. OK. You get worried for no reason.
[15:13] Please take rest. Relax.
[15:46] Greetings.
Greetings.
[15:48] My daughter has got an accident and she is admitted in this hospital.
[15:50]  Her name is Mirha.
Let me check.
[15:56] She is in room 111, it's right there.
Thank you.
[16:08] I told mom that Zara should impose a condition on Adeel to shift to Karachi.
[16:15] By the way, what do you think? Will Zara do that?
[16:19] She will say that such relations can't be maintained based on such conditions.
[16:23] And what do you think.
[16:25] There is nothing wrong with it.
[16:28] If she will live with her in-laws then she won't live happily.
[16:31] You are also trying to do the same thing for a long time. Right?
[16:34] But what did you get? Nothing.
[16:37] Rather the matter has become more worse.
[16:40] You again taunted me Zenny.
[16:42] I am not taunting you.
[16:44] I am telling you the truth. 
[16:46] This is the centuries old tradition.
[16:48] Girls go to their in-laws' house after getting married.
[16:52] And in our culture, son-in-law who lives in her wife's house considered as a cursed man.
[16:56] What do you want to say?
[16:59] I want to tell you that don't give such advises to Zara.
[17:03] She will never agree with you.
[17:37] Adeel
[17:39] Why have you asked me to come here?
[17:41] As you know that Mahi is with me and she can mind.
[17:45] You didn't answer my question.
[17:47] Mahi forbade you to wear that dress. Right?
[17:50] Tell me the truth.
[17:51] But why is that dress that much important to you?
[17:54] That your mood is off because I didn't wear that dress.
[17:57] Zara, we can't respond everything out of emotions.
[18:00] Even you didn't respond my question. 
[18:03] Ain't I looking good to you in this dress?
[18:07] This is not the case Zara.
[18:09] I like you in any dress and outfit and you know it very well.
[18:14] And I also know that you can't be angry with me for a long time.
[18:19] Please end this anger and fix your mood.
[18:23] Please
[18:27] You know what
[18:29] I wanted to come here alone with you.
[18:32] And I know that you must be feeling uncomfortable because of her presence.
[18:35] There is nothing like that Adeel.
[18:37] She is your sister. Why would I feel uncomfortable because of her? I am fine.
[18:42] Adeel.
[18:43] You are standing here. I am searching you for a long time.
[18:46] Why? What happened?
I want to go home.
[18:49] I want to go home, right now right away.
[18:50] Why so suddenly like this? Is everything alright?
[18:53] Mirha has got an accident
[19:03] Let's go.
[19:23] Oh my God. What happened to my daughter? How are you?
[19:29] Stop crying, we are here. God will do things better.
[19:36] I was calling you continuously. Why was your phone switched off
[19:40] You should have informed us by calling us.
[19:42] Mom my phone was dropped down during accident and I don't know where is that.
[19:47] Oh God.
[19:49] Tell me the truth, did mobile snatchers beat you and fell you down.
[19:55] No mom, I got an accident.
[19:57] Listen to me.
[19:58] Do this investigation later. Be thankful that she is safe. Be thankful to God.
[20:08] What are you talking about Mr. Ahmed.
[20:11] My daughter has got an accident and she is injured 
[20:14] but you are saying that no problem and I should be thankful.
[20:17] I have talked to doctor, he told me that she will be fully recovered within a few days.
[20:23] Why are you bothering her for no reason.
[20:25] Whatever
[20:27] I am a mother and I can't see her in this condition, 
[20:31] I can't see any of my child in this condition
[20:33] OK OK. Let me talk to doctor. You stay here.
[20:44] Tell me the truth, what happened?
[20:47]  You have fallen down from motorcycle. Right?
[20:49] Who was with you on motorcycle?
[20:51] Mom, no one was with me. I was alone.
[20:54] Really?
[20:57] Yes. And who told you that I was with someone.
[21:01] It's obvious that you have fallen down from motorcycle and got injured. 
[21:05] Someone was riding that motorcycle.
[21:08] Mom I was standing alone and waiting for bus then a biker hit me.
[21:14] Are you telling me the truth?
Yes mom.
[21:32] The medical staff of hospital told me that there was also a boy with Mirha.
[21:38] Yes, Mirha told me about it earlier.
[21:42] That boy hit our Mirha.
[21:45] He fell down himself and also injured our daughter.
[22:03] Drive fast Adeel. What are you doing? 
[22:07] I don't know, in which condition Mirha must be in.
[22:09] I have talked to dad and they have also sent me reports. There is nothing to worry.
[22:14] Everything will be alright. Don't worry.
[22:16] Why don't I get worried?
[22:18] You mustn't got worried but I am worried.
[22:22] She is my younger sister. I don't know, what is her condition?
[22:25] She has got an accident. It's not a joke.
[22:28] Did you see Zara.
[22:29] He doesn't care for his sisters at all. 
[22:32] Does he do the same thing with you?
[22:34] Why would you say anything because Adeel is very nice in front of you.
[22:41] Adeel please drive carefully and sister please take care, Adeel is driving.
[22:45] I haven't held his hands. I am just asking him to drive fast.
[22:54] Mom is crying continuously. Mirha is admitted in hospital.
[22:57] But you are worried about Adeel only.
[23:00] I couldn't even think that you turned out to be like this.
[23:05] You are only connected to Adeel, you have no relation with us.
[23:13] I didn't consider you like this Zara.
[23:16] I didn't say any such thing. I just want to say that you can discuss this matter when we will reach home.
[23:20]  Don't discuss this matter in car.
[23:22] Don't make any fuss in car.
[23:24] Do you want to say this?
I didn't say any such thing.
[23:27] Complete your sentence. You wanted to say that I should make any fuss.
[23:38] And you, focus on your driving.
[23:42] She seems same in mirror as she is in reality.
[23:46] God forbid if we got an accident then you will blame me.
[23:49] She has already said that I am bothering driver so much.
[23:53] But no one knows
[23:55] That driver was not focusing on traffic, he was focusing on someone's eyes.
[24:58] OK, OK, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I won't spare you.
[25:23] Uncle, have you lost your mind? What's this nonsense, uncle?
[25:52] Did you see Mr. Ahmed.
[25:54] My daughter got such a big accident but we didn't receive a single call from Karachi.
[25:59] Neither your sister called us nor your brother-in-law.
[26:03] They don't know anything.
[26:05] Mahi only informed Adeel.
Really?
[26:09] And don't you know that your son tells everything to Zara.
[26:13] He didn't call us as well.
[26:15] I have forbidden Adeel that don't tell anyone about it.
[26:20] And by the way, Zara, Adeel and Mahi are attending wedding function.
[26:25] They are enjoying so let them enjoy. Why do we bother them for no reason.
[26:31] Thank God that accident was not severe and she will discharged very shortly.
[26:37] Let me tell you one thing Mr. Ahmed.
[26:40] If anyone calls from Karachi Mirha will reach home
[26:46]  then I won't talk to anyone.
OK, don't talk to anyone.
[26:53] Oh God, my daughter's foot is fractured.
[26:58] And no one bothers about her.
[27:00] Sir you can take her home by paying bill at reception.
[27:03] OK my child. Thank you.
[27:06] Stay here, let me pay the bill.
[27:14] Oh God, aren't you feeling pain.
[27:40] What's the matter? Why is your mood off? Is everything alright?
[27:45] As if you don't know anything.
[27:49] I will know if you will tell me. What's the matter, tell me.
[27:53] Why don't you understand?
[27:57] Mahi and Adeel will go back after few days.
[28:02] How much their dinner will cost?
[28:05] And I know that you can afford the cost of dinner for four people, you have spent a long time abroad.
[28:13] You take minor things seriously.
[28:16] I was just joking. What's wrong with you.
[28:19] Do one thing, go there in the morning and invite all children for dinner tomorrow.
[28:25] Are you serious?
Yes.
[28:28] This is the problem with you that you treat my lie as truth and my truth as lie.
[28:34] OK, listen
[28:37] I was thinking about one more thing. 
[28:39] Just like Adeel is son-in-law of that family, Saad is also son-in-law of that house.
[28:44] So, what about inviting Saad's family? What do you say?
[28:48] Invite them, why are you asking me?
[28:52] You are asking minor things from me. 
[28:55] Your husband is not that much bad as you think about him.
[28:58] There is no such thing.
[29:00] I didn't say that.
[29:02] Yes you didn't say that but I can feel this from your face.
[29:07] It's my habit to be jolly with people but
[29:12] But how would you know because I have spent so much time abroad.
[29:16] I do joke with people but now I have decided that I will change my habit.
[29:21] And I will keep myself quiet.
[29:23] Why will you keep quiet? I didn't say that.
[29:26] You didn't say anything but I can assume from your face expression.
[29:30] I want you to be happy and smiling but...
But what?
[29:37] But the environment of your brother's house is very awkward.
[29:41] If I talk in a jolly mood with anyone then I feel as if they mind that
[29:46]  because they are not habitual of such behavior so
[29:48] I have decided that from now on I won't do that with them and I will change my habit.
[29:57] Has anyone said something to you?
[29:58] No, no one has said anything, I am just thinking.
[30:02] That if I say anything to anyone then he can extract some other meanings from that and tell you something else to you.
[30:06] Then the situation becomes awkward so that's why...
[30:09] Adnan, there is no such thing.
[30:12] You are my husband.
[30:14] Will I blindly trust anyone if he says that your husband has done this and that?
[30:19] Not at all. There is a trust bond between husband and wife.
[30:24] I expected this from you.
[30:27] You trust me that much. Right?
[30:30] You will know everything on right time. Eat meal.
Take this salad.
[30:35] Eat. Take hot bread.
No, you eat.
[30:39] Take hot food.
[30:42] You aren't eating. Take it.
[30:46] I don't know anything.
[30:48] I want to go to Hyderabad right now right away.
[30:50] What happened my child, wait till morning.
[30:53] How will I able to pass this night?
[30:55] Have you thought about mom, uncle?
[30:58] How will she take care of Mirha alone?
[31:00] Adeel do something, book tickets, we have to go back right now.
[31:04] Uncle is absolutely right. We will leave early morning.
[31:08] I don't think that you will be able to get any ticket at this time.
[31:12] We won't allow you to go right now, there are so many mishaps in the city.
[31:17] If God forbid.
[31:18] God forbid, if Zara would have married to Adeel
[31:21] And she would be in Hyderabad in same situation, would you say the same thing even then aunt.
[31:26] That how will you book ticket, city situation is not good. I don't know, what happened to you.
[31:30] If you want to go then just go Maham but don't say such useless things about Zara.
[31:38] I am just giving an example.
[31:40] Why don't everyone understand my point?
[31:44] We shouldn't give such examples. Some time it happens.
[31:49] Aunt, please forgive me.
[31:51] I made mistake by giving wrong example. Please forgive me.
[31:56] Adeel, I am going to pack up my things. Please make all arrangements, 
[31:58] we will go to Hyderabad right now. I have to go to my sister right now.
[32:02] Maham, listen to me.
[32:06] Oho.
[32:08] I apologize to all of you on behalf of sister Maham.
[32:14] She is so sensitive and she behaves like this on minor things that's why.
[32:19] Not sensitive, she is so lowly.
[32:22] It would be better for you to take her back.
[32:25] Maheen, keep quiet.
[32:31] Where is my phone?
[32:33] It's in the room. Bring that.
[32:36] No, I will take it myself.
[32:45] How did it happen so suddenly?
[32:49] Bring tea for brother.
[32:56] Let me check whether he has called them or not.
[33:26] I don't know why Mahi hasn't reached yet.
[33:29] Adeel needs any excuse to stay there.
[33:33] They know that their sister has got an accident but they haven't reached yet.
[33:48] The medical staff of hospital told me that
[33:54] There was also a boy with Mirha.
[33:56] Yes, Mirha told me about him.
[34:00] That boy hit our Mirha.
[34:03] He fell down himself and injured our daughter as well.
[34:07] Mirha was waiting for her bus there.
[34:20] What are you thinking?
[34:23] Nothing.
[34:25] Nothing
[34:27] Do you think that Mirha is lying?
[34:31] Are you suspicious about her?
[34:34] Well, I have just asked you whether you know about it or not.
[34:39] There is no point of doubting her.
[34:42] Your words doesn't suggest that but your tone does.
[34:48] The way you have asked me about it
[34:51] I didn't like your tone.
[34:53] My daughter got a big accident and you are doubting her. That's wrong.
[35:01] Look
[35:02] I am responsible for what I have said not for what you have understood.
[35:09] Why would I doubt her?
[35:12] If there will be any such thing then I will ask her one on one.
[35:16] And I have complete right to do that.
[35:19] So you should have asked her, why are you investigating me?
[35:24] This is not fair. No matter who makes mistakes, you blame me for that.
[35:32] She is crazy.
[35:35] Our children have grown up but she hasn't become wise enough.
[35:48] Dad, your phone.
[35:52] To whom are you calling?
[36:30] What's up uncle?
How are you Saad?
[36:34] Is everything alright uncle?
I need your help my son.
[36:39] Maham and Adeel have to go back immediately.
[36:43] Can you arrange a car?
[36:47] At this time? Is everything alright?
[36:50] Yes, everything is alright. Nothing to worry about.
[36:53] It's required immediately. Will you be able to arrange that
[36:58] Uncle, it's difficult to arrange right now, what if I arrange in the morning?
[37:01] No my son, we can't wait till morning in that case I would have called you in the morning.
[37:07] It's required immediately.
[37:09] OK, let me try then I will call you back.
[37:13] OK, I am waiting for your call.
OK good bye.
[37:31] Car will be arranged. Go and pack your things.
[37:37] Right dad.
[38:09] Bring tea for him before he leaves.
[38:13] OK, let me get it
