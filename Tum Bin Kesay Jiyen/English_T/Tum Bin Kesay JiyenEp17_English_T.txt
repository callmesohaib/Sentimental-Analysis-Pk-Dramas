[00:21] He's his fiance, it's his right.
[00:24] This would only increase their chemistry which is good for their future.
[00:31] But Saad's friendship with Zara is...
[00:34] quite weird.
[00:37] That's what I said to brother.
[00:39] I don't like it at all.
My God! Twenty five lac rupees.
[00:44] What will they do with this hefty sum of money?
[00:50] Firstly they will go on their honeymoon.
[00:52] They can do whatever they want.
She is repeating what she said there.
[00:57] She wanted me to see Zara's face...
[01:01] I saw her face when we got married. We married her according to her choice.
[01:06] What's her problem?
Enough sister, why are you being angry?
[01:20] Sir... please buy these flower bangles. It's two hundred a pair.
[01:24] I need to buy medicine for my mother.
[01:33] Sure.
[01:40] For you.
Thank you.
[01:43] How much did you say?
Two hundred*
[01:52] Here you are...
Sir, I don't have any change.
[01:54] Keep it.
[01:56] It will come handy when treating your mother.
[01:57] Thank you sir. May God bless you two.
[02:01] Amen.
[02:04] Son... listen to me...
[02:09] This is my card.
[02:13] I'm a doctor, bring your mother to my clinic, I'll treat her for free.
[02:18] Will you treat my mother for free?
[02:21] Yes, I will.
[02:24] Go on now.
May God bless you.
[02:34] Shall we?
[03:02] Don't you like flowers?
[03:08] You shouldn't have bought it?
[03:11] Why? Did I buy them for you to take a look at?
[03:16] If not, then let me put it on you.
[03:22] I'll wear it when I reach home.
[03:25] Why would you wear them at home?
[03:28] Auntie doesn't like it.
[03:32] Who told you that?
[03:34] Maheen said if one wear them in public then they might be cursed by a demon.
[03:39] Maybe you are forgetting
[03:41] that Maheen said this when single women wear these.
[03:47] Because even demons have the respect to not go following married women.
[03:52] But if anything like that were to happen...
[03:55] then you can tell them that you're married. And that I'm married
[03:59] angry man who isn't afraid of fighting.
[04:02] What are you saying?
[04:04] What I'm saying is that you should stop being afraid of mother's anger.
[04:08] Meaning?
[04:10] Meaning, my mother's anger is like your love. It comes and goes instantly.
[04:19] Shall we leave now? We actually have to go and
get the phone. It won't be delivered to us.
[04:27] Let's go.
[04:55] Thank you so much. You take care of everyone so much.
[05:00] They are my family, I have to take care of them.
[05:03] When Mirha gets her new phone...
[05:07] she'll be so happy.
[05:08] I'm sure she will since you are gifting it to her.
[05:16] Sir, will you have tea? Should I bring it for you?
[05:19] Sure... tell me, is miss Razia home?
[05:25] Sir... she came just a while ago.
[05:28] Alright? What about Zaviar?
[05:30] He left early in the morning.
[05:33] Do one thing... bring me tea in the lounge.
Sure sir.
[05:51] I want to talk to you
[05:53] Go ahead I'm listening.
[05:57] I went to visit Dolly.
[05:59] So, what did she say?
[06:03] She told me that your behavior isn't good with her.
[06:07] What did you tell her?
[06:09] What could have I told her?
[06:12] You should have asked her why she was saying this.
[06:16] She said that at Zara's wedding you didn't treat her well.
[06:22] What? She told you that. Didn't you ask her...
[06:26] how dare she slander me? Why didn't you ask her this?
[06:32] What could I have told her?
[06:34] That means that you believe that she's telling the truth.
[06:38] Why do you believer her? She could lie
[06:42] Why would she lie?
[06:44] Then why would I treat her badly?
[06:47] It would be better that you answer me.
[06:51] What animosity do I have towards her?
[06:53] You will get your answer, once you answer this question.
[06:59] Wait... where are you going?
[07:02] I want an answer. Do you really think...
[07:08] that I treated her badly?
[07:12] No...
[07:15] Ali... listen to me...
[07:18] Ali...
[07:21] What happened to him?
[07:24] He didn't listen to me. Did you say something to him?
[07:26] What do you mean I said something?
[07:30] He was standing here that's why I'm asking you what happened.
[07:35] Mother, what can I say? I didn't talk to him about anything that would make him react like this.
[07:41] You two were standing here. He left without responding me.
[07:45] I'm asking you because you were standing here.
[07:48] Did you say something to him?
[07:49] I didn't say anything to him. What do you want from me?
[07:53] I'm right in front of you making my salad.
[07:59] Focus on working and keep people away from the sharpness of your tongue.
[08:04] Really, then do one thing, take this and cut out my tongue.
[08:08] Maybe then you'll be relieved.
[08:12] But let me tell you something. Even the people who can't speak have a language.
[08:15] They can say a lot, even without saying anything.
[08:19] It's pointless talking to you. Did you talk to Zara?
No.
[08:26] After her wedding, this is the first time she's left home. Thank God...
[08:30] that auntie didn't tag along with them.
[08:32] Your aunt isn't foolish enough to go out with them.
[08:36] She's quite skeptical and can cause a lot of trouble.
[08:40] Don't say such things.
[08:43] Only eight days have passed since their marriage, may God keep them happy.
[08:47] I didn't say anything. You started it.
[08:53] Forgive me, I asked by mistake.
[08:56] Now hurry up, your father will be here any moment now.
[09:00] Sure.
[09:10] Hey you're back and you didn't even tell me.
[09:18] Keep it here.
You can go.
[09:25] What's the matter Alam? Don't say such things in front of servants.
[09:30] They have a habit of exaggerating things
[09:35] Where did you go?
[09:36] I went to a friend's house who had arranged a kitty party.
[09:44] When did you come from finishing your work?
[09:46] I've been back for a while now.
[09:49] I was in my study room.
You and your study.
[09:52] You can try giving me some time as well.
[09:54] I will.
[09:55] I will give you some time as well.
But you're busy somewhere else right now
[10:00] Yes you know very well.
[10:03] Like how you partake in doing social work, similarly I like partaking in social gatherings.
[10:11] Mr. Alam, I wanted to talk to you.
Sure.
[10:15] Go ahead, what is it?
[10:19] I wanted to tell you that the land in Hyderabad...
[10:23] What do you think about selling that land to buy a house in Karachi?
[10:30] What? How is it possible? What are you saying?
[10:36] You're asking me to sell that land.
[10:40] Yes, what's so wrong with that?
[10:44] And do you know that everyone in the party was discussing...
[10:48] that how they can save their money by buying a house at a good place in Karachi.
[10:52] Besides, what will we do with that land.
[10:55] Neither you or Zaviar have time. Who will look after it?
[11:00] I think the best option is to sell that land and buy...
[11:06] a bungalow in Karachi.
Strange...
[11:09] It's been three years since we left Karachi and you...
[11:15] still haven't forgotten it.
[11:18] Karachi isn't a place your forget.
[11:21] We've spent a long time together there. We got married there as well.
[11:27] How can we forget Karachi?
[11:29] We spend good times there, we have so many fond memories there.
[11:35] We can't forget them. What's so wrong with leaving this place?
[11:41] Look, the people here needs educated people like us.
[11:50] So that we can teach them about this world and also our religion.
[11:54] God has given us that capability...
[11:57] We should be thankful of God...
You and your good intentions...
[12:03] Tell me, are you selling that land or not?
[12:06] I cannot make any decision without talking to Zaviar.
[12:11] What need is there to ask Zaviar?
His mother...
[12:15] bought that land for Zaviar. I have to ask him.
[12:20] I don't understand what you're saying. Don't we have any rights over Zaviar?
[12:25] Look, looking after something doesn't make it yours...
[12:32] and I cannot be unlawful towards anyone's possession.
[12:36] Do one thing, there is no need for you to talk to Zaviar. I'll talk to him.
[12:42] Drink your tea.
[12:46] Thank you.
[12:55] Enough Mr. Ahmad. You care about your petty accounts.
[13:01] I'm saying something to you. Listen to me
[13:06] You're talking to the wrong person.
[13:10] What you're saying has nothing to do with me. It's his problem and he should resolve it himself.
[13:16] What should I talk to Adeel about? He will try to find a solution for this in his medical text books.
[13:23] Make him understand, he just got married. He should come back home before sunset.
[13:31] There are a thousand bad things that can happen outside.
[13:34] And that girl doesn't have the habit of putting a veil over her head.
[13:40] Alright fine. I'll talk to them when they come back.
Very kind of you.
[13:49] But there is one little problem.
[13:55] What's the problem with this?
[13:58] What if they ask me...
[14:02] about the women who live abroad, who don't wear veils and scarves. And how they don't find themselves attached to demons?
[14:08] What will I answer them?
I don't care.
[14:12] Women who are abroad aren't Muslims. So are the demons.
[14:20] What difference does it make if they cover their heads or not.
[14:25] It's enough for them if they were complete clothes.
[14:30] If you don't want to talk then let me know.
[14:36] If something happens tomorrow, no one will say anything to you tomorrow.
[14:40] The people will taunt me that I didn't teach the kids anything.
[14:44] That's why I'm saying this to you.
[14:49] I do have a solution for this.
[14:54] What?
Why don't you buy a fully body burqa for Zara?
[15:02] Have that made for her.
[15:04] She'll wear it before leaving home. That way she'll be safe.
[15:11] Instead of a shuttlecock burqa, shouldn't I buy her a disappearing cap?
[15:16] That way I wouldn't be able to see her.
Did you say anything?
[15:21] No. Keep managing your accounts.
[15:26] I'll do the rest myself. Let your son and his wife come back.
[15:33] You won't be able to do anything.
[15:40] God have mercy.
[17:37] Tea.
[17:54] If you hadn't come today it would have been the third day.
[18:00] Were you missing me?
[18:03] I was wondering...
[18:06] whether or not you'd be coming here.
[18:13] Why are you saying that?
[18:16] Because Zara has left.
[18:20] You think that I only came here because of Zara.
[18:24] I said no such thing.
[18:29] You also didn't say what you wanted to.
[18:32] I don't want to say anything.
[18:41] Are you upset with me?
[18:45] If I get upset with you...
[18:49] then what will you do to cheer me up?
[18:53] What will I do?
[18:57] I'll jump off the roof. I'll die but I'll cheer you up.
[19:01] If you say such things I'll throw you off the roof.
[19:07] And I won't let you die.
[19:12] Saad... it is possible...
[19:17] that you don't need to cheer me up.
[19:22] That can only happen if you don't get upset with me.
[19:29] That can only happen when you don't let me cry.
[19:54] I promise you...
[19:58] that I will never let you break.
[20:29] Drink your tea.
[20:31] I don't know if it's good or not because Zara didn't make it today.
[20:41] It's very good.
[20:48] Thank you.
[21:04] God rest your grandmother's soul, I didn't leave this house for a month.
[21:13] But men and women nowadays don't care at all. They are out with each other, hand in hand.
[21:32] Saad...
[21:34] Yes...
Wait, I want to talk to you
[21:39] What is it?
Look...
[21:43] Send Dolly my message.
[21:45] Tell her If she has a problem with me then she should talk to me.
[21:51] Stop complaining about me to Ali. She won't gain anything by doing that.
[21:59] What do you mean? Did she say something?
[22:02] She'll tell you that. I just wanted to give you this message.
[22:06] Farewell.
[23:58] Greetings.
Tell me you two...
[24:02] Is this anytime to come back home?
[24:07] I've been waiting for so long... do you guys care?
[24:14] You knew mother.
I did.
[24:18] But I didn't know that you would spend the entire evening outside.
[24:23] I told you that you two just got married and to return home before sunset.
[24:30] No one in this house listens to me. I was getting so many bad feelings.
[24:38] Why are you looking at her? I'm telling you...
[24:43] What will she tell you?
[24:46] When I got married...
[24:48] got have mercy on your grandmother's soul, I didn't step out for a month.
[24:58] But the men and women nowadays, may God have mercy!
[25:02] They don't care, they are out with each other, hand in hand.
[25:11] What is this?
[25:13] Why are you wearing this? God help you! Do you want demons latching on to you?
[25:22] You just got married, one shouldn't wear this.
[25:26] Did your mother teach you anything before sending you here?
[25:35] Mother doesn't believe in this. Before sending us out...
[25:40] she just prays for our well being, but if you don't like them I'll take them off.
[25:48] Wait Zara.
[25:54] There is no need for you to take them off.
[26:01] What's the matter with you mother?
[26:03] What are you saying? People with weak faith say such things.
[26:10] And I've never seen or heard that newly married couples can't go outside.
[26:15] As far as flowers are concerned, they can be found in a lot of places.
[26:21] Are you saying that demons are everywhere? What are you saying?
[26:26] If you haven't seen anything, or you don't know it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
[26:33] My mother used to say that Kumar was married in old Dehli
[26:38] and every evening he used to seat his bride on a donkey and...
[26:42] For God's sake mother, enough!
[26:46] People might have believed in this in the past, but people don't anymore.
[26:55] I don't even know what you're talking about.
[26:58] It's alright Adeel. If mother doesn't like it...
[27:03] I'll take these off...
Zara.
[27:15] Do you know what my mother taught me? She taught me to respect my elders.
[27:23] She said that even if you're at a loss, I should listen to my elders.
[27:28] Even if you don't like it.
[27:53] Do you see? Why are you still standing there, listening?
[27:58] She said so much and you didn't say a single word to her!
[28:06] Is this all the respect I have in this home?
[28:37] Since you've started walking, start doing your work.
[28:41] I've brought these from the roof... fold them!
[28:43] I didn't ask you to take these off? You brought them on your own.
[28:46] If I hadn't the birds would have spoiled them and I would have to wash them again.
[28:52] Fold them!
[28:53] Why are you talking to me like that nowadays?
[28:56] Just because you do chores for me?
[28:58] You know very well why I'm talking to you like this.
[29:01] Why are you interacting so much with Zara?
[29:04] Mother and I don't talk to her without reason. Then why do you?
[29:08] I don't go to her, she comes to me.
And why does she?
[29:12] And you're so stupid that you can't see. She is using you to manipulate Adeel.
[29:18] But you're a fool and you don't understand anything.
[29:21] What have I done Mahi?
[29:24] You don't know what you've done?
I could hear you two laughing all night yesterday.
[29:31] You've become such good friend's right?
[29:36] Mahi...
Shut up!
[29:38] I don't like you being friends with Zara.
[29:42] Distance yourself from her, otherwise it will take me no time to set you straight.
[29:49] That unfaithful lover of yours...
[29:52] I haven't told anyone about him.
[29:55] Are you blackmailing me?
[29:58] I'm not blackmailing you. I'm trying to make you understand, so understand.
[30:04] Your problem is with Zara, so why are you saying this to me?
[30:09] There's a famous saying... the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[30:18] Under the current situation, it's very funny.
[30:22] Because I have my enemy's secret.
[30:27] Do you understand?
[30:29] Distance yourself from Zara, otherwise you won't be able to forget what I do with you.
[31:27] Brother, you're back early?
[31:30] Yes, why?
You never come back so early.
[31:36] Is it because Zara isn't there?
[31:38] Who told you there that I went there just for Zara?
[31:41] Really, then why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
[31:47] Where's mother?
She just went to sleep. Should I bring tea for you?
[31:52] I had tea before I came home.
[31:56] Tell me, did Ali come here?
[32:00] Ali didn't come here, why?
[32:04] No, I was just asking. He wasn't there, so I thought he was here.
[32:09] No... he didn't come here today.
[32:12] Is everything alright at home? Is Zara happy?
[32:17] She's happy... Adeel is there to keep her happy.
[32:21] Zara isn't there, I'm sure you miss her, that's why you came back early.
[32:27] Who told you that I'm missing her?
[32:30] I can see it on your face.
[32:35] It's not like that.
[32:38] I had something to take care of that's why I came home early.
[32:43] Really....
Let mother know that I'll be back home late at night.
[32:48] Okay.
[33:25] Zaviar my son!
Yes aunty.
[33:28] My dear... you're still up.
[33:32] I can see that you've been returning home late, from work.
[33:35] Is everything alright?
[33:36] We have an important project at work and the deadline is near.
[33:42] I want to complete that project. Did you have something for me?
[33:47] Oh yes, I forgot. I came to talk to you about something important.
[33:52] Sure, what is it?
[33:54] Zaviar, I have never differed between you, Farah and Aryan.
Of course.
[34:01] But ever since Aryan has married abroad your uncle has been a broken shell of a man.
[34:07] He isn't strong like he used to be.
[34:11] I don't want him working anymore.
[34:14] He's old as well, how much more will be manage alone?
[34:18] I ask uncle the same thing as well.
[34:21] Talk to your uncle and make him understand.
[34:24] Ask him to sell the land in Hyderabad.
Pardon?
[34:28] Do you object?
No I don't, but mother...
[34:35] I know your mother gave you that land. But time has changed.
[34:41] That place doesn't have the same value as it did before.
[34:45] I advice you to sell that land and find a place in Karachi.
[34:51] But auntie, only uncle can take that decision.
[34:54] I've never interfered in such things.
[34:58] Uncle has always looked after them.
[35:00] It's settled then. I'll convince your uncle.
[35:04] You have no objections, right?
[35:06] No I don't...
[35:09] Bless you, I expected this of you. You never say no.
[35:15] It's very late, you should rest now.
[35:27] Who is it?
[35:30] It's me Mirha.
Sister...
[35:34] Look at this.
[35:37] Look what I brought you.
What did you buy?
[35:40] Look.
[35:42] You bought a mobile for me! 
[35:46] Thank yo so much! You're the best!
[35:54] What is it?
[35:57] Thank you...
[35:59] I should be the one thanking you. Thank you!
[36:04] When you talked to brother Adeel about my phone, did he say something to you?
[36:12] No, what could he have possibly said?
[36:16] I'm sorry... you must be tired. You should rest.
[36:21] I was reading, a bunch of work has piled up during my time off.
[36:24] Go ahead and study then. If you need anything, let me know.
[36:30] Thank you.
[36:31] It's okay.
[36:57] Did you give Mirha the phone?
Yes I did.
[37:01] Alright. How did she like it?
[37:04] You should have told her that you were the one who bought her the phone.
[37:07] For us, all that matters is Mirha's happiness.
[37:10] What difference does it make if you give her the phone or I do.
[37:14] Yes, you're right about that.
[37:20] You've started to mold yourself in my colors.
[37:23] Shall I say one thing?
[37:28] You shouldn't have talked to mother like that.
[37:31] You shouldn't have answered her like that. I was talking to her.
[37:37] I just said it to auntie. I'm sorry if you didn't like it. I'll apologize to her as well.
[37:45] What do you mean?!
[37:47] I'll apologize, I'll apologize to auntie as well.
[37:53] Listen to me... I was joking.
[37:58] Why are you getting so serious?
[38:00] Your joke scared the life out of me.
[38:07] Don't say that again.
[38:11] I pray that you get my life as well.
Adeel!
[38:16] Whatever you said to mother was right.
[38:20] I don't know why mother exaggerates everything. We weren't that late.
[38:26] It's nothing Adeel. All she said was out of worry.
[38:30] Moving forward we'll be careful. We won't stay out late.
[38:34] What do you mean?
[38:37] I'm here, I'll talk to father.
[38:41] He'll make her understand.
[38:42] You won't say anything to uncle. I don't want things to be blown out of proportions.
[38:48] Alright fine, I won't. I promise.
[38:56] You could at least wear these.
[39:00] There aren't any demons around here.
[39:08] I know I'm very bad at putting these on, but I'm trying.
[39:18] See.
[39:23] Perfect.
Thank you.
[39:25] My pleasure.
[39:27] They look very nice.
[39:28] They're pretty, but not more than you.
