[04:42] Mahi? Where are you going?
[04:45] I'm going to my friend Kashaf's. I'll be back in the evening.
[04:49] Alright. Wait a minute. I'm bringing money.
[04:52] Drop me at Rabiya's house on way and pick me up on your way back.
[04:56] Mom, whats wrong. You go yourself. I cannot take you.
[05:00] Why can't you? Whats wrong? They both live on the same route.
[05:04] Mom, why are you being stubborn? You're never stubborn. Whats wrong?
[05:09] Whats wrong with you? I didn't say anything that you're getting so worked up.
[05:12] If you don't want to take me along, thats a different thing.
[05:14] No. Its not that.
[05:16] Come along.
[05:18] No. I don't want to go with this face of yours.
[05:22] Mom, whats wrong? Why are you making my mood go bad?
[05:24] I'm leaving the house after so many days and you're putting me in a bad mood.
[05:29] Alright. I'm not spoiling your mood. Go. I'm fine.
[05:35] Really?
Hmm. Go.
[05:37] Alright. I'm leaving. I'll be back in the evening.
[05:39] Before evening.
[05:41] I'll be back.
[05:43] Bag.. my bag is left. I'll go get it.
[05:52] Shaista? Where is my tea?
I'm bringing it.
[05:56] If you can't make it, I'll go out and have it.
[06:01] Adnan, be patient. I'm coming in 5 minutes.
[06:04] You've been telling me 5 minutes since the past fifteen minutes.
[06:08] It seems like you're making trotters and not tea.
[06:11] You know we have slow gas at this hour.
[06:13] Its taking time because of this or else I'd have made the tea long ago.
[06:16] This country has weird problems. No gas, no electricity. You let it be.
[06:21] I'll have tea outside.
[06:23] Oh, it has boiled. Wait. I'm bringing it.
[06:26] Oh God.. Adnan and his anger. The tea is ready and he left.
[06:45] Mirha? I want to talk to you. Please listen to me once
[06:52] Leave my hand.
[06:56] Why are you here? You're stalking me.
[06:59] Mirha, I want to discuss something very important with you.
[07:02] I don't want to listen to you. If you take one more step ahead, I'll make noise.
[07:10] I don't even want to see your face again.
[07:13] Get lost. Go!
[07:21] Mirha.. Mirha.. Relax. Nothing happened. Come with me.
[07:56] This..
You won't come inside?
[08:02] No.
[08:03] Alright. At least you came here for me, its enough. Thank you.
[08:12] Take care of yourself.
You too.
[08:14] Take care of mom and Zara as well. Bye.
[08:34] Saad?
[08:37] How are you? We're meeting after so many days.
[08:44] Now you're here so come inside. Come.
I'm getting late.
[08:48] How will you be late? You just came. Come. Leave it now.
[08:54] How is Zara?
Don't even take her name from your dirty name.
[08:59] Alright. I won't take her name from my dirty tongue.
[09:03] But I can remember her.
[09:06] Those were the days.
[09:08] Zara lived her and time used to pass by laughing and talking.
[09:12] The tea Zara made..
[09:15] It was amazing. Zara..
Shut up with your nonsense.
[09:21] Whats wrong? Why are you angry?
[09:26] Do you remember this place?
[09:29] This is the same place where you hit me and Zara tried to hit me too.
[09:37] And see what I did.
[09:40] Your engagement broke and Zara's relation with this house.
[09:45] This is what we call, killing two targets with one bullet.
[09:50] I took my revenge.
[09:52] Right?
[09:54] Now I'm upset that I cannot get any entertainment in this house after Zara left.
[10:00] Who should I joke with? Whom should I befriend? There's nobody.
[10:05] Yes. Dolly is here. Your sister. I'll befriend her
[10:10] If you even take her name. I'll break your face.
[10:17] You cannot do that. You cannot do any such thing.
[10:22] You have no courage. If you could do anything,
[10:26] you would have done that day.
[10:28] You don't have the courage.
[10:31] Your dirty facade..
[10:34] it will come to the forefront one day.
[10:40] It will definitely do but it will be very late by then.
[10:45] I have an advice for you.
[10:48] Get lost from here and I don't want to see your face in this house.
[10:54] If I see you again in this house,
[10:57] I'll destroy you.. you won't be able to show your face to anyone.
[11:10] Fly as much as you want to.
[11:14] The day you fall, nobody will come save you.
[11:29] Bye.
[11:40] Nobody will save me.. like nobody saved you..
[11:52] Shaista you?
[12:06] I spent my entire life with this man. I didn't know he was such a cheap man.
[12:13] Whats wrong? What are you doing? Is everything alright?
[12:15] Leave me..
[12:17] Listen to me.
[12:18] I don't even want to live with you for a moment.
[12:21] I couldn't even think you were such a cheap man.
[12:23] At least listen to me.
[12:24] I don't want to listen to you. I heard everything with my ears.
[12:28] You're such a cheap and dirty man.
[12:30] I didn't even think. I don't want to live with you.
[12:33] Where are you going? Where will you go?
[12:35] I can go to hell as far as you care. Move! Don't you dare touch me.
[12:43] This..
[12:50] My jewelry? Where is my jewelry?
[12:55] Where is my jewelry? Tell me, where is it?
[12:59] How would I know where did your jewelry go? You had kept them here.
[13:02] Who else would know?
[13:03] Nobody else other than you knew that I kept my jewelry here. Tell me.
[13:07] Tell me where is my jewelry.
[13:08] Are you mad? How would I know where your jewelry is?
[13:10] Yes I am mad. You're lying. You stole my jewelry.
[13:14] I don't even want to spend a moment with you.
[13:16] Listen to me Shaista. You've lost your mind. One minute.
[13:19] Yes. I have lost my mind. I wasted so many years of my life with you.
[13:24] I couldn't recognize a man like you. What were you?!
[13:28] Are you mad? Why aren't you listening to me? Shaista.
[13:32] Shaista listen to me.
[13:33] I'm telling you.. don't touch me. Don't! You're a dirty, cheap man.
[13:39] I'll tell everyone you did everything.
[13:42] You destroyed Saad and Zara's life.
[13:45] You are the one who destroyed their life.
[13:48] And you only didn't destroy Zara's life. You don't have your eyes on her only..
[13:52] You have eyes on every single girl. And you associated me in this sin as well.
[13:57] I will tell everyone and show them your real face. I'll tell them how dirty and cheap you are.
[14:03] You're such a cheap man.
[14:05] Shaista listen to me.. Listen to me..
[14:09] I will tell everyone.
Listen to me.
[14:12] I don't want to hear you.
Listen to me Shaista. You'll fall down. Shaista?
[14:16] Listen to me.. Why are you making so much noise?
[14:18] I don't want to hear you out.. I..
[14:26] Shaista?
Mom..
[14:31] Shaista?
[14:34] Shaista? Move away. Shaista?
[14:37] What happened?
I don't know. I was in the room.
[14:41] She slipped on the stairs. Ambulance?
call Ali...
[14:44] Shaista?
Dear, call the ambulance. 911.. Call..
[14:50] Call the ambulance.
Shaista? Shaista?
[14:57] Did you inform?
I did..
[14:59] Oh God.. Oh God..
How should we pick her up?
[15:03] Are you alright, Mirha?
[15:05] Yes. I..
[15:09] He left?
Yes he did. And even if he didn't.
[15:15] He cannot come to the library.
[15:17] Relax and tell me what happened?
[15:21] I don't know how he came here Sadaf.
[15:24] Trust me I haven't contacted him after that day.
[15:30] He has been following me since two days.
[15:33] What should I do?
[15:34] Why didn't you tell me earlier Mirha? I'd have done something.
[15:38] I didn't understand what to do myself.
[15:41] He came in front of me all of a sudden. What could I do?
[15:46] I was scared.
Leave it and relax.
[15:51] What would he want now?
[15:54] He has taken everything from me.
[15:57] My family's peace, our money. He has taken everything.
[16:04] What more does he want?
[16:05] What did he tell you? Did he say something?
[16:09] I didn't understand what he was saying. I don't want to hear anything, Sadaf.
[16:16] I don't want to talk to him.
[16:18] Mirha, my dear, relax. We'll do something.
[16:22] Please come home with me..
We'll leave when we get off.
[16:26] Mirha, get up and leave. And now relax.
[16:40] Uncle.. how is aunt now?
[16:44] I don't know. I couldn't see Shaista's condition.
[16:48] I don't understand how to handle this situation.
[16:52] Its good you and Manzoor came. I couldn't understand anything.
[16:58] Uncle, don't worry. Nothing will happen to aunt, if God wills.
If God wills.
[17:05] Yes doctor? How is Shaista now?
[17:08] I'm sorry Mr. Adnan. We couldn't save your wife.
[17:12] Actually, she had expired before you brought her to the hospital.
[17:15] But how could..
[17:16] Actually, the fall from the stairs gave her such a deep injury that she died on the spot.
[17:22] Please get him to compose himself. Fill in the paperwork and you can take her body.
[17:28] I'm very sorry. But may God do the best for her.
Uncle..
[17:35] What..
Body?
[17:46] Dial your father's number and ask how's Shaista?
[17:52] Yes mom.. Water..
[17:58] What happened?
Dad isn't answering.
[18:01] I don't understand how did she fall down from the stairs.
[18:04] She came down ten times in a day, never until today..
[18:09] she slipped. And now she fell face forward.
[18:15] Before we went to the hospital, she had lost a bucket of blood.
[18:19] Yes mom, even I don't understand. How did she fall?
[18:23] Mom.. don't worry. Dad and Ali have gone. Shaista aunty will be alright.
[18:31] My head isn't working. I don't understand. I should have gone along. 
[18:37] I shouldn't have listened to Ali.
[18:40] You call Ali and tell him to come and take me along or else I'll take a rikshah and go.
[18:43] I'll try Ali.
[18:51] Brother Ali.. where are you? Mom is worried? Mom wants to come to the hospital? Hows aunty?
[18:59] What?
[19:02] What happened?
[19:05] What did he say?
[19:06] Mom..
[19:08]  Aunt..
[19:10] Aunt passed away..
[19:12] What? What are you saying Zaini?
[19:19] Shaista is dead?
[19:26] She's dead? Oh my God..
Mom..
[19:31] Oh God..
Mom please compose yourself.
[19:34] please mom
[19:36] Mom.. you'll get sick. Mom..
[19:42] Mom.. no..
[19:47] Mom, please compose yourself. You'll get sick. Mom..
[19:54] Oh my God.. How can it be possible? 
[19:59] Mom..
she was fine until morning
[21:21] Come..
[21:28] How do you like my house?
[21:30] Its beautiful. 
[21:33] But why isn't anybody here?
[21:36] I mean, your mother. Where is aunty?
[21:41] She has gone out for some work.
[21:52] You said she was waiting for me.
[21:55] She was waiting but we got late so she left.
[22:02] So lets do one thing, we'll go as well. I'll meet her some other day.
[22:05] Wait. Come inside and sit. You just came.
[22:14] Actually I'm feeling anxious. 
[22:18] Lets go to a restaurant. We'll sit there.
[22:23] Why are you being anxious? 
[22:25] Come. Lets sit. Come.
[22:31] Come..
[22:58] Come..
[23:02] Come sit here with me.
[23:07] How are you talking to me?
[23:12] What happened? I'm asking you to sit with me. Whats the problem?
[23:18] You weren't worried when you came here. Why are you acting now?
[23:24] Fahad?
[23:27] Stop acting like a respectable woman in front of me.
[23:31] I'm not acting.
[23:45] I think you'll not understand like this. 
[23:49] Sameer? Iftekhar?
[23:56] Leave me..
Where are you going?
[24:01] Fahad.. Who are they?
[24:03] You really wanted to meet my family.
[24:08] This is my family.
[24:09] Why are you doing this to me?
[24:12]  Why did you bring me here? Spare me for God's sake. Let me leave.
[24:17] As soon as Sadaf called, I was so anxious. I came running.
[24:23] You're amazing.
[24:24] Girls take stress about their education in this age and that's why her blood pressured lowered. 
[24:29] She had juice. Look how fresh she looks.
All praise to the Lord.
[24:34] Sadaf, you could have brought her home directly.
[24:37] Aunty we were coming home. But mom called 
[24:40] and she said you were coming over so I brought her along.
[24:44] You did good. I was thinking to come since so many days so I thought I'd come today.
[24:51] Thank God you found an excuse as well. Tell me hows Mahi. You could have brought her along.
[24:56] Mahi had gone to her friend's house.
[24:59] This means everyone went to see their friends today.
[25:03] Mom, the two of you keep talking. Mirha and I are going to the kitchen to make tea. 
[25:07] You want something else?
[25:09] Yes dear, there are kebabs in the freezer. Fry them and bring them along.
[25:13] Okay mom. Come Mirha.
[25:16] And tell me whats going on?
[25:18] Nothing much. I keep doing the house chores the entire day. Sadaf goes to university 
[25:22] and then I get bored. And you tell me, whats up.
[25:29] Oh God.. dear, how did it happen? 
[25:33] You just dropped Dolly a few hours ago.
[25:37] I don't know mom.
[25:40] We'll find out when we talk to Dolly in detail. 
[25:43] What I don't understand how did Shaista aunty fall down?
[25:48] Dear, who can put off fate? She had this much life. 
[25:53] But I think we should go there.
[25:57] Mom, how will we go there? Everybody will be there and they'll say a lot of things. 
[26:02] Do one thing, you should call.
[26:04] No, dear. There has been a death there.
[26:07] Not because of a relationship but even for humanity, we'll have to go there. 
[26:11] Your sister is there. She'll have to hear taunts. 
[26:16] Its best if we face people bravely.
[26:20] Aunty, dad told me not to come to that house. 
[26:26] He'll get angry if he sees me in these circumstances.
[26:29] Its alright dear. Parents anger is like soap bubbles. 
[26:35] It settles down eventually.
[26:40] And then, both of you have this chance to mend broken relationships.
[26:48] Zara, mom is right.
[27:39] What happened to Shaista?
[27:43] Nothing.
[27:46]  She fell down the stairs.
[27:50] But she fell down with a lot of blood everywhere.
[27:55]  They took her to the hospital.
[28:00] But she didn't make it.
[28:02] Be strong. She was always like your sister. Never your tenant or relative.
[28:09] Yes, we are all helpless against God's will.
[28:15] She cared for me, more than a sister. 
[28:19] She never let me feel I didn't have a sister.
[28:23]  It wasn't time for her to leave.
[28:29] Its a very sad news. She was too young to die. 
[28:32] Poor Adnan. He's all alone now.
[28:36] You're right. Really.
[28:40] See, Zara is here.
[28:46] Mom.. Mom, Zara is here.
[31:12] Rikshah?
[31:25] Mahi? You?
[31:36] Mahi? What is this? 
[31:38] How are you here?
[31:42] Come along. I'll drop you home. Sit please.
[32:24] You didn't only destroy Zara's life, you didn't have your eyes on her only.
[32:28]  You have eyes on every girl in this house.
[32:31] You involved me in this crime as well. 
[32:33] I'll tell everyone and show everyone your real face. 
[32:36] I'll tell everyone how cheap and dirty you are.
[32:39] You're such a bad man.. leave me..
Shaita listen to me..
[33:08] Are you okay? 
[33:11] Don't worry. You're safe now.
[33:19] Anybody can doubt you in such a situation. 
[33:22] Your family will get worried if they see you like this.
[33:28] Does this make a difference?
[33:30] Don't be stubborn and listen to me. Relax.
[33:37] Please drop me home. I have to go home.
[33:42] Okay.
[34:48] Why was she so scared? Should I ask her? 
[34:53] No. I have no relation with her.
[34:56] What she did with me.. 
[34:59] But why am I thinking about her? 
I shouldn't think about her.
[35:25] Fahad.. the girl you wooed is very beautiful.
[35:31] I'm warning you. Stay away from me.
[35:36] Take care. I'm coming.
[35:37] What will you do? There's nobody who'll listen to you here.
[35:41] Stay away from me. Stay away...
Stop her..
[35:56] Go.. get the car.
[37:01] Whats wrong? Why has Mahi in the dark?
[37:07] I don't know mom..
[37:11] Should I go and ask her?
[37:13] No. Go and heat dinner, your father will be home soon. I'll go and see. Mahi?
[37:26] Mahi? Mahi?
[37:33] Mahi?
[37:37] Its you..
[37:39] What happened to you? When did you come?
[37:42]  Why are all the lights switched off? Is everything okay? You feeling well?
[37:50] I'm fine.
[37:53] You don't seem fine.
[37:55] Mom, I have a headache.
I'll get you medicine.
[37:59] No. I'll take it in a bit, mom.
Listen..
[38:03] Bushra was missing you. She complained why I didn't bring you along. 
[38:09] You'll have to go with me the next time.
[38:12] Mom, I have a headache. 
[38:15] I want to sleep.
[38:17] Alright. Sleep. Call me if you need anything.
