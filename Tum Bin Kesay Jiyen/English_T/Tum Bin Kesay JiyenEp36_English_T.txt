[00:13] My God, what did you do Mahi?
[00:18] What will I say to Ahmed now?
[00:38] Fareeda?
[00:41] How's Zara and how did this happen?
[00:44] How do I know? I went inside the kitchen and saw Zara on the floor.
[00:51] I've told you a thousand time not to let Zara go inside the kitchen.
[00:56] Where was Mahi at the time?
[00:59] Mahi... she had a fever since morning. She didn't even leave her room.
[01:08] Ahmed...
[01:12] Will Zara get better?
[01:17] Nothing will happen to Adeel, right?
[01:22] Just pray for her Fareeda.
[01:26] Let me tell you one thing. If anything bad happens to Zara...
[01:32] then I will not forgive anyone.
[01:55] What did I do? What have I done to Zara?
[02:01] I didn't want this.
[02:05] No, nothing will happen to her.
[02:10] I didn't shove her.
[02:13] I was just trying to get her out of the way and she fell.
[02:19] Yes, why am I being afraid?
[02:24] I didn't do anything.
[02:27] I shouldn't be afraid.
[02:29] Nothing will happen, she's fine. The baby will be fine too.
[02:35] Sister...
Yes?
[02:37] Father called.
How's Zara?
[02:41] She had a miscarriage.
What?
[03:12] How are you feeling now?
[03:18] My dear don't cry.
[03:22] Maybe this is what God wanted.
[03:28] Zara, control yourself. You need to be strong right now.
[03:40] She's right. Control yourself.
[03:47] Doctor, how long will it take for her to get discharged.
[03:51] We are keeping her under observation.
[03:54] We'll send her home as soon as she starts feeling better.
[03:58] Alright. Thank you.
[04:06] May God give your strength.
[04:27] Thank God that you're here.
[04:30] I was worried when your father told me that they weren't let you coming.
[04:35] Yes mother. They didn't want me to leave the job.
[04:38] But I gave my final decision to leave. Then they accepted my resignation.
[04:46] Strange.
[04:47] Brother, did you see the sherwani. Tell me how you like it.
[04:52] Mother, you said that it was nice, but this isn't.
[04:56] If you didn't like it, then we can have it changed.
[05:01] What I mean to say that it's very nice!
You almost scared me!
[05:07] Thank God!
I was scared as well.
[05:12] If you guys are done, shall I talk about something important.
[05:15] Sure, go ahead.
[05:16] My dear, I don't Saad to be burdened, that's why I want to give some responsibility to Usama as well.
[05:25] I don't think I need to ask you to help him.
[05:29] Alright father, I'll take a look.
[05:32] Saad shouldn't feel that he's alone.
[05:35] I asked Zaini to take her clothes to Dolly's place and get ready there.
[05:44] Shaista, Maheen and I will take care of things.
As you say mother.
[05:49] No one will be burdened if we work together.
[05:53] You did finalize the food right?
[05:57] Yes I did. I had Saad talk to the catering people as well.
[06:03] Good.
[06:06] There is so much to do. One job ends and another one begins.
[06:10] One ends and there's something else to do.
[06:15] Brother Ahmed is calling as well.
[06:20] Greetings brother Ahmed.
[06:24] Before you arrived we...
What?
[06:43] You are jealous of my happiness.
[06:46] You don't want me to be happy.
[06:50] Your sister and you planned against me.
[06:54] Why did you do this to me?
Mahi, it's not like this... listen to me...
[07:00] Don't you dare touch me... I hate you. I'm disgusted by you.
[07:06] I hate your existence! Get out of my sight!
Auntie!
[07:44] Sarwat please...
[07:47] Why did this happen?
[07:51] Why did this happen?
Control yourself.
[07:54] Who has victimizing our happiness?
[07:57] It's gone the moment it arrives.
[08:00] I don't know what God wants.
[08:04] I told you to bring her here. I asked you to not let them keep her.
[08:12] I told you that they won't be able to take care of her.
[08:15] But you didn't listen to me... look what they did to my daughter.
[08:22] She stole my daughter's child from her.
Mother control yourself, you'll get sick.
[08:27] How can I control myself?
[08:33] Take me there... I want to see my daughter.
[08:38] Take me to my daughter... what was my daughter's fault?
[08:44] God gave my daughter one happiness and they stole it from her.
[08:49] Yes we'll go... my son prepare, we'll leave today.
[08:55] Sure father...
Go and get your mother ready.
[09:02] Control yourself.
I talked to her a few days ago and she was fine.
[09:14] Adeel is dead. You killed my Adeel!
[09:19] Why did you do this? Why did you do this?
[09:23] I swear to God I didn't do it on purpose.
[09:27] I shoved her and she fell. I didn't do anything.
[09:32] What face will I show to my son? How will I face Zara?
[09:39] My son's last memory is gone because of you.
[09:46] You killed my son's memory.
[09:48] I made a mistake, please forgive me mother.
[09:51] Mistake? Is you mistake worthy of forgiveness?
[09:56] No it is not!
[10:00] Still to save you I lied in front of your father.
[10:06] Do you know what will happen...
[10:10] if he learns the truth?
No mother...
[10:15] You let your hatred consume you.
[10:19] You didn't Zara to have a baby and stay in this house.
[10:27] You did this on purpose, right? You did this on purpose.
[10:32] No... Mahi... Zara didn't deserve this and you took revenge from her.
[10:39] I made a grave mistake, forgive me.
[10:41] What revenge did you take from her? You also took revenge from your mother.
[10:47] You have killed me Mahi... you killed me!
[10:55] How will show my face?
Forgive me mother...
[11:00] What will I answer my son? How will I face Zara?
[11:07] You did not think of this once. How can you be so cruel?
[11:14] How can you be so cruel? I will never forgive you!
[11:44] Saad...
Yes mother?
[11:47] Are you doing something important.
[11:50] It's not that important. What is it?
[11:54] Yes... I kept this money aside for Dolly.
[11:59] You can keep it for you work.
[12:02] Mother I have money, I'll manage.
[12:06] I know son... still keep it.
[12:09] Mother, give this money to Dolly.
[12:14] I don't need it. Besides, I've arranged for the money.
[12:19] From where? I talked in my office to get an advanced salary.
[12:25] The boss has approved it today
[12:27] You don't need to worry about anything.
[12:31] Everything will be taken care.
[12:32] May God bless every mother with a son like you.
[12:36] Mother....
Mother!
[12:38] What happened?
[12:40] Ali called... they are saying that Zara had a miscarriage.
What?
[12:44] May God have mercy. How did this happen?
[13:00] Let's go.
[13:07] Let's go.
Uncle I should come along with you guys.
[13:10] No son stay here. Zaini is here and Maheen will be here too.
[13:13] You'll have to take care of everyone here.
[13:15] Uncle, Zara will be in pain right now.
[13:18] I understand that you are concerned for your friend.
[13:21] We will bring her back.
[13:23] Saad he's right. Ali is coming with us. You should stay.
[13:30] Alright? Take care. Farewell.
Be safe on your travel sister.
[13:36] Give Zara my love.
[13:58] Mother.
[14:00] Mother.
[14:03] What happened? Is everything alright? How come you're back early from work?
[14:07] I came early because I needed to drop Maheen at her mother's place.
[14:11] What was so urgent that she called you back so early?
[14:15] Umm... shall we go?
[14:18] Will someone tell me what happened?
Zara had a miscarriage.
[14:24] How?
[14:25] I don't know. I wasn't able to talk much with mother. She was leaving for Hyderabad.
[14:30] You should have told me this Maheen.
[14:33] I was on my way to tell you.
[14:38] Are you guys going to Hyderabad?
Zaini is at home alone right now...
[14:43] Mother has asked us to stay there.
[14:46] Hamza will you stay there as well?
[14:48] No mother, I'll return after I drop her off?
[14:52] Alright fine. Be careful... let's go.
[15:07] Zara.
[15:10] Say something my dear.
[15:14] I've been sitting here with you for a while.
[15:18] I'm trying to talk to you but you aren't answering.
[15:24] I know your pain is big.
[15:29] I know that you are shocked. It's not easy to lose one's child.
[15:39] I...
[15:42] I have gone through this pain that's why I understand how you feel.
[15:51] But...
[15:56] Say something Zara.
[16:01] I'm saying this because I've lost my son.
[16:09] I don't want to lose Mahi.
[16:14] You know your uncle.
[16:18] If he learn the truth...
[16:22] then he would never have forgiven Mahi.
[16:27] You understand what I'm saying, right?
[16:35] I know this is unjust... still I'm asking you...
[16:45] to forgive Mahi.
[16:52] I know it's very hard for you.
[16:57] She has caused you a great deal of pain.
[17:02] It's good to forgive.
[17:07] And you are among those who forgive. You've forgiven me as well.
[17:13] I was so unjust to you.
[17:18] You forgave me, right?
[17:28] Zara...
[17:32] For your uncle... for this life... forgive her.
[17:40] If he learns the truth he won't be able to tolerate it... I know...
[17:47] She won't be able to.
[17:55] First...
[17:58] He already has the pain of losing his son.
[18:05] He's still shocked about Mahi marriage breaking.
[18:11] And then... this happened to you.
[18:17] I don't want...
[18:23] He won't be able to withstand it.
[18:29] Zara... do you understand what I'm saying, right?
[18:41] Look at this... I beg you.
[18:49] Don't tell your uncle and your family anything.
[18:56] For God's sake don't tell them.
[19:01] All of them...
[19:04] Your uncle won't be able to withstand it.
[19:10] Mahi was cruel with you.
[19:15] I too was cruel with you.
[19:18] Forgive Mahi.
[19:24] Forgive her for Adeel.
[19:28] You forgave me as well... if your uncle finds out he'll die.
[19:39] Forgive her!
[19:42] Forgive her!
[20:04] Do you think that if you hang out with a girl...
[20:09] then no one will find out.
[20:11] What nonsense is this? What girl?
[20:14] What kind of nonsense are you saying?
Nonsense...
[20:19] You know that I'm not speaking nonsense.
[20:33] I have a headache. I need a cup of tea.
[20:37] Why are you upstairs? Zaini must be alone downstairs.
[20:40] No... Maheen is here...
[20:43] Saad will be returning after dropping sister Asifa.
[20:47] Oh, so he's here as well.
[20:50] What happened to Zara was a tragedy. It shouldn't have happened.
[20:53] I don't understand you.
[20:57] When you heard the good news you stated that it shouldn't have happened.
[21:02] Now that tragedy has struck her, you're saying that this shouldn't have happened to her.
[21:07] What do you want?
[21:08] It's just something I said... how could I have known that this would happen?
[21:16] What happened to that girl is terrible and it shouldn't have happened.
[21:20] I'm sad as well, but one begs to wonder how this happened.
[21:26] I suspect Zara's sister-in-law, she's the one who did this.
[21:30] What are you saying? It makes no sense.
[21:35] I've seen the world... I can tell what someone's thinking just by taking a look at them.
[21:39] I've been noticing Mahi for a long time now.
[21:42] Do you remember how many hurdles she created during Zara's marriage?
[21:46] What about what she did with Maheen? Have you forgotten?
[21:48] Adnan, all of that is in the past.
[21:51] She couldn't have done something like that now.
[21:54] Because that child was her brother's last memory.
[21:57] No everything is how it seems.
[22:00] And I'm sure that what I'm thinking is right.
[22:05] Anyways...
[22:08] Brother Manzoor and sister have gone there. We'll learn the truth soon enough.
[22:15] I'll get going.
Where are you going?
[22:18] I'm going for a walk. What else will I do after eating?
[22:33] Let me eat this... he has a habit of leaving food behind.
[23:07] Hey! Didn't you go? I thought you would go running there.
[23:15] I don't want to talk to you right now.
[23:17] What's the matter? I was just checking up on you and you're being rude.
[23:22] I don't want you checking up on me!
[23:24] Why are you always so angry at me? What did I ever do to you?
[23:30] Are you leaving, or should I?
I'll leave..
[23:36] My path is clear ahead, but I'm worried about you.
[23:41] You're path is full of hurdles and I was thinking of clearing it up.
[23:46] I don't understand
[23:48] You will very soon.
[23:52] Stay in  your limits.
[23:54] Again with your anger. Why are you always so angry?
[23:58] Restrict your vile thinking to yourself. I know how vile you are.
[24:03] What are you saying? What did I do?
[24:06] What you've done? Do you think..
[24:10] that if you would hangout with a girl...
[24:14] that no one will find out.
What nonsense is this? What girl?
[24:19] You are speaking nonsense.
Nonsense?
[24:24] You know that I'm not speaking nonsense.
[24:30] I'm warning you one last time,
[24:33] if you ever say something in front of me again, I won't take a second exposing you.
[24:39] This is your last warning.
[24:42] Correct yourself.
[24:54] I'll be the one to correct you.
[25:09] Zara.
[25:29] I'm here.
[25:31] Everything will be alright my dear.
[25:45] Enough my dear...
[25:51] Enough...
[26:00] How did this happen?
[26:02] I handed my daughter to you guys. How did this happen?
[26:13] I understand your pain Sarwat
[26:18] Believe me, I feel the same pain of losing Adeel's last memory.
[26:23] No sister Fareeda.
[26:27] No one among us can even begin to feel my daughter's pain.
[26:32] A tragedy has befallen Zara.
[26:36] What more will she have to face at her age?
[26:39] How will she deal with this sadness?
[26:46] Sarwat... control yourself.
[26:49] Sarwat... I have wronged you.
[26:55] I was the one who promised you that I will take care of Zara.
[27:04] I couldn't fulfill my promise again.
[27:09] Forgive me.
[27:11] I beg in front of you two.
[27:22] I want to take Zara with me.
[27:27] Alright Sarwat.
[27:30] Take her with you.
[27:34] She's your daughter and you're her mother.
[27:38] You will be take better care of her.
[27:41] Take her... I won't stop you.
[28:19] I'm warning you one last time.
[28:22] If you dare say anything in front of me, I won't lost a second exposing you.
[28:33] You'll find messing with me very costly Saad.
[28:40] You don't what I can do. You've placed your hand in snake's den.
[28:48] It's hard for you to get away now.
[29:00] Zara, come with us.
[29:04] Don't ask me to leave you here.
[29:16] Auntie, father is calling you.
Sure.
[29:21] Sure... I'll see what he's saying.
[29:40] Zara...
[29:46] I know that you are angry at me.
[29:49] But I swear I didn't do it on purpose. I was just angry.
[29:54] Go away from here.
[29:58] Listen to me...
I said leave!
[30:06] Zara....
Mother...
[30:10] Mother! Auntie!
[30:14] Get up... mother!
What happened! My God...
[30:21] I was speaking and she started feeling pain.
Pain?
[30:29] Auntie, call a doctor, quickly!
Sure.
[30:33] I'll call one right away. Don't worry Zara, I'll call a doctor.
[30:38] She's calling a doctor. What happened my dear?
[30:45] Hurry up!
[30:48] Ask Ali to bring the doctor here.
It hurts!
[30:58] Doctor what happened to her?
[31:02] There's nothing to worry about. I've given her some painkillers.
[31:06] In a while she'll feel better.
[31:09] Why did she start feeling pain again?
[31:14] This happens under her condition.
[31:17]  Let her be on complete bed rest and keep her away from stress.
[31:21] Doctor, we want to take her to Karachi.
[31:26] Sorry, I can't allow that under condition.
[31:29]  She's in no condition to travel.
[31:33] I'll write some medicines, give them to her on time.
[31:50] I'll escort you outside doctor.
[31:55] Okay...
Thank you doctor.
[32:12] Mother shouldn't have gone there alone. She should have taken me there.
[32:20] What would you have done there?
[32:23] I would have asked them why they did this to Zara.
[32:27] Whatever happened to Zara had nothing to do with them.
[32:31] Instead of talking about this, pray for Zara.
[32:36] Why does things always come back to me?
No they don't.
[32:42] Rather, you always say things that don't matter.
[32:46] You are speaking unnecessarily.
[32:50] You two fighting won't solve Zara's problems.
[32:54] Saad, is Zara coming back or not?
[32:58] Zara isn't coming.
[33:00] What?
What? Why isn't she coming?
[33:05] Even after what happened she wants to stay there.
[33:08] Zara isn't well, the doctor has asked her not to travel.
[33:12] Then we should extend the marriage as well.
[33:17] You can talk to uncle once he comes back.
[33:21] What happened to him?
[33:27] What do you mean? You're talking about postponing his sister's wedding.
[33:31] His bound to be upset.
[33:33] A tragedy is befallen my sister and he's worried about his sister's wedding.
[33:37] Please don't assume. Let mother and father come back, they'll make the right decision.
[33:44] Please... don't involve Saad in your matters.
[33:59] There is no need to react so much Maheen.
[34:09] Mother... here's the medicine.
[34:13] Are you okay?
[34:24] Why are you so silent?
[34:27] Why don't you tell me what's in your heart.
[34:35] Nothing seems nice.
[34:44] It feels as though my life has been turned upside down.
[34:52] I thought that after Adeel...
[34:56] I would not live my life alone.
[35:03] This child would become like Adeel.
[35:07] He would be with me.
[35:10] He's gone now
[35:14] How will I live without him now?
[35:46] May God give you patience.
[35:56] All of us are with you.
[36:08] What happened my dear... how did you fall?
[36:17] I was paying attention.
[36:20] I hit something and fell.
[36:24] I didn't realize that I would lose so much.
[36:37] May God create ease for you.
[36:44] Zara, it's only a few more days...
[36:49] then we'll take you away from here.
[36:53] And if you want, we can take you away from here.
[37:04] Then maybe...
[37:07] I won't get the chance again.
[37:11] I want to spend my sadness with Adeel's memory.
[37:22] Give me a few days.
[37:25] Then I'll do as you say. I'll listen to everything you say...
