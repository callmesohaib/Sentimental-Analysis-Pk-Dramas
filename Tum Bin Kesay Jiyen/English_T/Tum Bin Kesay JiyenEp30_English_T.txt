[00:15] What do you want to do about this?
[00:18] Do you want me to humiliate Aqib by introducing him to them?
[00:22] You know how Mahi is... she's say whatever comes to mind to him.
[00:27] She's already labeled him as a thief.
[00:30] What will she do when she meets him?
[00:31] I was thinking what would have happened if she hadn't gone with Usama.
[00:37] Maybe it would have been the last time she met Usama.
[00:40] what are you saying?
[00:41] Would we have made our daughter stay at home for the rest of her life?
[00:46] What else?
[00:48] Why are you getting worried? I will not tell anyone anything, you know how I am.
[00:59] My dear, your uncle Adnan is with you. Why are you getting worried?
[01:05] I'm here.
[01:19] What trouble do I find myself in?
[01:25] If she asks someone then I won't be able to stay in this house for a second.
[01:34] And Saad... he will kill me.
[02:59] Of course.
[03:02] Come here my dear child. You are the peace of our eyes.
[03:07] Come Zaviar... look at the surprise we've brought you.
[03:12] What is all this?
These are sweetmeats.
[03:17] Since your marriage has been finalized...
[03:22] you aunt has decided to distribute sweetmeats in the neighborhood and your in-laws.
[03:28] We'll start with you in-laws first.
[03:32] Yes...
[03:35] What is the matter Zaviyar? Are you not happy?
[03:40] Zaviar, what's the matter?
[03:44] Uncle we have a problem.
What problem?
[03:50] I cannot marry right now.
[03:51] My son, you're the one who agreed to this.
[03:56] Why are you refusing now? Did brother Ahmed say something?
[04:01] No, it's not like that.
[04:03] I like Mahi and I've convinced auntie as well.
[04:09] Then what's the problem?
[04:12] Uncle, I want to shift my business to Lahore.
[04:16] It's getting hard for me to manage things in Lahore and Hyderabad.
[04:19] You know how things are at the factory.
[04:22] It's important for me to be there. Until the business is settled in Lahore properly...
[04:28] Mr. Tahir will be able to handle it but no one is working there properly.
[04:33] It was hard for me to settle this business and I don't want to lose it at any cost.
[04:38] If you could ask Mr. Ahmed to marry me to Mahi,
[04:44] I could take her with me to Lahore.
[04:47] Hmm... I understand what your problem is.
[04:52] But, they will not agree on such short notice.
[04:58] Then you should talk to them. They are your old friends. Try convincing them.
[05:06] Friends should come to your aid in times of need. Ask them to come to a compromise.
[05:13] Look, it's not that easy. After their son's death...
[05:17] it would be hard for them to forget and marry their daughter.
[05:21] You are right Mr. Alam, I'm not asking for a huge commotion.
[05:27] I can realize what they feel.
[05:30] Alright, if you say so...
[05:33] I'll try...
[05:35] I want a simple marriage uncle.
[05:39] But at least talk to them.
[05:43] Alright my son. I'll try.
[05:47] But if they choose to refuse.
[05:51] Then what?
[05:52] Try talking to them, if they do not agree, we'll think of something else.
[05:57] As you wish.
[06:00] Improve your mood. Don't worry, everything will be alright.
[06:07] Why have you decided to leave? Is it something that we did?
[06:13] No brother, it's not like that...
[06:17] Actually it's my daughter's in-laws and we stayed here for quite a few days. We would like to leave now.
[06:23] Sister Asfa, when I talked to you yesterday you said that you would leave once Ali leaves.
[06:29] Then why all of a sudden?
[06:32] That's what I planned...
[06:35] But I got sick... I didn't tell you because I didn't want to worry you.
[06:43] Sister you should have told me, I would have asked Ali to take you to the hospital.
[06:46] No brother it isn't like that. Thank God I'm fine now.
[06:52] Please allow us to leave now.
[06:57] It would have been great for a few more days.
[07:00] Maheen has returned home as well.
[07:03] He'll leave for work. Only Zaini and I will be left and I feel very anxious.
[07:12] Please don't worry.
[07:17] You can call Dolly whenever you want. She's your daughter.
[07:23] Alright, whatever you think is best. How will you guys go?
[07:29] Is Saad coming?
Brother is out running errands.
[07:34] I'll call a cab.
[07:36] No need for that. Ali will drop you guys. Ali take them please.
[07:42] Sure father.
My dear, bring my bag and my medicine.
[07:49] Sure mother.
[07:54] I will call you when I'm worried. Please send Dolly.
[07:59] Why are you worrying?
[08:02] I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you. You have helped us in our times of need.
[08:11] Be strong. This is God's will.
[09:15] Zara... here you are my dear. Have breakfast.
[09:22] I'm not hungry auntie.
[09:24] Zara... how are you not hungry? You have to eat.
[09:33] When my grandchild comes into this world, I'll take good care of him.
[09:40] I will love him. I will never let him be away from me.
[09:47] What if it's a daughter?
What are you saying?
[09:52] Don't say such things. Prayers can get accepted at any moment now.
[09:58] Be careful...
[10:00] a women has a lot of things to worry about under your condition. So avoid saying such things.
[10:07] The most beautiful feeling for a women is to become a mother.
[10:13] It makes no difference to her if it's a boy or a girl.
[10:18] A mother's love doesn't distinguish.
[10:21] No need to think of such things.
[10:27] Just think that, God willing, you'll have a son.
[10:32] And I'm sure you'll have a son and I'll name him Adeel.
[10:37] Don't say such things again. Now have breakfast.
[11:05] Listen to me Dolly.
Did you have something for me?
[11:09] Yes...
It's nothing... carry on.
[11:14] Uncle Adnan, if there's something, I can do it.
[11:16] No there isn't. Besides, I think Ali was calling you.
[11:22] Alright, farewell.
Go.
[11:27] What's the matter? What were you going to say to her?
[11:30] What happened to you all of a sudden?
[11:33] You have never been afraid of your wife.
[11:37] Nor do you care about any relationship.
[11:40] What are you saying?
[11:44] How should I make you understand? It's nothing like that.
[11:46] She calls me uncle, but you don't understand.
[11:53] Alright.
[11:55] I'll believe you.
Thank God.
[11:58] I'll trust you blindly one more time.
[12:02] But you'll have to listen to me as well.
What?
[12:08] You'll have to come with me.
[12:11] Where?
[12:22] Your ice cream is melting. No worries, you can eat mine.
[12:26] It's been a while since we've met.
[12:29] What can we do, this cruel society has build a wall between us.
[12:33] Then break down this wall.
Really... I'll break it down at your will.
[12:38] Don't say such dramatic things.
[12:41] It's called being romantic, not dramatic.
[12:45] You think this is a joke. Do you know how hard it was for me to meet you?
[12:48] Why? Who was stopping you?
Who else than Mahi?
[12:54] She's made my home into check post.
[12:56] She keeps an eye on everyone that comes and goes.
[12:59] How did she let you come today?
[13:01] I took permission from father, telling him that I had an extra class.
[13:04] I thought your sister wanted to meet me, so what's the problem?
[13:09] She doesn't want to meet you. She's asked sister Zara to meet you now.
[13:13] So what? I'll meet her as well. Ihave no problem meeting your sister-in-law.
[13:17] When are we meeting then?
Let sister decided first, only then you can meet her.
[13:22] Do you think she'll agree to meeting me?
[13:24] Even if she doesn't, Mahi knows how to convince people.
[13:27] Alright fine, do as Mahi says.
[13:31] Why are you getting worried? It's good that your sister-in-law wants to meet me.
[13:36] She'll relax once she discusses things with me.
[13:39] This way it will be easy between you and me.
[13:42] Try and understand...
Aqib, do you really want to marry me?
[13:47] Do you still doubt it?
I truly love you Mirha.
[13:52] I can give my life for you.
[13:54] Don't say such things, I want to spend my entire life with you.
[13:58] Then you have to trust me blindly, because there are no questions in love.
[14:04] There is only love. Now eat your ice cream, it's melting.
[14:11] You have to eat this one as well.
[14:13] One is enough. Beside this one has melted.
[14:21] That is what Mahi said?
Yes Saad. Mahi wants me to meet that guy.
[14:27] She wants me to tell him to send his parents if he likes Mirha.
[14:32] Why doesn't she meet him herself?
[14:34] It's her sister's issue she should resolve it herself.
[14:37] Mirha is afraid of Mahi
[14:40] That's why she didn't tell anyone at home. Only me.
[14:44] I don't understand how come Mahi is silent up till now.
[14:47] I don't know what do as well.
[14:50] She's depending on me to take a stand for Mirha.
[14:54] This is not simple. I think you should talk to uncle Ahmed.
[14:58] Saad I told Mahi... but she wants me to meet that man first.
[15:03] Has she gone insane?
[15:05] You are in your waiting period, how can you meet a strange man?
[15:09] Your mother-in-law didn't even let you meet me.
[15:12] Do you remember the scene she created?
[15:15] Forget everything Saad... I've forgotten everything as well.
[15:20] Life has put me through so many tests that I don't fear anything now.
[15:26] Since when did you start talking like this?
[15:29] I've always seen you battling your situation.
[15:33] Since when have you started taking orders?
[15:39] Hello... Zara... hello?
[15:44] Hello... hello... Saad.
[15:55] Who were you talking to?
[15:59] I was talking to Saad.
Why did you hang up then?
[16:03] I didn't hangup, the line disconnected.
[16:06] Tell me something, doesn't Saad work?
[16:09] I mean he's on the phone with you all the time.
[16:12] Saad wanted to talk to me about something.
[16:14] Do you guys talk about everything?
[16:19] Did you have something for me?
[16:23] I wanted to talk to you.
What is it?
[16:27] Mirha has gone to meet that boy again today.
[16:30] Did Mirha tell you?
Why would she?
[16:34] She's not  my friend, she's your friend. I'm sure she told you.
[16:38] No Mirha didn't say anything like that to me.
[16:42] Didn't she tell you?
[16:43] No she didn't, otherwise I would have stopped her from going.
[16:47] I'll talk to Mirha...
Listen to me, where are you going?
[16:53] I asked you to meet that guy, but you didn't listen to me.
[16:57] Now she's meeting that guy in secret.
[16:59] I don't want to meet that guy.
Why not?
[17:03] Why are you forcing me?
[17:05] What is your problem? Why don't you want to meet that guy?
[17:08] I don't want to meet him. If you try to force me again, I'll tell uncle everything.
[17:43] I know everything.
[17:47] The way she refused, I'm sure Saad asked her to say this.
[17:55] Otherwise she would never have refused me.
[18:02] What you didn't wasn't right Zara.
[18:06] I was the one who started this game.
[18:11] And I'll be one to end this game.
[18:18] Not you.
[18:21] I would not let you escape this game so easily.
[18:28] Mother...
Come here my dear. I'm in your room.
[18:37] Greetings*
You look very happy.
[18:43] What are you hiding at the back?
[18:45] Your prayers have worked. I'm about to be very successful.
[18:50] Why are you speaking in riddles? Tell me, what is it?
The thing is...
[18:56] that I've been hired.
Really... thank God!
[19:04] Look, I've brought sweetmeats for you.
[19:06] Let me feed it to you first.
[19:10] Here you are.
[19:13] You have one as well.
[19:16] May God bless my son with success.
Mother, are you crying?
[19:23] My dear, these are tears of joy. I'm happy at my son's success.
[19:30] Mother, I promise that I will work very hard.
[19:35] I will never let tears come to your heart.
[19:38] I know my son is very hardworking.
What is going on here?
[19:45] Eat some sweetmeats. Your brother has found himself a job.
[19:50] Really... here you are.
[19:52] Have something sweet.
[19:53] When was the interview, you didn't tell me about it.
[19:56] If I had told you then how would I have given you this surprise.
[20:00] And how would I have been able to see this happiness on my mother's face.
[20:04] Bless you. I pray that God gives you success.
Amen*
[20:12] Shall I serve lunch?
[20:13] Yes, after that I'll head on to Zara's home to give Zaini these sweetmeats.
[20:17] Sure... freshen up.
Take this... don't eat all of them
[20:29] What's the matter? What are you thinking?
[20:33] I was thinking... are we important to brother or them?
[20:39] Stop thinking such things and come on.
[20:45] I've announced my decision to everyone. I can't live without Aqib...
[20:50] I can't think of leaving.
Mirha please...
[20:53] Sister please... if you can't help me, then don't interfere in my business.
[20:59] Mirha!
[21:15] Why have you brought me here?
[21:18] I told you that you won't ask me any question.
[21:22] I promised, but that doesn't mean that you can take me anywhere.
[21:28] Just once come inside with me.
[21:32] I won't go inside
[21:35] Adnan... come inside. You'll fall in love with the kids inside.
[21:42] Are you insane? We don't know who their parents are and you've brought me here.
[21:48] What are you saying? Think before you speak.
[21:55] It's possible that God brought them into this world so that people like us can adopt them.
[22:07] I want to adopt a kid so that I can be a mother.
[22:12] Are you insane? You want to adopt a kid! Leave with me at once!
[22:18] I will not go...
Stop creating a scene... and come with me.
[22:22] Are you trying to find someone?
[22:23] No we are not. Are you coming or not?
I will not go.
[22:28] Come with me.
Listen to me.
[22:37] Why aren't you picking up my calls?
I was studying.
[22:41] Enough studying...
[22:44] Saad, my exams are about to start, what's the matter with you?
[22:48] Your real test is about to start with me.
[22:51]  focus on that, that's more important.
[22:56] Why would you care about what's important for me?
[23:00] Are you still upset with me?
[23:03] Did you have something for me?
[23:07] I did... I wanted to tell you something, but forget it.
[23:11] Wait... tell me what's the good news.
[23:18] I will not tell you. For you, your ego is more important than me.
[23:24] Are you telling me or not.
[23:26] On one condition. You will promise that you stop being upset with me.
[23:33] First tell me the news...
The news is that I've been hired.
[23:43] Really... yes... I've been hired.
[23:47] Congratulation!
You'll have to come with me.
[23:52] Where?
It's a surprise.
[23:59] Still tell me, where...
I'm waiting for you...
[24:04] Come on...
Umm... alright.
[24:30] What's the matter?
Mirha, where were you?
[24:34] I had a class.
You're lying. 
[24:38] I know you went to meet that guy.
[24:41] Sister, what's the matter with you?
What you're doing is wrong. 
[24:45] You have no relationship with that guy.
[24:50] You are betraying you family and you're not doing right by yourself.
[24:56] Then tell me if you have a way.
[24:59] It's better to know the path you are walking before you walk it.
[25:04] If you jump without thinking... then you fall off a cliff as well.
[25:08] Sister... one learns when when falls.
[25:11]  You and brother Adeel had your fair share of problems as well.
[25:15] Mirha... life isn't a competition.
[25:20] One has to think before making decisions.
[25:22] Then do it, who's stopping you from making decisions?
[25:26] You're the one who's delaying the decision. I've announced my decision to everyone.
[25:31] I can't live without Aqib and I can't even think about leaving him,
[25:36] Mirha please...
[25:37] Sister please... if you can't do anything about me, then no need to interfere in my business.
[25:43] Mirha...
[26:04] How are you?
I'm well, thanks to God.
[26:08] I'm perfectly fine.
[26:10] You went through the trouble of coming here. You could have visited me at home.
[26:17] I'll will visit you soon.
[26:23] I wanted to talk to you about something.
Sure what is it?
[26:28] We like your daughter Mahi for my nephew Zaviar.
[26:41] It's been a while since I heard good news.
[26:45] You will be getting even better news in the future.
[26:52] If God is willing.
[26:53] Joining a relationship with an honorable family like yours...
[26:59] has made me very happy... believe me...
[27:02] Anyone I've asked about you has testified about your honor.
[27:10] Brother Noor Alam God is the one who assigns respect
[27:17] Otherwise we sinners have no power over this.
[27:21] A man doesn't have power over anything,
[27:24] Of course, you are right.
[27:29] May God keep it this way and bless our children...
[27:35] with happiness.
Amen*
[27:40] Mr. Ahmed... I had a request...
[27:45] If you don't mind.
[27:49] What are you saying? Please speak your mind.
[27:55] Of course... thank you.
[28:01] Actually I didn't want to be so hasty in telling you this news, but what can I do...
[28:08] I am compelled by something.
Please speak openly...
[28:16] Mr. Ahmed...
[28:18] The thing is that...
[28:48] Greetings*
Where are you two coming from?
[28:56] What's the matter Shaista? Why are you crying?
[29:05] I took him to an orphanage to adopt a child
[29:11] But he refused... how is it my fault that God has deprived me of this blessing?
[29:19] I want to become a mother as well. I want there to be a child in my home.
[29:24] A child that would call me mother. But he refused, and humiliated me there.
[29:33] Enough... forget this for now if he's not listening to you.
[29:41] With time he might understand. Don't cry.
[29:48] These things are supposed to be left to God.
[29:53] Be patient my child.
[29:57] What are you saying? A marriage ceremony in a week?
[30:02] How can this be possible?
This is what they want.
[30:07] Make them understand then.
[30:08] I've asked them some time to answer them back.
[30:11] There is nothing to think about.
[30:15] This marriage is not possible. We don't accept their proposal. Refuse it!
[30:21] Look, decisions made in haste are detrimental.
[30:25] Ask this yourself, is what they're asking normal?
[30:30] Marriage aren't supposed to be done so quickly.
[30:32] Why not... Adeel's marriage was done like this as well.
[30:39] Come my dear... sit with us.
[30:46] I'll come back later uncle.
No my dear, you are part of this house.
[30:53] And it's important for you to be part of this discussion.
[31:01] Tell me Zara... how can the marriage be done so quickly?
[31:07]  They are forcing their decision on us.
[31:10] What should we do then? If we refuse then the proposal won't last.
[31:19] It is a good proposal, what will you do if we lose it?
[31:26] There is nothing wrong with my daughter. 
[31:29] We'll find a million proposals for my daughter.
[31:32] Alright you will... but what if they put the same condition forth?
[31:36] You just need an excuse to contradict me.
[31:41] Zara, am I wrong?
[31:45] I don't want things to be done in haste. But we have to look at their compulsion.
[31:52] Uncle, whatever decision you and auntie make will be the best for Mahi.
[32:00] Fareeda try to understand.
[32:04] Why don't you understand?
[32:07]  Not much time has passed since Adeel's demise.
[32:13] Why don't they understand this?
They are compelled.
[32:18] Then we are compelled too.
[32:21] Alright. I'll refuse. I'll ask them if they can extend the date, otherwise...
[32:28] we refuse.
Uncle, please don't refuse.
[32:33] Do what they're asking you to do?
[32:36] Zara, what are you saying?
[32:42] Auntie, Mahi will find a lot of guys, by a diamond is one in a million.
[32:49] They are good and honorable people.
[32:51]  The best thing is that both of them understand each other.
[32:55] We shouldn't refuse this relationship. 
[32:58] If you're worried about me, then don't be
[33:03] I will have no objections. I'm sure...
[33:09] if it were Adeel in my place he would have wanted Mahi to be happy.
[33:15] So please, don't refuse this proposal. 
[33:19] Call them and accept their proposal. Prepare for the marriage ceremony.
[33:28] Sure my dear... bless you.
[33:55] You forgot me as soon as you left. I was waiting for your call.
[33:59] It is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[34:02] Do you think that I'm not fond of you?
[34:08] Why would I think that?
Then why didn't you call?
[34:13] Ali I was busy.
You were busy?
[34:18] Where were you busy? May I ask?
Why should I tell you?
[34:22] Why would you tell me? Alright, I don't want to talk to you as well.
[34:28] Alright...
Ali...
[34:31] Ali... hello...
[34:34] See... look how you got worried. It only took you two seconds.
[34:40] What kind of childish behavior is this?
What about what you're doing?
[34:43] Will you take revenge from me?
[34:46] I will, if you give someone other than me, your time.
[34:50] What are you saying? I was busy with mother when we returned home.
[34:55] Brother Saad was just hired. 
[34:57] Mother made food and asked me to have it distributed in the mosque.
[35:00] That's what I was doing.
[35:05] That's great news. I'll ask Saad for a treat.
[35:11] There is no need to steal from my brother.
[35:13] I have a separate bond with your brother and a treat is in order.
[35:18] Listen, I will talk to mother and father tomorrow.
[35:25] About what?
About our marriage.
[35:29] But Ali... what will you do say if they ask the reason for your haste?
[35:34] Leave that to me. I'll handle everything. No one will ask you anything.
[35:41] Okay... farewell.
[36:17] What are you thinking?
[36:25] Fareeda...
[36:29] What are you thinking?
[36:37] I miss Adeel.
[36:45] If he was here today, he would have been so happy.
[37:16] Why are you silent?
[37:20] Don't you miss him?
[37:24] Not only mothers have the right to miss their children.
[37:30] I'm Adeel's father.
[37:33] I miss him very dearly.
[37:42] Then why don't you talk about him with me?
[37:49] I think...
[37:52] if I keep reminding you of him...
[37:56] then you will never be able to forget him.
[38:03] Who can forget their child?
[38:08] I miss him all the time.
[38:14] Do you know... whenever I see Zara...
[38:26] it reminds me of Adeel.
[38:39] Let me tell you one thing...
[38:44] I will never let Zara go away from here. I will always keep her here.
[38:50] Yes... if only you would have thought of that before.
[38:59] You're right.
[39:05] I was blind.
[39:15] I...
[39:17] I couldn't recognize Zara's goodness.
[39:23] When she talked about Mahi today...
[39:29] I was surprised.
[39:35] She...
[39:37] For Mahi, she chose Mahi's happiness over her sadness.
[39:48] Do you understand what I'm saying.
[39:52] I do understand... and I can see that you're changing slowly.
[40:00] I used to tell you that Zara's heart is pure.
[40:05] She doesn't have hatred for anyone.
[40:11] Yes.
[40:15] I was the one who didn't understand her.
[40:24] If only I...
[40:26] accepted Zara as Adeel's wife.
[40:34] If I had my son would have left this world happy.
[40:44] He was upset with me when he left, right Ahmed?
[40:48] He was upset with me when he left.
[40:53] You know that Adeel could never stay upset with you for long.
[40:59] You know that, right?
[41:03] Then by God's will, wherever he is...
[41:08] he must be smiling upon you.
[41:13] Yes.
