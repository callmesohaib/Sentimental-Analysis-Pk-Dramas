[00:24] you are so important for me, Saad
[00:27] I saw them together, I had explained you very well but you didn't understand me at all
[00:32] I had told you, not to leave Zara & Saad alone. Now Zara took your place
[00:38] for how many days we'll keep Adnan in this house?
[00:42] what?
[00:44] what is this?
[00:49] we can give this portion on rent to someone else
[00:53] dear, what's the bad quality in them?
[00:55] they are not only our tenants but relatives too. They are you distant uncle & aunt
[01:01] mom, they aren't our blood relatives
[01:11] I wanted to talk to you, dad
[01:13] yes, say it
[01:17] I was thinking to do the job
[01:21] job?
[01:23] yes
[01:24] but we are discussing your marriage here
[01:38] what is he saying, dad?
[01:40] sit down dear, lets sit & discuss this peacefully. Come sit
[01:45] sit down
[01:49] how can you guys even think of it? What are you saying? Why will I do second marriage?
[01:55] we haven't decided anything as of yet, we were just discussing. We cannot do anything without your consent
[02:03] I cannot give Adeel's place to someone else in my life
[02:07] Zara, dear your parents are thinking absolutely correct for you
[02:14] and we all know that you haven't forgotten Adeel as of yet
[02:18] nor you'll be able to forget him
[02:20] because Adeel & your relation was like that
[02:25] but my dear, also think that you've your entire life ahead. How will you spend it alone?
[02:34] have I become a burden?
[02:43] have I become a burden on you, dad?
[02:46] that's why you want to throw me off like this?
[02:49] No, its not like that you are thinking wrong dear
[02:52] then why dad?
[02:54] if you won't marry then what else you'll do, tell us
[02:59] you know how our society treats an alone woman
[03:03] be quiet!
[03:05] this is our personal matter, and you don't need to interfere. I am talking to my dad
[03:21] Zara...
[03:23] what's wrong dear, how are you talking?
[03:27] Zara, honestly you are so depressed
[03:32] you have forgot to respect your elders too
[03:35] I apologize to you on behalf of Zara
[03:38] brother, why are you apologizing?
[03:41] we should apologize
[03:44] she is saying the right thing, its your personal matter
[03:47] we shouldn't have interfered. We made a mistake
[03:50] we are sorry, please forgive us
[03:56] you guys can continue the discussion
 lets go Adnan
[03:59] lets go!
[04:01] Shaista..
[04:08] dear, nobody has stopped you for saying anything
[04:13] but whatever you want to say, if you'll say with respect then there would be no harm
[04:54] what happened to you?
[04:56] why are you sitting here?
[04:59] did something happen?
[05:02] I'm sitting here just like that
[05:04] nothing happened
[05:29] I've been saying this since beginning, that the girl is so cruel. She wasn't having an affair for no reason
[05:33] what was the need for you to discuss her marriage?
[05:36] be quiet, you won't understand
[05:38] I don't understand, what is going on in your mind
[05:41] I just want Zara to get married, what else?
[05:45] why do you want her to get married?
[05:47] you won't understand
[05:49] look at me
what is it?
[05:52] what is going on in your mind?
[05:54] whatever is going on in my mind, let it be
mind your own business!
[05:57] I am having headache, go bring tea for me
[06:00] now go!
[06:08] they have made my life a living hell!
[06:15] I will see you Zara
[06:19] I won't spare you
[06:21] you can change my name from Adnan, if I won't teach you a lesson
[06:37] I don't understand that why are we doing this discussion
[06:40] if Zara doesn't wants to marry then why are we forcing her?
[06:45] I am her father
[06:48] nobody knows what is good or bad for her, better than me
[06:54] I don't want to pressurize her for anything, nor I will do that
[06:57] neither I want her to wed her off tomorrow
[07:03] I just want her to start thinking about herself
[07:08] our life doesn't stops at one point, we should continue to live our life
[07:14] dad, you are right but...
[07:16] Zara will make this decision that what she needs to do next
[07:22] maybe you guys aren't understanding
[07:25] Adnan had just said it so that she can get remarried
[07:28] he just wanted her betterment, there is nothing wrong in it
[07:34] Zara is not a burden on me
[07:38] I can take care of her
[07:44] but if..
[07:47] we think about it, then this matter isn't wrong too
[07:50] its not like that this hadn't happened earlier ever
[07:57] she is already upset with you, since she heard it
[08:00] she won't agree ever
[08:03] I know she won't give Adeel's place to someone else
[08:08] but until when?
[08:11] I am not her enemy, I want her betterment
[08:16] It becomes so difficult to spend your life without a companion
[08:24] she has locked herself inside the room since we have discussed this matter in front of her
[08:29] she didn't come out of her room
[08:31] I think we should stop for some time, don't discuss this matter again
[09:18] are you upset with me?
[09:23] how can you do this to me, dad?
[09:29] when a father have the responsibilities of daughters, then he has to think this way
[09:35] Have I become a burden on you? You've got fed-up of me?
[09:39] how can you think this way?
[09:42] neither I can get fed-up of you, nor my daughters are burden on me
[09:48] I am just worried about you
[09:51] dad, why we have restricted our daughter's fate until marriage?
[09:56] they will be good luck if they got married, and if they don't get married then this society won't let them live
[10:01] why it is like that, dad?
[10:04] can't I spend my life with Adeel's memories?
[10:09] you won't be able to move ahead if you'll spend your life with Adeel's memories
[10:17] it happens this way, and this is the world my dear
[10:19] we have to move on after forgetting the memories
[10:22] and when I think...
[10:25] that you, mom & everyone are so worried because of me
[10:29] I feel so hurt, I feel so stressed
[10:32] all of you are my everything!
[10:36] please don't lock me with this chain of marriage
[10:39] allow me to do the job
[10:41] but dear...
[10:42] dad, please don't worry about my marriage
[10:44] I don't want my marriage to become my reason of living
[10:48] I want to do a job, dad. And for that I need your permission & trust
[10:54] you have always believed me
[11:00] do it once again
[11:03] please
[12:03] you have decided for the job & didn't even tell me
[12:07] Saad, you are forgetting that you had given me this suggestion
[12:10] I had said it like that, and you took it seriously
[12:13] Saad, now you are confusing me. Is this a wrong decision?
[12:17] I shouldn't have come into your words
[12:20] I am joking. You made the right decision on the right time
[12:23] sure?
[12:26] Okay, will you help me in finding the job?
[12:31] yes, why not. But on one condition
[12:33] first go & make me a cup of tea
[12:35] Zaini will make it, Saad
[12:37] why Zaini will make it? I want to drink the tea prepared by you. Its been too long that I haven't had tea prepared by you
[12:41] Ok, let me bring it in two minutes then you have to make my CV
[12:45] you have to make my CV then
[12:46] I'm waiting for you over here
Ok
[12:57] what are you doing?
[12:59] making tea for Saad
[13:02] let me make it
[13:04] No, I will make it
[13:06] he was saying that he wants to drink the tea prepared by me
[13:11] would you like to drink, shall I make some?
[13:15] No
[13:17] you guys shall continue
[13:31] Zaini..
[13:34] what are you doing, where are you going?
[13:37] actually I am going to do the studies
[13:39] dear, try to look after the kitchen too. I have some work in the kitchen
[13:42] why Zara is always working in the kitchen?
[13:45] will I be doing all the work alone once she goes to the job?
[13:48] all of you can only see Zara
[13:52] not me?
[13:54] what's wrong?
[13:55] what is this?
[13:56] mom, my exams are going on
[13:59] and nobody is concerned about it, whether the papers are going well or not
[14:04] nobody cares about it
[14:05] why we don't care? We do care about you too
[14:10] mom, don't give me false hopes
[14:12] I can see everything!
[14:15] you used to be concerned for Zara only, when she doesn't used to live here
[14:21] and now when she has come back here for lifetime
[14:25] even now everyone just thinks about only Zara
[14:28] nobody can see me
[14:31] Nobody gives importance to me
[14:33] and Saad
[14:38] he also doesn't cares about me
[14:40] what's wrong Zaini, what are you thinking?
[14:43] mom... I feel so bad
[14:47] when all of you ignore me
[14:51] specially when Saad ignores me
[14:56] Saad doesn't even care about me
[14:59] what's wrong speak softly, he will hear you
[15:02] See!
[15:04] even now you are just worried that no one shall mind anything
[15:09] nobody cares about me! You guys don't see me at all
[15:14] Saad doesn't sees me at all, I am not important for you guys. I am not important for anyone
[15:21] nobody cares for me
Zaini.. .
[15:26] what's wrong with her?
[15:55] here is your tea
[15:57] thank you!
[16:05] Wow... amazing
[16:09] this is awesome! Tea should be like this
[16:13] look, I have shortlisted a job for you in a big company
[16:17] have a look..
[16:30] Saad, this is a very big company
[16:33] so what? You aren't some ordinary girl
[16:36] you had been a topper in your university
[16:38] that's right, but how can we apply in such a big company as I don't have any job experience
[16:44] we get experience by doing a job, we don't get it without applying
[16:48] and these are just rubbish things. To start some work one needs to start from the beginning
[16:53] try ironing people words, immediately start applying
[16:56] do you think I should apply?
[16:59] you should apply for sure, its such a good opportunity
[17:02] Okay
[17:04] show me
[17:09] so we have to fill all this information?
[17:11] we have to do this all, and I will do it
[17:14] Greetings!
[17:16] Greetings dad!
Greetings uncle!
[17:18] Greetings! Stay blessed dear. I saw you after so many days
[17:23] yes, how are you?
Fine?
[17:25] I am fine dear, so sorry to hear about your husband's accidental death
[17:29] and that accident..
[17:31] I felt so strange after listening to entire incident
[17:38] me & my wife couldn't believe. May God give you patience
[17:42] when did you come?
[17:44] just a while ago, uncle
[17:46] Zara, bring tea for us we are sitting
[17:48] please come
yes
[18:17] now they'll come back to their senses
[18:38] Zara
[18:40] yes?
[18:42] are you fine?
[18:43] I am fine, Saad
[18:48] I think you should go home
[18:50] but Zara why?
Zara..
[19:07] Saad doesn't come here for me
[19:11] he doesn't even remember that there is someone else in this house who waits for him
[19:16] if he comes here, then he comes only for one person
[19:22] and that is you, Zara
[19:44] so sorry to hear about your husband's accidental death
[19:47] and that accident..
[19:49] I felt so strange after listening to entire incident
[19:53] me & my wife couldn't believe.
[20:03] you used to be concerned for Zara only, when she doesn't used to live here
[20:08] and now when she has come back here for lifetime
[20:12] even now everyone just thinks about only Zara
[20:43] so Zaini, how many of your papers are left?
[20:47] only one is left
[20:48] hmm...
[20:50] then my daughter will be free from studies, what have you decided for the future?
[20:55] dad, I will do masters
[20:58] great!
[20:59] ok tell me how are your papers going?
[21:04] will you pass them?
[21:06] what are you doing?
[21:08] why are you irritating my daughter?
[21:09] dad, I am just asking about her exams
[21:12] yes, they are going well
[21:15] only well? You have to do top
[21:20] like our Zara used to do
[21:28] brother, I am not Zara!
[21:30] what's wrong, you've become serious. We were just joking
[21:34] Zaini, please sit. Brother was just joking
[21:37] and we are sure that you'll get really good marks
[21:40] ok enough, be quiet now. Quietly do your breakfast, sit down Zaini
[21:46] mom, I am getting late. I am leaving
[21:48] Saad will come to pick you, right?
[21:53] No dad
[21:54] he doesn't have time anymore
[21:57] then let me drop you
[22:01] No I will go myself, I have become habitual of it
[22:04] Bye!
Zaini...
[22:07] Bye dear
bye!
[22:10] what do you do?
[22:11] dad, I was just asking about her papers. I was joking
[22:15] she has become quite sensitive nowadays. She forgot her mobile as well
[22:25] what's the matter, sister. You seem a bit worried
[22:28] No, I am not worried. Its just that I am not feeling well
[22:33] if you are feeling quite unwell then shall I take you to the doctor?
[22:37] no no, I will be fine
[22:40] I didn't see Adnan from the last 2 days, is he still upset with us?
[22:45] why he will be upset with you?
[22:48] actually sister, Adnan was suffering with fever
[22:52] that's why he didn't stepped outside the house, that's why you couldn't see him
[22:56] today he got a bit well so he had stepped outside the house & went to do some work
[23:01] Okay
[23:02] I thought maybe he has mind anything
[23:05] nowadays everyone gets upset on very small matters
[23:10] about whom you are talking?
[23:12] No, just like that
[23:16] sister, we are together since quite a long time
[23:22] if we ever had a misunderstanding, I try to remove it as soon as possible
[23:29] if misunderstandings stay for long time then it creates rift between our loved ones
[23:34] and who can stay happy while staying away from their loved ones
[23:40] you are right though
[23:47] did you talk to your brother?
[23:55] he calls me but... 
[23:58] I don't receive it
[24:02] you do the right thing
[24:05] at least, this way he will realize his mistake
[24:11] please try to take care of your health
[24:15] would you like to drink tea?
[24:16] No, leave the tea & just take care of yourself
[24:19] you are getting weak day by day
[24:22] I am fine
[24:25] not really, you don't seem fine to me
[24:41] oh Adnan, you are so nice
[24:44] you've brought me in the fresh air after such a long time, I am feeling so good. I am enjoying a lot
[24:48] you are so nice that my life is present for you, whenever you ask for it
[24:53] ok wait
[24:57] what are you doing?
[25:00] look, what I have brought for you
[25:02] its very pretty
[25:06] but its artificial, right?
[25:09] yes, its artificial. For now near with it
[25:13] what is this Adnan. You always give me artificial things
[25:17] I will bear it on one condition. First promise me that soon you'll gift me a gold chain
[25:23] I promise you that soon I will gift you a gold chain. Happy?
[25:28] Happy
[25:29] Ok tell me, what about your house which you were selling?
[25:33] which house?
[25:34] the same which you intend to sell off
[25:37] oh yes! that house? I have to sell it off
[25:40] the discussion is also going on. Lets see, when its going to get sold
[25:45] if you say so, then shall I try?
[25:47] why will you try? 
[25:49] I mean, you already have plenty of work to do. Why will you get worried for no reason
[25:54] leave my work. See, these are the work to be done by men. If you say so I can get it sold
[26:00] oh Adnan, I mean see... the property costs will increase now
[26:06] So... we'll sell it off at that time
[26:08] ok whenever you want to sell your house do let me know. I have a friend who is an estate agent, he will get you good price
[26:15] okay fine
[26:18] its such a scrumptious snacks!
[26:31] Zaini... 
[26:34] Zaini
[26:37] are you going to the university?
[26:40] I wanted to discuss something with you
[26:42] I am busy
[26:44] why are you avoiding me?
[26:47] is there anything in your heart related to me?
[26:50] there isn't any such thing
[26:52] so why don't you talk to me?
[26:55] earlier you used to share everything with me
[26:58] so why you've become so quiet?
[27:00] what difference does it make?
[27:01] it does make a difference, Zaini
it does make a difference to me 
[27:04] I have never seen you so upset & worried ever
[27:09] you always used to stay happy & smiling
[27:13] why you've become so upset now?
[27:16] well.. at least you can see
[27:18] it means there is some matter which has worried you
[27:23] am I the reason of that problem, Zaini?
[27:25] even if you are not the reason, Zara
[27:28] still you must be!
[27:31] what does this mean Zaini, what have I done?
[27:35] nothing! just relax
[27:37] how can I do this Zaini? If there is any matter then tell me. Has Saad said something? Shall I talk to him?
[27:43] what will he say?
[27:46] he doesn't have anything to say
[27:49] and if he had something, then he wouldn't have talked to me
[27:53] he comes here for you Zaini, then why don't you ask him?
[27:57] for me?
[27:58] Saad doesn't come here for me
[28:02] he doesn't even remember that there is someone else in this house who waits for him
[28:08] if he comes here, then he comes only for one person
[28:14] and that is you, Zara
[28:17] he just comes here to talk to you
[28:21] he doesn't need me
[28:24] he never needed me
[28:27] do you know, he didn't even remembered this house address when you were not here
[28:33] he only wants to talk to you, Zara
[28:37] and you are saying that he comes here for me
[28:41] Zaini, Saad is my friend
[28:43] and I?
[28:46] who am I to him?
[28:49] you are taking it wrong Zaini, there isn't any such thing
[28:52] I've started to understand now
[28:58] come inside, lets sit & talk. Let me clarify your misunderstanding
[29:02] I don't want to talk to you about anything
[29:04] and I have a paper
[29:06] Zaini
Zaini!
[29:26] I have made your CV, also forwarded it too
[29:29] I am sending it to you, check it
[29:31] there is no need of it, Saad
[29:34] I don't want to apply
[29:36] Zara, we don't take people words so seriously
[29:39] its people habit to taunt
[29:41] its us who gave a chance to the people
[29:44] no matter by stupidity
[29:47] but we do make a mistake
[29:48] Zara... you'll find such people at every corner who will become an obstacle on your way
[29:54] so will you change your path by getting afraid of every obstacle?
[29:57] I don't know
[30:00] what is my destination
[30:02] I've become lost in the desert
[30:06] and I can't see anyone at all
[30:08] Zara, you don't seem fine to me
[30:11] I am coming to meet you
[30:12] No Saad, please don't come. Ever...
[30:15] Zara, why are you saying like this?
[30:17] sometimes we have to leave our friends in order to save our relations
[30:21] from where our friendship came in between?
[30:23] and I don't understand, what is going on in your mind
[30:26] about what you are upset
[30:28] I am not upset on anything, Saad
[30:30] has anyone said anything to you? Tell me the truth
[30:32] why anyone will say anything to me?
Nobody has said anything, Saad
[30:36] mom is calling me. I will talk to you later, bye!
[30:41] Zara! listen to me. Zara!
[30:46] Zara... hello?
[31:23] you have retaliated to me on Saad's matter
[31:26] I like it
[31:31] see, I am your husband
[31:34] but its not like that you agree with me on every matter
[32:51] are you okay?
[32:55] yes teacher
[32:57] focus on your paper
[33:52] really! When is the engagement?
[33:54] its on Saturday. And aunty has specially invited you
[33:58] yes yes, why we won't come? We will come for sure
[34:01] ok tell me, are you happy dear?
[34:05] I hope they aren't annoying you now
[34:08] No mom, they have changed a lot. And honestly speaking, sometimes I don't believe it
[34:14] that they are the same people, who had forgotten me after sending me off to my parents house
[34:18] did you see, dear?
[34:20] sometimes, how its better to leave your ego & bow down in front of someone 
[34:26] you decided to go back to your house, so they have changed too
[34:30] now if they are accepting you from the bottom of their heart
[34:34] then you shall also now leave amiss
[34:36] mom, you are always afraid that what if I come back to you once again
[34:41] No.. what's there to be afraid of? Its your own house
[34:46] I just want all of my daughters to stay happy in their husband's house
[34:52] how is Zara now, mom?
[34:55] Zara is fine, she is thinking to do the job
[34:58] job?
[35:00] she is thinking to do the job?
[35:03] who gave her the permission to do the job, mom?
[35:06] your father did, and then its good that this way she will divert her mind. What she will do by staying at home?
[35:11] but dad had never allowed me to do the job
[35:14] your matter was different dear, you didn't even completed your studies. In your last semester... 
[35:19] yes yes mom I remember. Don't make me recall old matters please
[35:23] ok leave this topic & tell me. At what time we have to come?
