[00:21] Zara is alright.
[00:24] But my brother has gone.
[00:29] My brother has left this world.
[00:33] Please bring water.
[00:36] Bring water. Hurry up.
[00:38] Zara please open your eyes.
[00:41] Adeel I kept telling you but you didn't listen to your mother.
[00:47] If he had listened to me then he would have been alive today.
[00:50] I kept telling everyone that she is accursed but no one listened to me.
[01:07] Mom, eat a bit.
[01:12] No Mahi, I don't want to eat anything.
[01:18] Mom, Adeel won't come back if you won't eat anything.
[01:23] He has gone to that place from where no one can come back.
[01:28] Why didn't she go?
[01:31] Why did my Adeel go?
[01:35] He didn't have to go yet. He had to live more.
[01:40] Why did he go?
[01:43] Mom please eat a bit
[01:46] Control yourself.
[01:48] If you won't control yourself then who will take care of us.
[01:53] Adeel won't come back mom.
[01:56] Please eat for my sake.
[01:57] Why isn't anyone saying anything to her because of whom he has left this world.
[02:04] My Adeel had to live more.
[02:12] He had to become father and I had to become a grandmother.
[02:20] This wicked girl has killed my son.
[02:27] This child eating witch has killed my son.
[02:33] She killed my son.
[02:37] Dad, mom isn't eating any thing. Please take care of her.
[02:44] Let me see Mirha.
[02:51] Don't do this Farida. Eat something.
[02:58] Are you happy now.
[03:01] Are you in peace now?
[03:04] Your niece came to this house
[03:09] And my son has gone.
[03:15] Fear God. Fear God.
[03:21] It's not good to criticize God's will.
[03:28] Be thankful to God that He gave us that much time to fulfill our son's desires.
[03:40] He had to live that much.
[03:47] He had to leave this world.
[03:50] But it's not good.
[03:55] This is really bad.
[04:00] My son has gone. How will I live without him.
[04:07] Someone bring my son back.
[05:21] I can't see Zara in this condition.
[05:28] How happy she was on her wedding day.
[05:34] And everything has changed in a single day for her.
[05:44] The meaning of life has been changed for her now.
[05:53] I don't know how will she be able to adjust with this situation.
[06:01] We won't let her live here.
[06:05] We will take her back with us.
[06:09] Yes, she will go with us.
[06:12] How can she live here.
[06:28] Despite everyone's opposition, the person she married is no longer here.
[06:41] And when we told her that she won't live happily in her in-laws house
[06:46]  then do you know, what did she say?
[06:55] She said that if Adeel is with her then she doesn't care about anyone.
[07:05] She thought that she has got the most valuable thing with her and that is love.
[07:10] Adeel's love. But she was wrong.
[07:16] The biggest reality is death.
[07:22] Which doesn't see that how much a person loves other person.
[07:29] And how many dependents he has.
[08:02] Zara.
[08:06] Zenny, this dress is for Zara.
[08:10] Ask her to change it and bring her out. People are coming for condolence. 
[08:13] You come as well.
[08:21] Change your dress.
[08:26] Let me hang it.
[10:41] Mom, your health will deteriorate. Bring water for mom.
[10:47] Mom, stop crying.
[10:53] Mom, please.
[10:57] Mom, stop crying.
[11:17] How is mom feeling now, Dolly?
[11:22] Zara's condition is not good.
[11:26] I will ask Zenny to tell Zara to talk to you.
[11:41] I will talk to you later Dolly. Good bye.
[12:11] Why did you disconnect the phone?
[12:13] I had to talk to Saad.
[12:16] Mom, I couldn't talk to him properly.
[12:18] Some came there so he disconnected the phone. Talk to him later.
[12:23] What did he say about Zara? How is she?
[12:27] She is not in good condition. She is still in shock.
[12:30] Yes, she has faced such torment.
[12:33] It's a very big test for her.
[12:37] May God give her patience.
[12:39] Ameen.
[12:42] By the way, brother Saad told me that maybe they will bring her back.
[12:49] That will be good.
[12:50] She will have support of everyone here otherwise she wouldn't forget her past while living there.
[12:58] It's a very big shock for her.
[13:00] Who can know about it more than me.
[13:04] Wife feels courageous if she has support of her husband.
[13:07] And when she loses this support
[13:10] Then everyone gets finished and woman feels lonely.
[13:17] May God have mercy on her.
[13:22] Everyone's focus must be on her, specially her mother-in-law.
Mom.
[13:28] I think after this incident, her hatred must have become more intense.
[13:37] May God have mercy on her.
[13:54] What is going on here?
[13:58] Nothing.
[14:00] Don't you know that your Iddat period has started?
[14:06] I think you must have known about difference of forbidden relations.
[14:10] Aunt, actually.
You are still standing here.
[14:18] Didn't you listen that her Iddat period has started. Go from here.
[14:27] Go.
[14:48] The girls of noble and honorable families can't even see face of forbidden relatives.
[14:57] And you are sharing your feelings with him.
[15:01] Are you ashamed?
[15:08] Go to your room and don't come out of your room.
[15:13] Do you understand?
[15:19] Go.
[15:52] Is anyone aware that where is Zara right now?
[15:57] What happened? Where is Zara?
[15:59] She is with Saad.
[16:03] Didn't she fall in love with Adeel?
[16:06] Hmm?
[16:08] She forgot him so soon.
[16:20] What are you talking about? Hmm?
[16:25] What do you mean by that?
[16:28] What do you mean by that? She is in her Iddat.
[16:32] She shouldn't meet any forbidden relative.
[16:38] She has forgotten Adeel so soon.
[16:42] Didn't anyone tell her.
[16:45] That what she has to do during her Iddat.
[16:50] Couldn't she sit in her room for a few days for the sake of Adeel.
[16:53] My son did so much for her, can't she do this much for him.
[16:59] This is not the right time to discuss this matter.
[17:03] We will advise her later. She is our child.
[17:06] Everyone knows about these matters Mr. Ahmed.
[17:12] But I think Zara don't care about it.
[17:16] It doesn't make any difference to her.
[17:20] She doesn't care about anything. She is not sad at all.
[17:26] You are talking weirdly.
[17:28] Will you learn to talk according to situation or not?
[17:32] You are asking me to do that and what about your niece?
[17:38] Don't you see what is she doing?
[17:41] Is she acting according to situation? Tell me.
[17:44] For God sake sister, please stop it.
[17:50] My daughter's life is already ruined. 
[17:53] She will do whatever you want and whatever you say.
[17:58] Your daughter's life isn't ruined Sarwat.
[18:03] This didn't make any difference to her.
[18:06] She will find a new husband for her.
[18:12] My life has ruined. I have seen with my own eyes.
I think it's enough.
[18:22] We are taking Zara with us. We should leave now.
[18:30] That will be a great favor on me from your side.
[18:33] For God sake, take your daughter to your home.
[18:38] There is so much difference between environments of your house and my house.
[18:44] How will I face people if she will do any wrong.
[18:53] Zenny, ask Zara to get ready, she will go with us.
[18:59] Let me tell her.
[19:01] Wait.
[19:03] Will you decide yourself?
[19:08] Won't you ask me?
[19:11] Zara is not my daughter-in-law, she is my daughter.
[19:21] Brother Manzoor, let her stay here for a few days.
[19:26] God has taken back my son.
[19:31] Let my daughter stay with me. My house will be deserted.
[19:40] Uncle.
[19:42] Don't be emotional. It will hurt everyone.
[19:47] It will especially hurt Zara.
[19:51] Please allow us to take her with us.
[19:54] My son, sit.
[19:57] Sit comfortably and talk. Brother Manzoor, please sit.
[20:01] I am really embarrassed in front of you.
[20:04] Please forgive me. Please sit.
[20:08] Sit.
[20:18] Brother Manzoor, you know Farida's nature.
[20:24] She just says without thinking. Please don't mind her words.
[20:32] What can I say?
[20:46] Why did you go to Zara?
[20:49] Don't you know about their nature?
[20:51] They mention all laws when they want to disgrace someone but they don't pray at all.
[20:56] I didn't go to meet her. She came in front of me. What would I do?
[21:01] Zenny, she is in stress and she needs our support.
[21:06] Do you know that what are they thinking about your support?
[21:10] Do have any idea that what has aunt Farida said in front of everyone?
[21:14] Whatever
[21:16] I don't care.
[21:22] OK
[21:25] The discussion is underway. We will take Zara back.
[21:47] If I can tolerate with Adeel's demise then I can endure everything.
[21:58] Don't come to meet me when you will go back.
[22:18] What have you done Adeel?
[22:22] You told me that you will take me to our new house.
[22:27] So, why have you left alone?
[22:33] Why didn't you take me with you?
[22:36] You left me alone Adeel.
[22:40] You kept mentioning about death.
[22:45] I thought that you just say that to tease me.
[23:00] But I didn't know that you kept telling me about my future.
[23:05] You were preparing me mentally.
[23:10] If I had any idea that you know everything then
[23:16] Then I would pray for your long life.
[23:20] I would tell God that I can't live without you Adeel.
[23:28] Tell Him, you are with God Adeel.
[23:32] Talk to Him and tell him that both of us had to live together.
[23:39] We want to live together. Tell Him that I want to be with you.
[23:45] How will I live without you Adeel. I won't be able to live.
[23:49] It's very difficult, it's impossible.
[24:24] Me and mom have decided that Zara should tell everyone about her decision.
[24:30] Whether she wants to stay here or go with you.
[24:36] We will ask her about her decision.
[24:40] And it doesn't make any difference to us that who is in front of us or not.
[24:45] So it would be better for you to just leave.
[24:47] You are so strange.
[24:49] I am just saying that Zara should make this decision by herself that she wants to stay here or there
[25:00] I will stay here.
[25:06] I can't leave this house.
[25:15] Me and Adeel only spent fifteen days together.
[25:26] The respect and love Adeel gave me during those fifteen days
[25:36] And took great care of me
[25:40] Maybe
[25:44] Husband and wife are unable to give that much love and respect to each other throughout their entire lifetime.
[25:56] I can't leave this house mom.
[26:01] Let me stay here till my Iddat.
[26:10] There are Adeel's memories in this house.
[26:15] Here is his fragrance.
[26:19] Here are his clothes and other things.
[26:25] Adeel has left us.
[26:30] But I can feel his presence.
[26:39] If I left this house mom
[26:42] Then I will lose that feeling.
[26:46] And I want to live with that feeling.
[26:53] How can I leave this house mom.
[27:02] I can't live without this feeling mom.
[27:12] How can I leave this house mom.
[27:53] Zara has clearly refused. 
[27:56] She wants to stay here.
[27:58] She doesn't want to go back with us.
[28:01] And what about all others? What did uncle say?
[28:07] Dad has said that Zara should do whatever she wants
[28:12] It's a foolish act from Zara.
[28:14] We should talk to her together.
[28:17] But dad says that this is the right way.
[28:21] Obligations are fulfilled like this.
[28:31] They will bother her so much.
[28:34] Despite knowing this, should we leave her in this house.
[28:41] So what can we do Saad?
[28:43] She doesn't want to go with us so please leave her on her will.
[29:00] What are you doing Zara? You should go with us.
[29:06] Your decision is not right.
[29:11] Stop worrying about me Saad.
[29:16] Everything is minimal in front of my sadness about Adeel.
[29:22] If I can tolerate with Adeel's death.
[29:25] Then I can tolerate with everything.
[29:33] Don't come to meet me when you will go back.
[30:29] I am unable to understand that what are you guys doing?
[30:35] I mean that do you understand the meaning of Zara's stay here?
[30:44] What are you talking about?
[30:47] So you tell me, what should I say?
[30:50] Do you understand anything that why she wants to stay here?
[30:56] She wants to stay here with her own consent. No one is forcing her.
[31:01] I want to understand that why isn't anyone forcing her?
[31:05] The situation was different earlier, try to understand Ali.
[31:14] By the way, it's her uncle's house as well.
[31:19] If you don't consider this house as her in-laws' house then it's her maternal house.
[31:24] You are saying this mom.
[31:27] I can't believe it.
[31:29] There is no need for this argument Maheen.
[31:33] It would be better to talk to Zara instead of arguing with us.
[31:37] Make her understand that no one is forcing her.
[31:41] And especially in this situation. It's not a minor thing.
[31:47] It's a major incident.
[31:49] She will take some time to recover from this.
[31:53] I know my daughter, she won't compose herself so soon.
[32:02] OK, let me talk to her.
[32:07] Please don't take tension.
[32:11] We are here.
[32:13] Nothing will go wrong with Zara.
[32:16] I am saying this to stop anything wrong to be done to her.
[32:20] But everyone understands my point after facing consequences. Right?
[32:28] Oh.
[32:32] Mom, please don't cry.
[32:38] Someone should stop her.
[32:40] She just says without thinking.
[33:01] What do you want?
[33:04] Nothing.
[33:07] What are you talking about?
[33:09] Why don't you want to go with us?
[33:11] You shouldn't stay here now.
[33:15] Why should I stay here?
[33:18] Because I am saying this to you being your elder sister. Isn't this enough for you.
[33:24] I must have been saying this thoughtfully.
[33:59] Here you go.
[34:02] Here are your vegetables.
[34:05] Don't you need anything.
No, uncle Adnan.
[34:08] Did you talk to them, when will they come.
[34:12] Didn't you talk to Ali?
[34:14] No, I didn't talk to him.
[34:16] Bring me a glass of water.
OK.
[34:21] Ali should take care of you and he should inform you. After all he is your future husband. Hmm.
[34:26] Uncle Adnan, you know Ali's nature. He is like this.
[34:34] You will become husband and wife in future so you take care of your relation. You will face problems in future.
[34:42] He is only brother of three sister. You will mind my words but it's my duty to tell you.
[34:48] Even your real brother gives them more importance so be careful.
[34:54] What are you talking about uncle Adnan.
[34:57] It doesn't make any difference to me that you call me uncle Adnan.
[35:01] I consider you my friend and I will keep considering you my friend 
[35:04] and I was advising you being your friend.
[35:07] OK, tell me, when will then come. I have to cook the food.
[35:11] Cook the food, you have already cleaned the house. Right?
[35:14] And if you need anything else then tell me.
OK. Thanks uncle Adnan.
[35:23] I am going.
[35:25] Your uncle Adnan is going.
[35:33] So much has happened but you didn't even inform me.
[35:38] How could I inform you, your phone was not accessible.
[35:42] Oh yes, my phone was malfunctioning. I got it repaired today.
[35:46] I didn't have any idea that you are so much pain otherwise I wouldn't leave you alone.
[35:53] How are you feeling now?
[35:55] How can a sister feel after leaving her brother.
[36:00] I can understand your feelings.
[36:03] I am really sorry for that.
Don't cry.
[36:09] You know that it hurts me when I see you cry.
[36:13] Mirha please. I can't see you cry. I can come to you if you ask me.
[36:19] Do you love me that much Aqib?
Test my love.
[36:24] A love that is not tested is not called love
[36:27] You know what Aqib, I think that
[36:30] God has put sister-in-law in great test by taking brother's life.
[36:36] Brother loved sister-in-law from his heart and soul.
[36:41] And you remember that I used to give you examples of my brother and sister-in-law's love.
[36:45] Yes I remember everything. How is your sister-in-law feeling now?
[36:49] How she should be. She doesn't talk much.
[36:54] She just responds if anyone talks to her otherwise she keeps quiet.
[36:59] Aunt decided to take her back.
[37:02] So will she go back?
No.
[37:06] She will pass her Iddat period here.
[37:11] That's good.
[37:14] Anyways, I will talk to you later.
[37:19] Mirha take care of yourself. You have to live your life.
[37:23] Yes. Don't worry. Good bye.
