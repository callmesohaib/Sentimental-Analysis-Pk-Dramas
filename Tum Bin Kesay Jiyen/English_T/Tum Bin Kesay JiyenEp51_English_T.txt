[00:11] I used to tell Saad to stay away from Zara, as I don't like it
[00:17] but he didn't listen to me at all, mom 
[00:21] Saad never loved me Saad, mom 
He had always loved Zara
[00:25] if you had to marry this guy then why did you get married to my son?
[00:30] why you did a false drama of love with him? Why you did false promises? 
[00:35] tell me
[00:36] aunty please believe me I've done nothing. 
[00:39] even today I love Adeel. I haven't done anything
[00:42] Zara wanted to meet you
[00:47] but I don't want to meet her
[00:52]  she is our bloodline, Mr. Manzoor
[00:56] this is the reason I am disappointed
[01:04] that how can my bloodline be so dirty?
[01:17] Mahi, how much time will you take more?
[01:19] only 5 minutes, mom
[01:21] be quick, your father had asked almost twice
[01:24] what's wrong mom? I have only 2 hands, I cannot work more quickly than this
[01:28] if you'll use your tongue a bit less then you'll be able to work quickly
[01:32] here, its done. Take it with you
[01:34] Listen, since you've prepared the breakfast so go & serve it to your father. Ok?
[01:39] if he asks about me then tell him that I am working in the kitchen & very busy
[01:43] what's wrong? Why are you hiding from dad?
[01:46] what's wrong? What if your aunt calls your father & tell him that we had visited them yesterday
[01:53] so the way your father will treat us then, you'll get to know that!
[01:57] oh God mom, you are so afraid of him though!
[02:00] when you've already jumped into the battlefield then there is no use of sitting like a coward
[02:04] you should stay firm & compete
[02:06] Enough! Go & tell such big things to someone else. I am feeling afraid
[02:13] don't know why did I go there upon your words
[02:16] don't know why are you being afraid
[02:18] dad won't call her, nor aunt will call him
[02:21] What?
[02:22] how can you be so sure?
[02:25] whatever we did with aunt, she wouldn't have come out of the grief as of yet
[02:30] yes...
[02:32] she got so much insulted though
[02:34] and of that guy too
[02:36] did you see, how he was showing his eyes
[02:40] I felt like scratching off his eyes
[02:44] we have ruined that poor guy's honor, at least let his eyes be with him
[02:49] Poor... to hell with such poor people. May God save us from such poor people
[02:55] Okay pick it up & serve him
[02:57] I am taking out the tea, please go & take this to him
[02:59] I am not taking it there, you shall serve him
[03:02] let me make the tea, then I will let you know. You can come outside & take it from me
[03:07] make my breakfast too, I will have an omelet
[03:08] Ok ok, go..
[03:12] what if our secret gets exposed
[04:59] Adnan
[05:02] yes brother?
[05:03] are you going somewhere?
[05:04] yes, I am going out to do some work
[05:08] what happen, are you fine?
[05:10] yes, its fine
[05:14] go, you must be getting later
[05:15] No, its not that important. Actually Shaista has asked me to bring a few things. So I will bring them in a while, you tell me
[05:21] nothing just...
[05:23] I wanted to apologize to you
[05:27] that you have to face a lot of humiliation because of my children
[05:30] oh brother Manzoor, why are you embarrassing me.
 Don't worry, you will forget this after a few days
[05:35] I can't
[05:37] brother, you have to forget it
[05:39] after all, you have to bring that family's daughter in your house as your daughter-in-law. So you have to face them as well
[05:43] Its my compulsion, Adnan
[05:47] I don't want to give the punishment of the wrong doings of both of them to that poor girl
[05:51] that girl shouldn't get the punishment though, the entire fault is of Saad. So he should be punished
[05:55] I know all of this is done by him
[05:58] you should have told me all of this prior
[06:01] brother, how could I have told this? He was the to-be son-in-law of this family
[06:05] I could have done something at that time
[06:07] I could have saved my Zaini from that guy
[06:11] yes, honestly a lot of injustice is done with Zaini
[06:14] but don't worry, everything will be fine
[06:18] but still, please forgive me because you've been insulted a lot in my house
[06:23] brother, you are embarrassing me. You have always supported me in my bad times
[06:29] now let me give a chance to serve you as well
[06:34] you come to put salve on my wounds even after so much of disgrace
[06:38] may God bless you with long life
[06:41] go, we'll talk later
don't worry
[07:10] Saad has gone to this office today without having breakfast?
[07:14] yes mom
[07:16] so dear, you should have stopped him
[07:18] I had tried mom, but he left before I could complete my sentence
[07:27] my child...
[07:30] he didn't had anything since past 2 days
[07:37] today is first day of Zara's wedding
[07:44] I had quite a lot of desires, that I will do my son's wedding with complete pageantry
[07:51] but all the desires have gone in vain
[07:55] you are hurting yourself, mom
[07:58] try to forget all this
[08:01] Yes... you are right
[08:16] Okay, did you speak to Ali?
[08:19] No... and I won't talk to him
[08:22] why?
[08:24] mom, why shall I talk to him? He can also talk to me
[08:28] dear, what's wrong? He is your husband
[08:32] talk to him, try to appease him
[08:36] I won't appease him
[08:37] he did a mistake so he should come to appease me
[08:40] Dolly, why are you making it a matter of your ego?
[08:51] mom, what else I should do?
[08:53] its not my mistake
[08:56] if I will wed off from this house then only on one condition. 
They shall come here & apologize to us
[09:05] otherwise, I am very happy here mom
[09:25] everything got ruined because of me
[09:28] everyone's life got disturbed because of me
[09:54] Saad & Zaini's relation also broke because of me
[09:58] and now
[09:59] Dolly & brother Ali's relation also got spoiled because of me
[10:04] what shall I do, God?
[10:06] how shall I fix everything?
[10:26] mom... I am going to my house as I have to do the engagement preparations
[10:31] and I cannot ask Usama to stay here anymore
[10:35] He is asking me to go back home since so long
[10:39] yes, Okay dear. Go & take care of your home
[10:43] there must be a lot of work pending
[10:45] after all, its a wedding house
[10:51] mom
[10:53] I want to discuss something important with you
Zaini's condition is in front of you
[10:59] now don't say anything in front of us due to which she becomes more worried
[11:08] true that
[11:11] Okay
[11:13] I will take care of it
[11:16] Ok but where is Ali? I can't see him. I've been looking for him since so long
[11:22] he has gone to his office dear, he wasn't ready to go
[11:26] Your father had explained him a lot, then he went
[11:28] by the way mom, don't you think that you people shall think once before bringing Dolly to our house after her wedding?
[11:38] I mean... Zaini, Zara & Saad will face each other once again
[11:45] and Zaini's mental condition is in front of you. She is already quite distressed
[11:50] She won't be able to tolerate it
[11:54] dear, your father & I are here. We'll see what needs to be done
[11:59] we will tell you as well
[12:00] Ok?
[12:03] Okay fine, I am leaving then. Bye!
[12:06] let me come & meet Usama to say Good bye!
[12:09] Okay
[12:16] Zara
[12:19] yes aunty?
[12:21] until when you'll keep sitting inside the room? Come outside
[12:25] I am fine here, aunty
[12:28] you've been married now
[12:31] it would be better for you to accept this reality as soon as possible
[12:35] the way we have accepted
[12:37] do you also think that I..
[12:41] I don't want to hear anything else now
[12:45] whatever happened at your house yesterday, it shouldn't have happened
[12:50] but still, I came here to call you
[12:53] because neither I have forgotten humanity nor favors
[12:58] intentionally or unintentionally, you've become the daughter-in-law of this house
[13:02] now we don't have any other option except for fulfilling this relation
[13:07] but remember one thing, Zara
[13:10] if my daughter's life got ruined because of you
[13:15] then I won't let you stay in this house too
[13:19] I will oust you immediately from here, got it?
[13:23] it would be better for you to talk to your family
[13:27] to take away Dolly from here after the wedding reception as soon as possible
[13:32] because we have accepted your brother's condition. That's it!
[13:38] Aunty, nobody wants to talk to me over there
[13:41] even my son was innocent
[13:43] he was saying it loudly that he did nothing, he is completely innocent
[13:49] but your family didn't listen to him at all
[13:52] they have already punished Saad for it
[13:55] so now, will my daughter also bear all these pain because of you?
[14:00] no aunty, what are you saying?
[14:02] Fine! then talk to your family
[14:05] to take away Dolly from here after the wedding reception as soon as possible
[14:12] otherwise, it won't be good
[15:04] Excuse me!
[15:06] in what thoughts you are lost?
Come, lets go
[15:17] what happened? You seem worried
[15:20] I'm just tired
[15:22] then lets go home, everyone has gone
[15:26] has everyone left?
[15:29] yes, everyone has gone. Only you are sitting in the office
[15:33] I didn't realize about the time
[15:35] you are talking like a lost lover
[15:39] usually lovers wants to stay in this manner, totally cut off from this world
[15:45] its not necessary
[15:50] few of them had suffered due to their fate too
[15:54] what do you mean?
[15:56] No.. nothing!
[15:59] do you intend to stay at office or you would like to go home?
[16:02] you go, I am coming in just 2 minutes

[20:19] in fact, you've taken away the hope from me for staying alive
[20:26] Saad, my life is incomplete without you

[20:36] Saad, you have betrayed me. I will never forgive you for this
[20:46] Saad, I am going away
[20:50] I am going away from the lives of both of you
[20:54] you will never see my face again, Saad
[21:27] Zaini!

[22:03] Saad, my life is incomplete without you
[22:10] What will I do now by staying alive?
[22:14] Saad, you have betrayed me. I will never forgive you for this
[22:24] Saad, I am going away
[22:28] I am going away from the lives of both of you
[22:33] you will never see my face again, Saad

[22:40] Saad, what is she saying?
[22:44] Saad, call Zaini. Has she gone mad or what?
Why is she talking so silly, call her Saad

[27:43] Okay, as you wish
[27:45] tell Zaini to come & have dinner with us
[27:48] until when she'll keep hurting herself?
[27:51] I had asked her, but she said that she is not hungry
[27:54] at least, she can come & sit here if she is not hungry. She can have something whenever she feels like
[27:59] at least she should come & sit here
[28:02] bring her over
[28:04] Okay, let me see what she says
[28:13] Zaini..

[33:06] doctor, have you guys started her treatment?

[34:24] mom, where they have gone at this hour?
[34:27] they have gone to the hospital
[36:39] hello Ali, where are you? I've been calling you continuously but your number is coming to be busy
[36:45] Dolly, if something happens to Zaini then I won't leave your brother!
[36:53] and I will forget that what relation you & I have
[37:00] Ali... 
[37:02] Ali?
[37:04] Ali!
[37:07] what happened? is everything fine?
[37:09] what did Ali said?
[37:12] mom, Ali had made me realize my worth
[37:15] what?
[37:17] what did he said to you?
[37:18] he was saying, if anything happened to Zaini then he will forget what relation he & I have
[37:25] mom, what is my fault?
[37:28] but why is he saying this?
[37:30] I don't understand mom
[37:33] after all, a sister has to bear the consequences of whichever mistakes her brother did
[37:40] I have to give sacrifices
[37:42] enough dear
[37:45] be quiet, please don't cry
[37:49] don't know whomsoever have to bear the consequences of his actions
[37:52] even if Zaini has committed suicide then I haven't asked her to go & die
[37:56] what is my fault that I have to bear all this?
[38:00] control yourself dear, what's wrong with you?
No mom
[38:04] its not my fault, mom
[38:07] I don't deserve all this, I don't understand
[38:12] I don't have any fault still they are taking revenge from me
[38:15] you know I have always considered Zaini as my very good friend. I have always been her well wisher
[38:23] even I am not liking it whatever injustices are happening with her
[38:26] how can I think bad about her mom, but still... 
[38:30] still nobody can see that
[38:32] nobody can see that!
[38:34] dear, whatever Ali had said. He must have said it in anger
[38:42] Mom, so why am I being hanged on the gallows? Why I am being punished?
[38:47] I was nowhere in all this
[38:49] Dolly, get a grip on yourself & try to understand the delicacy of this time
[38:53] this is not the right time to discuss such things
[38:57] but mom... 
don't bring such things in your heart
[39:02] you have to make Ali believe that you are with him
[39:06] how can I make him believe it, mom?
[39:08] how shall I do it? Didn't you see what he had said?
[39:12] He had said it all in front of you
[39:15] forget it dear, just forget it
No... 
[39:17] I cannot forget it
[39:19] Enough Dolly! Just forget these things & let it be
[39:23] Ali has considered this relation so weak. Am I a joke?
[39:28] am I a joke for Ali, mom?
[39:30] everything will be fine once Zaini will be alright
[39:33] even yours & Ali's relation will become fine
[39:36] its very important for Ziani to become well. 
[39:39] dear, I am saying the right thing
[39:42] it will be very good for us if Zaini gets well
[39:47] pray for her long & healthy life
[39:49] don't know what that poor girl had suffered with that she took such a big step
[39:54] but what was my fault mom.. 
[40:01] what was my fault?
[40:05] I have done nothing, mom
[40:09] mom, I love Ali
[40:17] enough, please don't cry
[40:34] mom...
