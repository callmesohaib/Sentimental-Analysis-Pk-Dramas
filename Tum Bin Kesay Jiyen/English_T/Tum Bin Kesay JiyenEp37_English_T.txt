[00:12] how's Zara?
And how did it happen?
[00:16] how would I know? When I went to the kitchen in the morning I saw Zara lying on the floor
[00:22] I had told you to bring her to me
[00:26] don't let her stay there in this condition, as they won't be able to take care of her
[00:31] but you didn't listen to me, now see
[00:34] did you see what oppression they did?
They took away the last hope of my daughter from her
[00:41] what do you think? That you will roam around with some girl & nobody will get to know about it?
[00:48] what rubbish you are uttering? What non-sense? Which girl?
[00:53] rubbish?
[00:56] you also know that I am not talking rubbish
[01:07] mom
[01:10] I think, we should postpone the wedding
[01:15] and stay here for a few days with Zara
[01:19] and then we'll take Zara along with us
[01:22] No no... the doctor has strictly advised bed rest for Zara
[01:28] I don't think so that we should take this risk
[01:31] dad, also look that Zara had been through such a big incident
[01:36] and I won't look good while celebrating my happiness
[01:43] I am also concerned about Zara
[01:46] I think Ali is right
[01:50] we should postpone the wedding
[01:53] you are making a hasty decision. We don't make such decisions hastily
[01:58] besides, Saad's family is also associated with us
[02:01] we have shown hurry in the wedding and now we shall postpone it?
[02:05] why are you saying this? They aren't any strangers
[02:09] I will talk to sister Asifa
[02:12] she will understand our point, also Saad will understand as well
[02:16] try to understand my point
[02:19] you can understand the meaning of delaying the marriage very well
[02:24] people will make various gossips about Dolly
[02:27] already there are rumors that why we've kept the wedding all of a sudden
[02:32] and now when we'll postpone it, then the matter will be exaggerated for no reason
[02:41] well, we will stall our relatives by making some excuse. But they are bride's family, think about them
[02:50] So, let do one thing. Lets do the nuptial vows now
[02:55] we'll do the wedding reception once Zara will get well & come home
[03:00] yes... I don't have an objection on this. What do you say, Ali?
[03:09] Ok dad, if both of you are saying this then I don't have any issue
[03:14] this is appropriate
[03:17] Okay
[03:30] Saad!
[03:34] are you going somewhere?
[03:38] yes, I am going home
[03:41] you should have stayed for some more time
[03:50] won't you say anything?
[03:56] I know you are worried for Zara
[04:14] this isn't right, Zaini
[04:17] this shouldn't have happened
[04:21] yes
[04:24] this shouldn't have happened
[04:27] but maybe, its written in her fate
[04:33] how much more pains she'll face, Zaini?
[04:39] I can't tolerate it while listening to it, and there she must be suffering all alone
[04:45] why are you getting so worried?
[04:50] I mean, my mom & dad are with her
[04:55] well... you should go & rest as its quite late night. I am also going home
[05:44] when did you come back home?
[05:46] mom, I got a bit late at night
[05:49] by the way, there is one thing dear. Your in-laws are quite unlucky people
[05:53] no happiness suits them
[05:56] what's wrong with you mom that too early morning? At least let brother have breakfast
[06:00] yes, let him do the breakfast. I haven't stopped him
[06:03] and why are you stopping me? I am saying the right thing
[06:06] they hardly produce any offspring. One daughter was pregnant & now she had a miscarriage too
[06:11] and your brother-in-law, whenever his marriage discussion happens. Something or the other thing went wrong
[06:17] God knows about the youngest one...
[06:19] mom, what are you saying? Have your breakfast
[06:25] ok listen! I must say you shouldn't visit there regularly. It affects badly
[06:30] also tell your wife to come with me for the treatment
[06:33] you can see how difficult it is to get pregnant in their family
[06:38] and you'll discuss all these things with Maheen, understand?
[06:43] okay
[06:51] brother, pass me the jug
[07:03] take care
[07:08] dad, mom.. lets go. I have kept the luggage, be quick else there will be so much of traffic
[07:15] Okay then
[07:18] we'll come soon to get Zara
[07:21] Sarwat, don't worry...
[07:27] I will personally come to drop your daughter to your house
[07:34] Ok sister, bye!
[07:38] bye!
[07:43] bye uncle
[08:13] Sarwat didn't even greet me before leaving
[08:19] she is upset with me
[08:22] I couldn't take care of her daughter
[08:28] what happened, are you fine?
[08:32] I am fine
[08:34] what will happen to me?
[08:37] I am still alive even though a lot had happened
[08:42] I should have died
[11:21] here you go brother, your tea
[11:27] brother?
[11:32] brother!
[11:36] your tea, then you'll say that it got cold
[12:24] Mahi! Mahi, I am talking to you
[12:28] get up! Come with me
[12:30] where?
[12:31] come & apologize to Zara
[12:33] why shall I apologize?
[12:35] I hardly talk to her, then why shall I go to her & apologize?
[12:39] Mahi, its been a week now
[12:41] until when you'll keep hiding your sin?
[12:44] neither you have any realization, shame or regret on your face
[12:50] Zara keep crying in her room all the time
[12:54] she didn't complain to anyone, not even once
[12:58] neither she had complained to your father about you
[13:00] so she haven't done any favor on me
shut your mouth!
[13:04] stop your rubbish!
[13:06] because of you, I couldn't accept Zara as my daughter-in-law till date
[13:10] my son had left this world after getting upset from me, & I couldn't do anything!
[13:15] your wedding was called off, I agree. I accept it
[13:18] but still, she isn't capable enough to get such a big punishment Mahi
[13:22] not only you took your revenge from her
[13:27] in fact, you've ruined my hopes too Mahi!
[13:30] you have gone to far in your revenge, that you've murdered Zara's baby
[13:35] and you don't realize it at all
[13:38] Mahi!
[13:40] what have you done?
[13:42] Ahmed! 
you've ruined Zara's life
[13:46] you've done such a big injustice with her
[13:48] get out of here. get out!
Ahmed, what are you doing?
[14:00] dad, leave me?
Ahmed!
[14:02] you cannot live in this house anymore
[14:04] Ahmed...
get out of here!
[14:05] dad...
I said, get out!
[14:08] what are you doing, Ahmed?
[14:10] you are ousting your young daughter from the house, where will she go?
[14:13] did she left us capable enough to face anyone?
[14:16] first, she got me humiliated in the entire world and then she ruined Zara's life
[14:23] She has finished the last memorable of her brother as well
[14:27] You cannot live in this house
Get out!
[14:29] uncle, what are you doing?
Leave Mahi
[14:33] what are you doing?
[14:34] Zara, you are still favoring her although she did so much with you
[14:40] you are siding her why? Tell me why?
[14:44] uncle, whatever had to happen with me has happened already. Nothing can be done now
[14:53] you are ousting me from this house because of her
[14:57] I am your child, your own daughter
[15:01] its better not to have any children instead of having children like you
[15:09] she is putting false allegation
[15:11] she is lying
[15:13] I haven't done anything
[15:15] she has killed her baby, because she doesn't wanted to stay here. She wanted to go to her mom's place
[15:21] Mahi.. what are you doing? For God sake, stop it!
[15:26] Mirha, take Zara to her room
[15:34] Ahmed, I will talk to Mahi
[15:38] I will explain her, please control your anger
[15:41] I will explain her
[15:42] Explain this girl! She has gone insane
[15:47] next time if she goes close to Zara then no body will be as bad as me
[16:19] please sit
[16:25] let me bring water for you
[16:32] drink water
[16:34] sister, please drink some water
[16:52] show some patience, please
[17:40] Mahi, what do you want?
[17:42] mom, leave me along. Please go away from here
[17:44] have you gone mad?
Yes, I have
[17:47] dad ousted me from this house because of that Zara!
[17:50] so you are also after Zara, why don't you leave her alone?
[17:55] I don't want to listen to anything right now. I will do something wrong. Go away!
[17:59] for God sake Mahi, stop it!
[18:03] stop it now!
[18:06] you won't get anything with hatred
[18:09] look at me, what did I get? My son left this world
[18:14] stop it! Please don't anymore injustices with her. Apologize to her
[18:21] look at this, I fold my hands in front of you
[18:26] your father is so furious, please don't do any such thing
[18:29] now I cannot compete him for you, I don't have anymore courage at all
[18:37] is this what you're saying?
[18:40] you are saying this?
[18:43] will you leave supporting me for Zara?
[18:45] yes!
[18:48] I am saying this
[18:49] I am saying it
[18:51] now if you ever did any injustice with Zara
[18:57] then I won't support you
[18:59] Enough is enough!
[19:46] Mr. Ahmed
[19:50] Ahmed, are you fine?
[19:54] I couldn't even think that Mahi can do such a thing with Zara
[20:02] and you... 
[20:05] you have put a veil on your daughter's sin once again
[20:10] why Fareeda, why?
[20:15] I was afraid, Ahmed
[20:19] I thought, if you'll get to know this matter then
[20:23] your behavior will be like this, that's why I had to hide it
[20:28] you've ignored Zara's such a big pain for the sake of your fear & to save your daughter
[20:36] what kind of a mother you are?
[20:39] being a mother yourself, you couldn't realize the pain of another mother
[20:46] didn't you even think that how much injustice & oppression is done with the child?
[20:52] how much injustice is happening?
[20:55] you can be so selfish, I can never think of it
[21:04] and Mahi... 
[21:07] Mahi has snatched away the support of my elderly age as well
[21:16] don't know what not I had thought
[21:19] the happiness I couldn't give to my Adeel, I will shower them on his baby
[21:26] I will keep his child close to my heart
[21:33] Mahi had snatched that from me as well
[21:37] how will I face my son on the day of judgment?
[21:43] when he will ask me, "dad, did you took care of Zara after my demise"
what answer will I give him?
[22:01] she has snatched my right to stay alive
[22:08] I don't have any right to live now
[22:14] it is better for me to die
[22:19] what are you saying, Mr. Ahmed?
Please don't say this
[22:25] what will happen to me if something happens to you?
[22:30] I've already lost my son
[22:36] I don't want to loose you now. For God sake please don't say such things
[22:44] I won't let Zara live here anymore
[22:49] I will send her back
[22:52] I don't have any right on her
[22:57] neither I could become a good father for her... 
[23:01] nor I could fulfill the right of being her uncle
[23:11] if I cannot give protection to that girl in my house, then I have no right to keep her here
[23:18] no right at all!
[23:29] please delete it
[23:33] you have proved to be so weak, I mean really feeble
[23:37] you cannot insult me like this
[23:39] so what shall I do?
[23:40] what shall I do with you, tell me
[23:42] I am ready to do whatever you will say
[23:45] this is something sensible now
[23:58] where is everyone?
[24:01] can't you see, nobody is here
[24:03] nobody did the breakfast because of you
[24:06] haven't you started arguing a lot? I will pull out your tongue
[24:09] how many people mouth you'll shut?
[24:11] there is no need to talk rubbish with me. Maybe you have forgotten what had happened with you previously
[24:16] I haven't forgotten, but I am not selfish like you are
[24:22] you have forgotten. Are you feeling pity on Zara now?
[24:25] sister, you shouldn't have done whatever you did
[24:29] there is no need to teach me anything. Where are you going? Sit & have breakfast
[24:33] I am not hungry, you carry on
[24:57] have breakfast
[25:02] at least have breakfast, why are you upset with breakfast?
[25:07] if you won't eat anything then how will you take your medicine?
[25:10] also your blood pressure is up since last night
[25:17] at least talk to me
[25:20] I know you are upset with me
[25:26] but please understand my compulsion too
[25:29] I am Mahi's mother as well
[25:34] that's why you have always differentiated between Zara & Mahi
[25:38] and you kept lying to me continuously
[25:40] I made a mistake, please stop it now & forgive me
[25:46] and believe me, I tried explaining Mahi a lot
[25:53] I don't want to listen to anything, Fareeda!
[25:55] go away from here
[25:57] why are you punishing me?
[26:01] I am also upset, where shall I go?
[26:04] to whom shall I talk? With whom I shall share my grievances?
[26:08] have you seen Zara's condition?
[26:13] I will apologize to Zara. I swear, I will apologize to her
[26:19] with whom you'll apologize & for what more you'll apologize?
[26:25] its you who had poisoned Mahi's thinking
[26:30] you've given all this to her in inheritance
[26:34] and have you seen its consequences now?
[26:36] how would I know that Mahi will become like this?
[26:40] its parents duty to do their children upbringing
[26:44] to put love in their heart for the people
[26:49] to show them the right path
[26:52] to teach them to look at the society in such a manner that they shall go towards light instead of darkness
[27:00] you & your upbringing is responsible for whatever Mahi did
[27:08] it would be better for you to find a suitable proposal for Mahi & wed her off from this house as soon as possible
[27:15] what? what is this Mr. Ahmed?
Enough!
[27:19] I have announced my decision
[27:24] but at least listen to me please...
[27:29] Mr. Ahmed...
[27:37] tomorrow is my life's biggest event, Zara
[27:40] and you won't be present
[27:43] my prayers are with both of you
[27:51] what happened Zara, are you crying? Is everything fine?
[27:57] everything is fine
[27:59] these are tears of joy, I am so happy for both of you
[28:05] mom thought that you'll come
[28:08] but you don't sound fine
[28:11] don't worry about me, I will come to meet you guys once I will be fine
[28:16] why to meet only? We won't let you go back once you'll come now
[28:21] now you'll stay with us, over here
[28:23] do you know, how restless & anxious mom stays while worrying about you
[28:28] if you'll stay here in front of her eyes then she won't be tensed
[28:32] she stays quite worried
[28:34] and until when you'll tolerate all this?
[28:38] we know everything that you are not fine over there
[28:41] I want to come back now
[28:44] my tolerance level is ending now
[28:49] I don't have a courage to give anymore trials
[28:52] I have grown tired of fighting with my life
[28:58] Zara, don't say such disappointed things. One day everything will be fine
[29:04] Okay, I will come with mom to pick you.
[29:13] aunt, you?
[29:18] I will talk to you later
[29:21] Okay fine, take care. Bye!
[29:24] Bye!
[29:29] you are awake, I thought you must be sleeping. I came to wake you up, but you were talking on the phone
[29:38] Come on, get up. Eat something
[29:42] I am not hungry right now
[29:43] but you have to eat
[29:45] look at your condition, this way your weakness will increase
[29:50] food is more important, you can talk on the phone later
[29:55] I will eat something in a while
[30:38] hey hey, what are you doing?
You could have burn yourself
[30:43] does it make any difference to you whether anyone lives or dies?
[30:46] your anger hasn't lessened as of yet, right?
I'm sure Zara must have said something about me
[30:50] Zara didn't said anything, in fact nobody had said anything
[30:54] now stop thinking that whomsoever is saying or doing what!
[30:59] until when you'll keep scolding me?
[31:01] as if it affects you?
[31:05] your father has decided to marry you, & wed you off with respect from this house
[31:10] I don't want to get married at all, mom
[31:12] its your father's decision, got it?
[31:15] and be thankful that he is talking about wedding you off
[31:19] Whatever you've done, if he had ousted you from this house then what you could have done. Just think!
[31:25] you guys are doing all this with me because of that Zara, right?
[31:28] you are present in this house because of Zara
[31:32] otherwise, we would have ousted you from this house long time ago
[31:34] what's wrong with you? Why are you always favoring her?
[31:39] you've destroyed yourself by your own actions/words, Mahi
[31:43] nobody is at fault or mistake in this
[31:47] you are my mother... you always used to take my side, mom
[31:51] and your father is taunting me about the same thing
[31:55] my upbringing is being questioned because of you
[31:59] for God sake, stop it
[32:01] stop it, I cannot tolerate it anymore
[32:04] I've grown tired!
mom..
[32:06] mom!
[32:26] you haven't done good, Zara
[32:29] today, my family has left me all alone because of you
[32:34] my mother has left supporting me
[32:37] and dad..
[32:39] dad was ousting me from this house, only because of you
[32:46] I will never forgive you for this
[32:50] now I will also get you ousted from the house like this
[32:53] and you'll see
[32:55] at that time, nobody will be there to save you
[33:02] you haven't done good with me
[33:05] its revenge is still left, Zara
[33:13] I have to do something quickly and I..
[33:15] and I...

[34:07] a lot had happened in the house & you are still involved with him
[34:10] sister, what is your problem? Why don't you let us live in peace?
[34:14] I don't let you stay in peace, right? let me go & tell mom everything

[34:18] what happened? you got afraid?
You are swerving like a fish due to mom's fear

[36:17] hmm... As per the rule, it should have been with the police but I have it
[36:22] this...

[36:29] I have a lot of copies of it
[36:32] what do you want from me?
[36:34] riddance

[37:09] see, please don't do this
[37:12] whatever you'll say, I am ready to do
[37:17] now you came on the point
[37:22] I have another important work with you
[37:27] what's that?
[37:42] aunty, tell me something as well so that I can help you
[37:46] No dear, leave it. Your clothes will be spoiled
[37:49] No no aunty, its not like that. My clothes won't be spoiled. Please let me know how can I help you
[37:56] my son is very lucky, right?
[38:01] just take this breakfast for him
[38:03] otherwise, he will leave without eating it
[38:06] Okay, by the way aunty what does he like to have in the breakfast?
[38:11] he quietly eats whatever is given to him, he doesn't show any tantrums
[38:16] if you'll feed him the food cooked with love
[38:20] then he'll have it happily
[38:23] my son doesn't show any tantrums
[38:25] yes, you can guide me & I will make it
[38:28] here you go, take it
[38:32] thank you!
[38:44] did you went to meet Aqib yesterday? What did you guys discussed?
[38:48] what will you do after listening to it?
[38:50] at least I should know the reason that why you wanted to meet him
[38:53] I felt like meeting him, that's why I had gone to meet him
[38:55] by the way, you choice is good
[38:58] are you joking?
[39:00] why are you thinking that I will make fun of him?
[39:03] do you think about him in that way?
[39:05] I mean, I found him appropriate & well
[39:09] why are you changing the topic?
Why will I change the topic?
[39:12] I had to meet him, so I met him. That's it!
[39:14] I am asking this from you, that what needs to be done next?
[39:17] what do you mean?
[39:18] I want you to talk to our parents about us. Aqib & I like each other and...
[39:24] ok enough!
