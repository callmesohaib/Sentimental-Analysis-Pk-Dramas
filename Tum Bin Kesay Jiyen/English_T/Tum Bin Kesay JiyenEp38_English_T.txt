[00:12] you can understand the meaning of delaying the marriage very well
[00:17] people will make various gossips about Dolly
[00:19] already there are rumors that why we've kept the wedding all of a sudden
[00:25] and now when we'll postpone it, then the matter will be exaggerated for no reason
[00:30] you have gone to far in your revenge, that you've murdered Zara's baby
[00:34] and you don't realize it at all
[00:37] Mahi!
[00:39] what have you done?
[00:41] Ahmed! 
you've ruined Zara's life
[00:45] please delete it
[00:48] you have proved to be so weak, I mean really feeble
[00:52] you cannot insult me like this
[00:54] so what shall I do?
what shall I do with you, tell me
[00:57] I am ready to do whatever you will say
[01:00] this is something sensible now
[01:25] when did you come?
[01:26] I just came a while ago
[01:32] actually aunt had sent breakfast for you
[01:35] I see, it means you've come to impress my mom

[02:43] please rest...
mom, what happened to you? Just now you were fine
[02:48] don't know dear, I got dizzy all of a sudden & now I am feeling too much of weakness
[02:55] sister, its not a good sign to get dizzy all of a sudden & to feel weakness
[03:03] if you won't eat or drink anything, and work all day long then its evident for you to get dizzy
[03:11] your daughter-in-law is about to come into your house. So now you'll only rest, you won't work anymore 
[03:21] did you call Zara?
[03:26] did you ask, how is she?
[03:28] mom, she is fine. I had a word with her in the morning. What happened?
[03:33] I don't know I was feeling anxious all of a sudden

[03:40] sister, drink juice. God will make things better
[03:44] mom, please get up. Be careful
[03:46] don't know what worries are eating her from within

[07:23] you go, I am coming
[07:24] to whom you are calling?
[07:25] I'm calling Zara, she isn't attending the phone
[07:28] maybe she doesn't want to talk to you right now
[07:31] and Saad please, leave her alone for a few days
[07:35] She will call you back once she settles down
[07:39] yes but I am going to pick her
[07:43] have you gone mad?
[07:47] how can she come right now?
[07:49] what do you mean by that? 
I will bring her
[07:51] I have done all the arrangements too. I will go & bring her safely
[07:55] Saad, please leave this childish act & why are you insisting in bringing her over?
[07:59] as it is, she will come here within a few days
[08:02] Right now, everyone needs you over here
[08:05] Saad, its your sister's wedding. Do you even care about it?
[08:08] I do care & I will manage it
[08:11] why are you doing this foolishness?
[08:14] you know the guests will be here in a while. If you'll go at this hour then at what time you'll come back?
[08:19] I will come back in a while, and Zara's presence is important here
[08:23] its her brother's wedding as well
[08:26] Saad, Zara is my sister
[08:29] and I am also concerned for her as much as you are
[08:32] even I am not liking it that she is not here at this hour
[08:36] but I cannot put her life in anymore trouble by bringing her over here in contumacy
[08:42] And I thought of taking her on the video call at the time of nuptial vows
[08:47] please don't worry
[08:50] and stop dialing your phone again & again
[08:53] Dolly has been waiting for you since so long. Come!
[08:57] and Saad, you are doing injustice with the rest of the relations because of your friendship

[17:59] uncle, don't know how he entered my room. I don't know who he is & how he entered my room. I don't know
[18:07] Zara, what's wrong? You have sent me a message yourself
[18:09] and now you are acting strange in front of them
[18:14] he is lying, and why will I message you? Uncle, there isn't any such thing. I hardly know him
[18:21] what do you mean by why?
[18:24] we both love each other, and you've called me yourself so that we can meet in private
[18:28] stop your rubbish! Who are you & how did you enter my house?
[18:33] uncle, relax. Somebody will hear us
[18:36] well... what difference does it make if anyone hear us now
[18:40] Zara & I like each other & we want to get married
[18:43] that's why Zara had called me here in private, so that we can elope from this house today
[18:48] uncle, he is lying. There isn't any such thing, I don't know him at all
[18:54] what is all this, Zara?
[18:56] who is this boy, what is he doing in your room? Tell me the truth
[19:00] aunty, I swear I don't know who he is & how he entered my room. I really don't know
[19:05] uncle, I don't know who he is
[19:08] Zara, don't lie at least. Tell the truth to everyone
[19:12] I am with you, you don't need to be afraid of anyone
[19:15] why are you lying? Why are you doing this to me?
Uncle, ask him. I don't know who he is
[19:27] Aqib!
[19:37] Mirha, be quiet
[19:40] but he is Aqib
[19:43] I know
[19:44] what is he doing here?
[19:46] in sister Zara's room?
Let me go
[19:49] you won't go anywhere, nor you'll say anything to anyone. You don't know him
[19:53] sister... 
[19:54] no ifs or buts, listen to me with open ears
[19:57] you won't tell anything to anyone, else nobody will be as bad as me Mirha. I am telling you
[20:01] sister, please...
you will stay completely quiet
[20:04] you won't say anything to anyone, Mirha. Else I will thrash you so hard that you'll remember for lifetime
[20:09] but sister, this.. 
[20:10] be quiet, I cannot tell you anything right now. Please go from here
[20:13] move away!
go!
[20:20] I had brought you as my daughter-in-law, for the sake of my son Adeel's desire. Although I never wanted to
[20:28] you'll proved to be of such character
[20:31] I had never imagined that you'll proved to be of such a character
[20:35] you've forgotten Adeel so soon, you didn't even realize that you just became a widow
[20:46] what is all this?
[20:48] uncle, relax. Let me tell you everything, ok?
[20:51] you are the same guy who was standing outside yesterday, right?
[20:55] move away! Dad, he was outside our house yesterday as well. I saw him myself
[21:00] and when I asked him that what is he doing here, then he started making excuses
[21:04] he said, I am searching for an address
[21:05] now I got to know that he used to come here for Zara
[21:09] Mahi! Why are you doing all this with me?
[21:14] why am I doing?
[21:15] who is he? We don't know him
[21:18] when we don't know him, then what is he doing in this house?
[21:21]  Not only in this house, but what is he doing in your room?
[21:24] Zara, speak up! How come this boy came to your room. What is he doing in your room?
[21:31] Zara, what's wrong with you? Tell them the truth, why are you hiding it?
[21:36] uncle, aunty... I am Faraz. We became friends on Facebook
[21:42] and don't know when this friendship turned into love. Zara doesn't have any fault in it
[21:47] I had expressed my love for her for the first time
[21:49] initially she was hiding her feelings a lot
[21:52] then finally she admitted that she also loves me
[21:55] but she had some compulsions due to which she was hiding our relation from you guys
[21:59] and now when everything came in front of you, then why the delay?
[22:06] I don't understand..
[22:08] Zara, what rubbish this guy is uttering?
[22:12] aunty, please don't say anything to Zara. Instead, you can talk to me & say whatever you want to
[22:16] if you don't believe me then you can check my phone or Zara's phone
[22:21] I think, she has saved my number by Saad's name so that you guys shouldn't doubt
[22:27] but now everything is in front of you, then why the delay?
[22:53] Oh God!
[22:55] oh God, what is this happening?
[22:57] I don't get it
[22:59] Mr. Ahmed, I think this guy is telling the truth
[23:05] I saw a few calls of a guy namely "Saad" on Zara's phone
[23:11] I saw it myself, with my own eyes. This guy is telling the truth
[23:14] aunty!
[23:15] no matter if you've seen it or not, but I don't believe on this matter at all!
[23:19] my Zara is not like that
[23:23] uncle, if you don't believe me then let me call Zara
[23:28] you will believe me then
[23:30] yes, call me right away
[23:33] uncle, he is just putting false allegation on me. When I don't know him then how come he will have my number?
[23:38] tell him to call me
[23:39] yes! call Zara's number right away
[25:14] did you all believe me now?
[25:40] Zara!
[25:42] Zara, you'll proved to be of such character. I had never thought of it
[25:48] what is all this, Zara?
[25:53] I had brought you as my daughter-in-law, for the sake of my son Adeel's desire. Although I never wanted to
[26:02] you'll proved to be of such character
[26:06] I had never imagined that you'll proved to be of such a character
[26:10] you've forgotten Adeel so soon, you didn't even realize that you just became a widow
[26:17] aunty, don't you worry at all. I will take very good care of Zara
[26:20] Don't you dare to utter a single word from your mouth
[26:24] I will kill you!
[26:28] if you took Zara's name from your filthy tongue, then nobody will be as bad as me
[26:35] my Zara is not like that at all
[26:39] beat me, come on. I am standing in front of you
[26:42] but I truly love Zara
[26:45] Zara is mine, only mine..
[26:47] lets go Zara!
don't you dare!
[26:55] get out of here, Get lost!
[26:58] and if you'll look back, then I will ask the police to be after you. Get out of here!
[27:04] uncle, you are not doing the right thing
[27:05] I said, get lost from here. Go away. Come on!
[27:08] get out of here!
[27:23] is there any spectacle left to be seen?
[27:26] that you are sitting here
[27:29] your daughter-in-law has tarnished your honor
[27:33] I used to say to you, but you never listen to me. Lets go now!
[28:32] uncle...
[28:34] please believe me, I haven't done any such thing
[28:37] its all a lie
[28:40] you know, I cannot do this right? You know me well, right uncle?
[28:46] I know you, dear
[28:48] I know whatever happened cannot be true
[28:54] Ahmed, what are you saying?
[28:58] are you believing on this girl's words?
[29:00] Fareeda!
enough!
[29:03] I won't hear anything at all
[29:05] is this why you've stopped her?
[29:08] to get ourselves humiliated or insulted?
[29:11] how can you believe on some stranger guy?
[29:16] really? So he was a stranger for us but not for her?
[29:22] don't know to how many people she has told our address
[29:27] what are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[29:30] I am absolutely in my senses
[29:32] it would have been good, if we would have sent her back to her parents house
[29:36] I told you so many times to drop her back to her house
[29:42] but you didn't agree with me
[29:45] I had told you that we cannot take such a big responsibility on ourselves
[29:52] are you happy now? Did you see?
[29:55] are you satisfied now after getting humiliated due to your niece?
[30:01] my God knows I am innocent, I haven't done anything
[30:06] please believe me
[30:08] enough!
[30:10] don't you dare to utter a single word from your mouth
[30:14] we have caught you red-handed. You were inside a room with some stranger guy
[30:21] if we hadn't seen you with our own eyes, then we would have never got to know that with whomsoever you are being involved with
[30:30] Mahi was right
[30:33] she was right that you never wanted Adeel's baby to come into this world
[30:40] if you didn't wanted Adeel's baby, then you could have given that baby to me
[30:44] I would have taken care of that baby. We would have left you alone to enjoy the freedom
[30:50] aunty, what are you saying? Have some sense please
[30:54] I can never think of it. I only have Adeel in my heart, what are you talking about?
[31:00] don't you dare to take Adeel's name from your filthy tongue
[31:07] you've made a spectacle of his love
[31:11] what was missing in his love for you?
[31:15] what amiss we gave you?
[31:18] why you became unfaithful to my son?
[31:21] aunty, I haven't done anything. There isn't any such thing that you are thinking of
[31:25] don't you know what I am saying?
[31:27] please believe me
huh!
[31:31] uncle!
move away Zara, move away!
[31:34] we don't need you
[31:41] Mahi, take your father to his room
[31:45] Ok
[31:46] move away
[31:51] please come
[31:54] only this day was left to be seen
[35:20] where is Zara?
[35:22] Zara must be somewhere
[35:24] Call her, I want to speak to her
[35:28] what's wrong with you, Mr. Ahmed?
[35:31] you are not well, for God sake do some rest. Yet you are worried about Zara
[35:36] dad, you are still concerned for Zara? 
She didn't even come once to ask about your health
[35:41] why will she come in front of us?
[35:43] since she got exposed in front of all. She won't come now
[35:48] No
[35:50] I don't agree that Zara did any such thing
[35:56] No
[35:58] this is the truth Mr. Ahmed, accept it
[36:04] and you must be habitual of ignoring things
[36:07] I am not habitual of it at all
[36:10] I'm telling you clearly, today on wards I won't tolerate that Zara in this house
[36:17] The decision has been made!
[36:20] did you gave him the medicine?
[36:23] yes
[36:24] would you like to drink water?
[36:26] No
[36:27] I don't want to drink
[36:38] No...
[38:18] Zaini, dear why are you standing here alone?
Come, lets take a picture together
[38:23] come on, lets go!
[38:25] come my dear
[38:41] take this
[38:44] what shall I do with it?
[38:45] hey, call aunt & tell her to take away her daughter immediately from here
[38:51] but Mahi, they must be busy in the wedding over there
[38:53] so what shall we do?
[38:55] whatever we are going through because of her daughter, is that something less?
[38:59] and this is great!
[39:01] they shall enjoy the celebrations, and we shall tolerate the pain over here because of their daughter!
[39:06] Call her right away. Call her & ask her to take away her daughter with her
[39:12] by the way, this girl has deceived us big time
[39:16] she made a fool out of us
[39:19] I had kept her in such a precious manner, and she has proved to be of this character
[39:23] she was always the same
[39:26] the same way, she had made Adeel a fool as well
[39:31] she has deceived my innocent son such a big time
[39:37] I will never see her face ever
[39:39] not only her, I won't see her mother's face too
[39:43] no matter how much she begs me or apologize to me
[39:47] also I won't let Ahmed keep any relation with them, you'll see
[39:53] do one thing...
[39:55] call Sarwat yourself
[39:57] and tell her to come & take away her wretched daughter from here
[40:01] I don't want to hear her voice even
[40:04] ok fine, please go to dad. Meanwhile, let me call her
[40:09] Okay
