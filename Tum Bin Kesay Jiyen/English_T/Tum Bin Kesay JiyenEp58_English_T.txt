[00:12] Why have you come here? 
You are following me, right?
[00:16] Mirha, I want to discuss something very important with you.
[00:18] I don't want to listen to you.
[00:20] If you come even one step further then I will make noise.
[00:23] You beat me and Zara also tried to beat me.
[00:29] And look what did I do.
[00:31] Your engagement was broken.
[00:34] And Zara's connection to this house also broke.
[00:37] It is called
[00:39] killing two birds with one stone
[00:42] I took my revenge.
[00:44] Listen to me.
Leave me.
[01:02] Your tea.
give me
[01:04] Where is sister Sarwat?
[01:09] Maheen has taken her to her room.
[01:11] She is not feeling well.
[01:13] Oh I see.
[01:15] Let me meet her.
[01:17] I think we should leave now, it's been very late.
[01:21] Go and tell Saad that we should go home. It's very late.
[01:28] Take tea, I will ask Saad.
OK.
[03:19] Dad.
Yes my child.
[03:21] University is giving us an opportunity to go abroad for studies on scholarship.
[03:26] And I want to apply for this scholarship.
[03:30] Are you in your senses?
[03:33] We have only given you permission to go to university but now you want to take undue advantage of this.
[03:39] What's wrong with you Fareeda? I am talking to her.
[03:45] My child tell me that you will go there but how will you be able to manage your expenses there?
[03:51] Dad university will sponsor so many students for that.
[03:55] They will manage accommodation and food expenses by themselves.
[03:59] Dad
[04:01] Brother Adeel used to say that we get golden chances in our life only once.
[04:07] And we should grab those whenever we get them.
[04:12] Dad I don't want to live here, I want to go abroad for studies.
[04:17] It's enough.
[04:18] We have listened your opinion.
[04:20] Why are you quiet now?
[04:22] Ask your daughter that what happened to her that she doesn't want to live here.
[04:28] Why does she want to go abroad by leaving her parents.
[04:32] Fareeda
[04:34] What happened to you?
[04:36] Why do you become so suspicious so quickly about your daughters?
[04:43] Dad there is no reason behind this.
[04:46] I just want to go abroad for studies.
[04:54] Everything has changed here after brother Adeel's demise.
[05:01] I miss him so much.
[05:04] And
[05:05] And I can't focus on my studies because of that.
[05:12] So it means
[05:15] You want to get escape from here.
[05:21] My child, me and your mother are also living here in the same circumstances.
[05:29] And we don't have anyone except you and Mahi.
[05:33] But dad I will also make arrangements for your settlement there.
[05:37] All of us can get out of here.
[05:41] Madam
[05:42] Going abroad is not a joke, do you understand?
[05:47] Go to your university quietly otherwise I will forbid you to go there.
[05:53] Huh, she wants to go abroad.
[05:55] I won't go anywhere.
[05:58] My son has died in this house.
[06:00] My dead body will also go for funeral from this house.
[06:04] Rather, no one will go anywhere.
[06:07] This is my final decision. Do you understand?
[06:13] Dad
[06:18] Listen
[06:19] Let's think about it.
[06:52] I made a mistake to identify your real face Fahad.
[06:56] What I had thought about you but you turned out to be completely opposite.
[07:01] Mirha was right.
[07:03] You are not a good person but I didn't listen to my own sister.
[07:09] I trusted you.
[07:12] You not only broke my trust but also caused damaged to my whole body.
[07:20] The mistake I made by trusting you, I won't make that same mistake again.
[07:29] I will never forgive you.
[07:32] And I will never see your face again.
[07:36] I hate you.
[07:38] Hate.
[07:41] Please eat something. Why aren't you eating?
[07:45] Why are you doing this to yourself?
He hasn't eaten yet?
[07:49] No mom.
[07:52] Why Adnan?
[07:54] I can't eat sister.
[07:58] The person who always cooked food for me and with her I always used to eat.
[08:06] She has left me so how can I eat.
[08:12] We were eating food.
[08:17] I don't know why did she went downstairs and all of that happened.
[08:22] I wish I wouldn't have let her go downstairs then all of that wouldn't happen.
[08:32] You will have to be patient Adnan.
[08:37] You will have to take care of yourself.
How can I do that?
[08:43] The person who used to take care of me has left.
[08:47] Now how can I compose myself and how can I live?
[08:53] I am thankful to you and brother that you allowed me to live in your house for such a long time.
[09:02] But I was living in this house only because of Shaista because she was your relative.
[09:08] After her demise, I have no relation with this house.
[09:13] What are you talking about?
[09:14] You are not alone. We are with you. We are your family.
[09:19] The person who was related to you has left so how can I live here. 
[09:25] I should leave this house.
[09:28] Rather, I should leave right now.
[09:30] Uncle Adnan, what are you talking about?
This is not possible. Sit down.
[09:33] Please sit, we will discuss.
[09:37] Please sit.
Sit down Adnan.
[09:45] What are you doing Adnan? Have some courage.
[09:50] Maybe she was destined to live that much.
[09:55] She was not only dear to you, she was also dear to us.
[09:58] You are not alone in this pain, all of us are with you in this difficult time.
[10:06] We are showing courage.
[10:10] You will have to do the same.
[10:12] Sister, I am unable to understand that how do I compose myself
[10:20] I am unable to understand anything.
[10:23] You are not alone.
[10:25] We are with you.
[10:28] Who dares to ask you to leave this house.
[10:32] You are like a younger brother to me.
[10:35] I warn you Adnan if you again talked about leaving this house.
[10:39] Promise me that you won't say this again.
[10:47] OK sister, as you wish.
[11:02] Give him something to eat.
[12:52] What was Zenny saying?
[12:54] I forgot, she asked me to bring something for her.
[12:58] But you didn't buy anything for her.
[13:01] I asked her but she didn't tell me.
[13:03] So what do I buy for her?
[13:05] If she won't tell you anything then won't you buy anything for her?
[13:08] But what's the problem in telling me?
[13:10] You also tell me when you need anything.
[14:24] All my paths go towards you Zenny. 
[14:27] You are my destination.
[14:33] My life is enlightened only because of your smile.
[14:42] Never reduce your love for me.
[15:58] Saad.
Yes.
[16:01] I want to talk to you.
Go ahead.
[16:05] Leave me.
[16:10] Marry Zenny.
[16:15] What are you talking about? Are you in your senses?
[16:19] I am right Saad.
[16:22] I have heard everything.
[16:25] I know that you love Zenny.
[16:28] And Zenny also love you.
[16:31] You and Zenny are made for each other.
[16:37] Whatever has happened is only because of me.
[16:45] Leave me.
[16:50] I can't bear all of this.
[16:53] When I see you with Zenny then do you have any idea that how sad I feel that all of this has happened because of me 
[16:58] and both of you have been separated because of me.
[17:00] Zara, there is nothing like that.
[17:06] What are you thinking?
[17:07] So now you will lie in front of me Saad.
[17:12] Tell me the truth.
[17:15] Don't you love Zenny?
Zara, Zenny was my past.
[17:19] And you are my present.
[17:20] And you know that I can't even think about any other girl except you.
[17:24] I am in relationship..
It's OK Saad
[17:28] OK
[17:30] Let me leave you. 
[17:33] I will file separation case.
[17:35] Then there will be no problem and everything will be fixed.
[17:38] Zara, what happened to you.
[17:42] What happened?
[17:44] Saad
[17:46] You and Zenny have been separated because of me
[17:50] Now I will make your reunion as well.
[18:01] Are both you sisters are mad? Hmm?
[18:05] Sometime one sister asks me leave her and other day other sister asks me to leave her.
[18:09] What do you want?
Saad
[18:11] It's enough.
[18:27] It's Dolly's call.
[18:34] What's up Dolly.
[18:36] What?
[18:38] What happened to dad?
[18:41] I am coming. Yes I am coming.
[18:44] What happened?
Saad, dad is not feeling well. Let's go.
[18:51] OK. I told her.
[18:56] What are you doing here?
I was calling.
[19:00] To whom?
[19:01] I was informing Zara.
To Zara.
[19:08] Why have you called Zara? You know that dad is not feeling well.
[19:13] How can you make such a fooling act Dolly?
[19:16] Brother, don't say anything to Dolly.
[19:20] I asked her to call Zara.
You insisted her.
[19:26] Brother actually
[19:34] Dad's condition is not good.
[19:38] He is calling Zara's name all night long.
[19:43] I can't see him in this condition.
[19:47] And tell me brother that how can I stop her by coming to this house.
[19:52] This house also belongs to her.
[19:54] Zenny you have complete right to stop her.
[19:57] But this is not right to separate a daughter from her father.
[20:02] Zenny you are forgetting that what both of them have done to you.
[20:05] I remember everything brother.
[20:09] But what is the fault of dad in this.
[20:20] Zenny I will be proud on your thoughts.
[20:24] You have grown up and become so sensible, I didn't even realize.
[20:31] Let's go to dad.
[20:35] OK, you go, I am coming.
[20:58] The lady you are asking about, her name was Jamila.
Yes, Jamila.
[21:03] She has disappeared from here.
[21:06] So many people are asking about her since last few days.
[21:08] I think she has done some fraud.
[22:04] Mahi how are you? I am very concerned for you.
[22:08] Can we talk?
[22:10] I am thinking about you again and again.
[22:13] Please discuss with me about any problem.
[22:36] For God sake, don't call me and send me messages again and again.
[22:39] I don't want to talk to you. Please leave me alone.
[22:53] For God sake, don't call me and send me messages again and again.
[22:57] I don't want to talk to you. Please leave me alone.
[23:10] Hi Mr. Hamdani, I want to discuss something important with you.
[23:25] Give me one paratha.
[23:31] Thank you.
[23:45] What's the matter my child? Why aren't you eating breakfast?
[23:53] If you don't want to eat anything then just drink juice.
[25:22] Mirha
[25:28] Mahi
[25:30] What happened? Why are sitting so quietly?
[25:34] Nothing.
[25:36] Something is there.
[25:39] I am observing you.
[25:42] You are in some sort of thoughts these days. Hmm?
[25:46] You neither eat nor drink anything and don't talk to anyone.
[25:50] Nothing mom, I don't want to talk to anyone.
[25:55] But why?
[25:58] Look, I am your mother.
[26:00] You can hide nothing from me.
[26:03] And I feel that you are hiding something really big from me.
[26:07] Nothing mom, if there was anything then I would have told you first.
[26:11] OK, if there is nothing like that then go and get fresh.
[26:16] I don't want to see this sad face of yours, you are looking bad in this mood.
[26:20] OK, I will do that.
[26:22] Well, do you know about Mirha's request.
[26:26] I think I should stop her from going to university.
[26:30] Why?
[26:31] Oh so you don't know anything.
[26:35] She is thinking about going abroad.
[26:39] She was requesting his dad that she wants to go abroad for studies.
[26:43] Is this the right thing?
[26:46] Has any girl gone abroad in our family till date.
[26:50] I have decided that if she again discussed this topic
[26:55] Then don't call me as Fareeda if won't break her legs.
[26:59] Let her go mom, what's the problem?
[27:02] Don't stop her.
What?
[27:05] You are saying this?
[27:08] What are you talking about? How can I let her go?
[27:12] She is talking about going abroad.
[27:14] And you are asking me to let her go. What happened to you?
[27:18] I don't want Mirha to become another Mahi.
[27:21] What?
[27:23] What happened to you?
[27:26] What's wrong with you? Why are you saying this?
[27:31] What do I have mom? I haven't do anything till date.
[27:36] I didn't get anything except spreading hate and getting hate from others.
[27:41] Let her go.
[27:43] Do you know that I don't have any strength to face any defeat.
[27:47] Mahi what happened, tell me.
[27:52] Why are you thinking such bad things about yourself.
[27:55] You used to praise yourself.
[27:59] But you are behaving oppositely. Tell me, what happened?
[28:05] My heart will sink Mahi.
[28:08] I don't know what are you talking about.
[28:12] What's the matter?
[28:15] This incident has made me realized
[28:19] That I always chose wrong path in my foolishness.
[28:23] But I didn't get anything in reward.
[28:27] Except humiliation and insult.
[28:30] I am asking about that, why aren't you telling me that what happened?
[28:35] Nothing has happened to me.
[28:38] But I have realized that I always chose wrong path in my foolishness.
[28:47] But Mirha is choosing the right path.
[28:50] She knows that what does she want from her life and dad has no objection with her so let her go.
[28:55] Don't stop her.
[28:58] She will become confident when she will go abroad.
[29:04] She won't become a coward like me.
No.
[29:07] My daughter is not a coward.
[29:11] I don't know what happened to you.
[29:13] Why are you saying such bad things about yourself.
[29:17] You used to praise yourself but now you are saying such things.
[29:22]  At least tell me what happened.
[29:24] Why are you saying such things?
[29:26] Because I was not sensible enough earlier.
[29:29] But now, I have understood.
[29:31] But today I have realized that we shouldn't be that much selfish and self-centered.
[29:36] OK stop.
[29:38] Don't give me any lecture. OK.
[29:41] I know what to do.
[29:44] It's my final decision now that Mirha won't go abroad.
[29:53] You have already lost your son because of your stubbornness.
[29:57] Don't do it again for your daughter.
[30:37] How are you feeling now dad?
[30:45] Please forgive me dad.
[30:49] If you feel that I am culprit then I accept your blame dad.
[30:58] Don't hate me dad.
[31:00] I can't live with your hate.
[31:04] You can give me whatever punishment you want.
[31:07] I will accept any of your punishment whole heartedly but please don't get angry with me.
[31:16] Please forgive me dad.
[31:19] I can't live without you.
[31:22] Please forgive me dad.
[31:26] Please forgive me dad.
[31:29] I will do what you will ask me to do.
[31:33] Please forgive me once.
[31:41] Get well dad.
[31:51] Please forgive me.
[32:21] Why is Jamila's phone inaccessible?
[32:25] It's been so long, she didn't talk to me.
[32:29] She knows that I am all alone after Shaista's demise.
[32:36] Maybe she is in some trouble.
[32:39] That's why she didn't call me.
[34:44] My son, my life.
[34:52] Do you also think that my stubbornness has taken your life?
[35:03] How can I do that?
[35:10] Why did Mahi say that?
[35:17] How can I do that?
[35:24] You know that
[35:26] You were my dearest child.
[35:32] You were my only son.
[35:36] You were my life.
[35:43] I am left alone without you Adeel.
[35:53] Why did you leave me alone Adeel?
[36:01] Why did you leave me?
[36:06] Your mother is left absolutely alone without you.
[36:14] Why did you leave me so early?
[36:21] You left your mother alone.
[36:28] Why?
[36:51] Mom, sorry.
[37:04] Sorry
[37:16] Have you raised any points?
[37:20] Write down your points and give me.
[37:22] Share that with me. Right. And...
[37:29] I will give you further information. Meeting is over.
[37:49] Miss Zenny, please stop.
[37:55] Are you OK?
Yes sir.
[37:59] So what were you thinking during meeting.
[38:03] Sir, actually...
Look miss Zenny, leave all your family issues at home.
[38:10] I want your hundred percent here. You can take few days leave if you want.
[38:15] And join back after resolving all your issues. Understand?
[38:21] Right sir.
You may leave now.
[38:41] What happened? What did he say?
He was scolding me.
[38:47] But why?
He was saying that what was I thinking during meeting?
[38:51] Whenever we do any good work then he doesn't appreciate but whenever we make a mistake, he immediately scolds us.
[38:58] I don't what does he think about himself. He is so weird and rude.
Did you say anything?
[39:07] You
[39:09] No sir.
Excuse me sir.
[39:14] Sir, I will be back.
[39:32] Brother.
Yes.
[39:34] Greetings.
Greetings.
[39:35] A lady used to live here.
For whom are you talking about?
[39:38] Are you new in this neighborhood? A lady used to live here.
[39:41] Brother talk to me in a gentle tone. I have been living in this neighborhood since last ten years.
[39:45] You have been living here since last ten years but you don't know that who is living in your neighborhood.
[39:49] Brother new tenants come in this house after every six months.
[39:52] But this family was living here for last one year.
[39:54] On rent?
[39:55] This house belongs to brother Umair Pasha, he has passed away long ago.
[39:59] His son has rent out this house. He lives abroad.
[40:02] That lady's name was Jamila.
Yes Jamila
[40:07] She has disappeared from here immediately.
[40:10] So many peoples are coming and asking about her. I think she has done some fraud.
[40:16] That everyone is chasing her and you are also asking about her.
[40:21] Thank you brother. Please leave.
