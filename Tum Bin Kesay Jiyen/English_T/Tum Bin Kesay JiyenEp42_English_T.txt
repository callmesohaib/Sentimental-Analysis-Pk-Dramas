[00:12] She has been continuously crying, missing Adeel
[00:15] since last night, she hasn't eaten anything. I took breakfast for her but she didn't even eat that.
[00:21] She's talking weirdly. I don't understand what to do.
[00:28] Zara, we don't offer clarifications to everyone.
[00:30] Then what should I do? What should I do? How can I clear the accusation to my name?
[00:35] How can I tell everyone that I'm not at fault.
[00:38] We don't make everyone believe us, Zara.
[00:41] How can someone be so untrustworthy so fast?
[00:46] They were my family.
[00:48] They weren't your family and they can never be.
[00:52] This is what we tried to explain you earlier as well.
[00:56] And even now you're repeating the same thing.
[00:58] If you still don't stand up for yourself, you'll get buried under this burden.
[01:17] I heard that your daughter has an affair with someone and her in laws threw her out.
[01:42] Sarwat...
[01:44] everybody knows and, Sarwat, such things don't stay hidden.
[01:49] I didn't believe my ears that's why I came to ask you.
[01:59] mom, please drink water
[02:02] mom, what was the need for you to listen to her rubbish?
[02:06] what else I could have done?
[02:08] if I had been in your place, then I would have pushed & ousted her out of here
[02:11] Really? So that she would have told the matter to everyone after exaggerating it
[02:17] mom, who gave her the right to say such things about us? Who is she?
[02:22] Maheen, for God sake please be quiet
[02:25] don't make me more crazy
[02:29] mom, I think aunt is doing all this
[02:34] she is calling everyone & telling weird stuff
[02:37] talk to aunt, ask her why is she doing all this
[02:40] Zaini is absolutely correct. You should talk to her
[02:45] who is she to call people & talk weird stuff about us?
[02:50] I don't understand, what is she getting by doing all this?
[02:55] our daughter is back home now, then why she is doing all this?
[02:58] She is doing all this to save herself
[03:01] so that nobody shall say this in the future, that how cruel mother-in-law she is
[03:06] that she threw away her daughter from her house, as soon as her son died
[03:09] she is doing all this to get herself saved
[03:12] its such a vile & disgusting act!
[03:15] We weren't saying anything to anyone though, then what was the need to spread such rumors?
[03:20] one doesn't even do this with their enemies, that she did with us
[03:26] here you go sister, I have brought the snacks
[03:30] what happen, where are the guests?
[03:33] actually, they have gone
[03:35] what happen, why are you people looking so worried?
Sister, tell me. Is everything alright?
[03:41] actually she was talking non-sense about Zara
[03:46] I have told mom that it can be only aunt's antics
[03:52] don't know why she is doing this. And the neighbors are talking non-sense about all of us
[04:00] let it be, forget it
[04:27] Adnan
[04:32] where have you gone without informing me?
[04:35] have I ever told you earlier before going anywhere, that I will tell you now?
[04:38] I've asked you a simple question, so please reply me simply
[04:41] the simple answer is that sister had asked me to bring snacks for her guests
[04:46] but when I had brought the snacks the situation was different. I got worried & stayed there
[04:51] why, what happen? Why you got worried?
[04:53] the lady who had visited her, came to do the gossips
[04:57] she had insulted sister so much, that don't ask
[05:01] and Zara! She has exposed Zara completely
[05:05] your brother & his daughter are not left to face anyone anymore
[05:09] what are you saying?
[05:12] who told her all this?
[05:14] Zara's mother-in-law, who else? The matter is exposed to the entire family
[05:18] now listen to me carefully, stay away from Zara's matter!
[05:23] what if this fire reaches to our house as well
[05:25] Adnan, for God sake don't utter all these words downstairs
[05:30] shut your mouth! its their matter, they will handle it
[05:33] the entire world is saying this, so what difference will it make if I will also say it?
[05:37] this spark will not get over so easily
[05:41] I am going downstairs
[05:42] what?
[05:43] go, go & gather the information
[05:48] brother & his daughter...
[05:57] come here
[05:59] No..
[06:01] sit here
[06:04] don't cry please
[06:06] what about people?
[06:08] they are habitual of exaggerating the matters
[06:12] everything will be alright
[06:14] don't worry
[06:15] don't know what not she had said about my daughter I can't even repeat, Shaista
[06:21] sister, don't recall it. Just forget everything
[06:24] how will she face?
[06:27] how my Zara will face such people?
[06:31] God is great, everything will be alright
[06:35] you didn't see, Shaista. How she was talking
[06:43] you know how this society is, they won't let my daughter stay alive
[06:47] this allegation won't let her live, what will my daughter do?
[06:53] at least you show some patience, why are you losing hope?
[06:56] if you will loose hope, then who will handle Zara?
[07:00] she will be shattered more, for God sake please show some courage
[07:04] even Zara heard it too
[07:11] I can't bear it, then how will she be able to tolerate it?
[07:15] how will she?
[07:17] brother Manzoor is with her, he will handle Zara
[07:23] and sister, I am sure that Zara will handle herself
[07:28] she is very brave
[07:31] just show some courage & don't be worried like this
[07:34] How... how shall I gather courage?
[07:38] see, even your hands are cold
[07:43] please don't cry, everything will be fine
[07:47] everything will be alright
[07:59] why aunt is doing this, dad? Why she doesn't believe me?
[08:04] you know that I haven't done any such thing
[08:07] she is distrustful from your side
[08:10] that's why she won't believe any of your words
[08:12] so take me to her, I will clear her misunderstanding
[08:17] dear...
[08:18] please dad, take me to her. I want to talk to her & explain that its just an allegation nothing else
[08:25] don't insist
[08:27] she won't listen to you at all
[08:28] why she won't listen to me? Even you people are listening things because of me
[08:32] mom is so ashamed, your head is also down with shame
[08:35] I can't see all this, dad
[08:39] why I got saved? Why I haven't died with Adeel on that day in the accident?
[08:43] what's wrong, dear?
[08:45] life & death is in God's hands, why are you saying such things?
[08:49] so what shall I do, dad? Nobody is believing me
[08:52] no matter what this society says
[08:55] we believe you
[09:02] do you know
[09:05] Its the most easiest thing in this society to point a finger on anyone's character
[09:12] when a person doesn't find any mistake against anyone
[09:16] and doesn't get any point to show hatred
[09:22] then the first thing he does is attacking on one's character
[09:25] but dad, I have never done bad to anyone or thought bad about anyone then why all of this is happening with me?
[09:32] why I've become a trial for you people?
[09:34] the time doesn't stay same, my child
[09:38] its a trial, this time shall soon pass
[09:42] everything is thinking that I am the bad one
[09:44] let anyone say anything, there is no need to present your clarification. Are you at mistake?
[09:50] if yes, then present your clarification. Else what's the need of it?
[09:55] One day, the truth will come in front of all
[10:01] people who stabs you back are coward
[10:05] we don't fear such people, but we compete with them confidently!
[10:13] everyone faces good & bad situation in their lives
[10:16] but it doesn't mean that one shall waste their entire life because of such situation
[10:24] gather some courage
[10:28] forget the past
[10:32] live confidently, my child
[10:35] start a new life
[10:37] and remember
[10:40] I am always standing by your side
[12:16] that will go now
[12:19] Greetings!*
[12:22] Welcome!
[12:24] so you guys are playing carom
[12:26] let me play as well
[12:28] its Zaini's turn
[12:32] hmm...
nice
[12:37] Zara
[12:39] Zara? Its your turn
[12:41] its Zara's turn
[12:51] wow...
[13:01] which one shall I go for?
[13:19] you've completed Islamabad's target, so what's your plan now?
[13:25] dad, I've applied at a few places. God willing soon I will get a good job
[13:30] do one thing, visit Mr. Rashid along with me
[13:34] his son is a very big businessman, he will help you for sure
[13:38] dad, I want to get a job on my merit
[13:42] not on somebody's recommendation
[13:45] its not the matter of any recommendation or support, they are our old clients
[13:50] we have visited them many time, so I think we should seek their help in this situation
[13:56] that fine dad
[13:58] but I don't want to take anyone's favor
[14:01] my education, my experience all is fine. Somehow I will get a good job
[14:05] don't take tension
[14:07] for sure you'll get a job my dear, if God wills
[14:11] but what about your fathers business? Since you are our only son, who is going to manage that?
[14:20] mom, I can help dad along with my job
[14:25] won't it be difficult for you to manage both the work?
[14:27] mom, don't take tension. I will manage
[14:32] I just want the support of both of you
[14:36] our support will be with you for lifetime
[14:54] aunty... please no
[15:01] take it
 No...
[17:03] what are you doing?
[17:05] you got scared, and you've scared me too
[17:08] what's wrong? I am Adnan not some stranger. You see me daily
[17:11] what happened?
[17:12] what are you doing here?
[17:13] nothing! I just saw you working so I thought of helping you. Let me water the plants
[17:18] I will do it
[17:20] hey.. the water will get wasted. Let me do it
[17:29] where are you going?
[17:30] what are you doing? Leave my path
[17:32] at least listen to me, I hardly get a chance to talk to you. Mostly you are surrounded by people
[17:37] today I got a chance to speak to you & you are leaving
[17:40] you are crossing your limits!
[17:41] I am not crossing my limits. I just want to be friends with you, we will sit & talk
[17:45] at least listen to me...
hey...
[18:33] what is this happening?
[18:35] nothing brother, I was just watering the plants
[18:39] No, I don't have problem or worries from your side
[18:44] but brother, you seem worried. Is everything fine?
[18:49] Nothing! I am just worried for Zara that..
[18:53] what is going to happen to her
[18:54] you can share it with me brother, tell me what's the matter?
[18:57] Adnan look, Ali will get a job
[19:00] he will get busy in his life, Zaini will also get married
[19:04] what about Zara, what she will do in the future?
[19:07] get Zara remarried, that's it
[19:09] marriage?
[19:10] yes yes, what's the harm in doing the second marriage?
[19:13] brother, Zara is well educated & young girl. We'll get some good suitor for her
[19:18] you already know that she is a widow then how come a good suitor for a widow?
[19:23] don't you worry at all
[19:26] I will find one, I will find a great suitor. Ok?
[19:31] may God help you, thank you so much!
[19:33] don't you worry at all, brother
[19:52] I have brought your favorite cake
[20:14] why are you quiet?
[20:17] is everything fine?
[20:20] Saad...
[20:21] Oh... so, today you've brought Zara's favorite cake
[20:28] what have you brought for me?
[20:31] for you? You haven't asked me for anything. If you had, then I would have brought it for sure
[20:36] as it is, I have brought it as per my will
[20:40] hmm...
[20:41] you did well
[20:50] where are you going?
[20:52] No where, just like that
[20:56] sit here Zaini, lets have cake together
[21:15] Adnan has given a suggestion
[21:19] really! What?
[21:22] about Zara's second marriage
[21:27] what?
[21:33] what's the matter Zaini?
 sit
[21:37] yes..
[21:40] cake
[21:41] yes, lets eat
[21:50] by the way Zara you are quite selfish
[21:53] you didn't even asked me once that what I am doing & where I am working
[21:57] its not like that, Saad
[21:59] I am sure that wherever you are doing the job must be a very good company
[22:03] that's why you have accepted that job
[22:06] yes, true that
[22:08] there is a company on II Chudrigar road namely Zaviyar. All the clients are UK based
[22:13] by the way, if you say so then shall I forward your CV too?
[22:17] Job & I?
[22:22] so what's the harm in it? You can also try
[22:26] I cannot do the job, Saad
[22:28] why?
[22:30] I won't be able to do it
[22:31] why are you getting worried? I am there
[22:34] anyways, whenever you feel appropriate you can let me know. I will help you in making the CV
[22:48] you also say something
[22:52] what shall I say?
[22:54] you guys are busy in talking
[22:59] you can also talk, Zaini
[23:02] earlier, you used to talk a lot. But now you don't talk to me at all
[23:07] because there is a lot of difference in earlier times & now
[23:11] I didn't get it
[23:15] nothing
[23:17] I was thinking to apply for Masters program after my exams
[23:22] its such a good thing, Zaini. Right Saad?
[23:25] yes, true that
[23:27] by the way, in which subject you will do the masters?
[23:29] the cake is lying since long time, shall we eat it if you guys are done talking?
[23:43] is it enough?
[23:44] yes?
yes
[23:49] well, you know that I really don't like chocolate cake
[23:52] but you like it, also Zara likes it too
[23:56] here you go
[23:58] thank you!
[24:08] get Zara remarried, that's it
[24:10] marriage?
[24:11] yes yes, what's the harm in doing the second marriage?
brother, Zara is well educated & young girl. 
[24:17] We'll get some good suitor for her
[24:30] Mr. Manzoor
[24:32] what are you doing here so late night?
[24:35] you had gone to sleep, so why did you wake up?
[24:39] if I ask you the same question, then?
[24:44] why did you wake up & came here?
[24:46] sometimes, it happens that the sleep vanishes from your eyes
[24:52] what's the matter?
[24:54] you seem worried to me
[24:57] I am thinking something
[25:00] what are you thinking? At least tell me
[25:04] I don't know, whether its appropriate to say it or not
[25:10] time is such a weird thing
[25:14] sometimes, it makes your life so easy that every task happens in a blink of an eye
[25:20] and sometimes it makes the things so difficult that if you try solving it it gets more complicated
[27:18] now you are worrying me
[27:20] tell me, what's the matter?
[27:22] actually... Adnan has given a suggestion
[27:28] really! What?
[27:32] about Zara's second marriage
[27:36] what?
[27:41] dad
[27:43] Zara..
[27:49] hey dear, you haven't slept?
[27:52] why are you guys sitting outside at this hour?
[27:55] I was feeling anxious, so I thought of sitting in the open air
[28:02] but your mom didn't spared me alone time over here as well
[28:06] why you haven't slept as of yet?
[28:10] actually I..
[28:11] well its good, come sit
[28:14] its good to sit in the open air, as its good for one's health
[28:26] here you go..
[28:28] even their light is on, means they are awake too
[28:31] yes, everything is so good
[28:34] we have quite an ease because of Adnan
[28:37] you know about NIPA area's shop, he takes care of everything
[28:41] even he has quite a lot of house responsibilities too. I am so grateful to him
[28:46] we are so lucky that God has given us such a nice & sincere people
[28:55] even our own blood relatives leaves us in this world...
[29:00] yet she is my distant sister
[29:05] yes?
[29:06] shall we drink tea?
[29:09] at this hour?
[29:10] yes, it will be a party
[29:13] let me bring it right away
[29:16] what is this time to drink tea?
[29:20] I was just diverting her mind
[29:22] you should have slept by now
[29:24] she understands everything
[29:26] everything!
[31:00] to whom you're calling?
[31:02] no one
[31:04] you cannot hide it from my anymore
[31:07] you must be calling Sarwat, right?
[31:10] what happened?
[31:12] Didn't she receive your call?
[31:14] mind your own business!
[31:15] oh yes! your sister & her family is selfish
[31:20] who ate away my family's happiness for the sake of their benefit
[31:25] where are you going?
[31:27] can't you hear anything about your sister?
[31:31] anyways, its nothing new
[31:34] I've been observing the same thing since I got married to you
[31:40] that you have never given any importance to my any word ever
[31:45] you always did whatever is against my will
[31:51] see, if any of your words have any importance
[31:58] then I would have listened to you for sure
[32:01] but all of your words are unimportant like your soul
[32:09] God has given you all the happiness & blessings 
[32:15] but you have never been grateful to God
[32:20] and today the point on which we are standing
[32:24] its the consequences of this ungratefulness
[32:28] Wow, Mr. Ahmed!
[32:31] you've said such a great thing. I shall bow down in front of you
[32:38] Sarwat & her daughter did a great magic on you
[32:43] means, if you don't get to say anything else so you've pronounced me ungrateful. That's great!
[32:51] and what do you think about your great dear sister, Ms. Sarwat. What is she?
[32:58] Enough!
[33:00] Enough Fareeda, I won't hear a single word anymore
[33:06] you have already separated me from my sister
[33:09] what else do you want now?
[33:12] spare me! Please
[33:18] what as such I have said?
[33:24] this is great!
[33:27] he takes out all of his anger on me
[33:39] mom, whose call it was?
[33:41] my brother's
[33:43] so you didn't talk to him?
[33:45] what shall I talk about?
[33:47] mom, maybe he wants to discuss an important matter with you
[33:51] maybe, he has realized his mistake
[33:54] and he wants to bring back Zara to his house
[33:59] what difference does it make, if he has realized it now?
[34:03] we hardly have any relation left now
[34:10] don't tell Zara that her uncle had called
[34:13] but mom we shouldn't hide this matter from Zara as well
[34:15] as I said, no need to tell her. So don't!
[34:18] she came out of this torment with such a difficulty, & now you want me to tell this to her again
[34:22] and she'll get occupied with the same thoughts once again. No!
[34:26] Okay
[34:28] I won't tell her
[34:31] and try to stay with your sister, understand?
[34:35] don't know for how long that poor girl was wide awake even last night
[34:43] don't know what thoughts used to come in her mind while sitting alone
[34:48] care a bit for her
[34:52] she is your sister, my dear
[35:25] are you going somewhere?
[35:27] yes
[35:28] where are you going?
[35:32] to a friend's place. Would you like to come along?
Come on, come with me
[35:39] I was asking this because I want us to have dinner somewhere outside at night
[35:45] I think, you have quite a lot of money
[35:47] give them to me. You have some, give it to me
[35:51] No, I don't have money but maybe you don't remember but I do
[35:57] its been 15 years to our marriage
[36:02] 15 years!
[36:03] yes, its been 15 years
[36:06] I thought of going somewhere outside to celebrate it & have dinner
[36:12] leave it, and don't tell anyone that we've been married for 15 years
[36:17] why I shouldn't?
[36:19] just like that, because of the evil eye. People will say that tits been 15 years to their marriage
[36:25] Okay fine, I won't say
[36:27] but will we go in the evening?
We'll cut the cake as well
[36:30] do one thing, make a nice semolina dessert at home
[36:34] I will come back at night, then we'll celebrate it together & have dessert
[36:39] Ok fine, prepare a nice semolina dessert
[36:43] I'm leaving now
[36:48] prepare semolina dessert!
