[01:02] Zara? Wait here. Why are you here?
[01:07] I have to talk to uncle.
[01:09] Really? So that the limited breathes he have to live, you stop them too?
[01:14] Why would I want that, aunt?
[01:17] You're the only cause of his condition right now.
[01:21] I'll not let you talk to him. Understand?
[01:24] Please let me talk to him. I'll clear whatever misunderstandings he has.
[01:29] You'll now say whatever you want to say in front of your parents.
[01:33] Aunt, you'll not say anything to mom and dad.
[01:36] Why won't I?
[01:38] They should also know what their daughter is doing in this house.
[01:43] Aunt, my parents will die. Don't be so harsh.
[01:46] Really? And whatever you've done with us, what about that?
[01:51] You took away my son from me.
[01:53] You destroyed Mahi's life and now you're after my husband's life.
[01:58] I'll not even let your shadow fall on my family now.
[02:00] Please listen to me once.
[02:02] Enough. Whatever lies and truths you have to tell, let your parents come.
[02:09] You can tell them all. Understand?
[02:50] Why are you here? Leave from here.
[02:52] Don't be loud. Dad isn't well.
[02:54] I'll not quiet down. Why did you do this?
[02:58] What did you get from all this?
[02:59] Shut up with your nonsense.
I will not.
[03:02] You can fool mom and dad but not me.
[03:06] I know the truth.
[03:09] In fact, I'll go to mom and dad and tell them. Its all your planning. You're a liar.
[03:14] Go.
[03:16] What will you tell them? That boy came to meet you and not Zara.
[03:21] And he didn't even come for the first time.
[03:23] He has already come a lot of times. Go and tell them.
[03:26] Why are you doing this? I love him.
[03:30] Its all nonsense. He lies. He doesn't love you.
[03:33] You're the one, whose lying.
[03:36] Am I lying? I?
[03:40] Alright then..
[03:44] Then hear it yourself.
[03:47] I'll leave Mirha. Please delete this.
[03:58] You'll have to do something for me.
[04:01] This isn't so easy.
[04:03] Alright. Then I'll show this video to the police.
[04:07] So you're blackmailing me.
[04:08] No. I'm helping you escape prison.
[04:13] And what if I don't do any such thing?
[04:14] You have no other option.
[04:18] Alright. If I help you,
[04:21] will you delete this video?
[04:23] Of course I'll delete this video.
[04:26] And I'll also pay you for your work. But for that, you'll have to tell me the truth.
[04:34] Do you really love Mirha or were you fooling her for her money?
[04:39] What are you saying?
[04:40] Did I say something wrong?
[04:42] Tell me the truth. Aren't you fooling Mirha? You don't love her.
[04:49] You're just eyeing her money.
[04:53] Actually...
[04:53] Don't lie. I just want the truth from you today.
[05:00] Why did you trap Mirha with your love?
[05:04] You'll only tell me the truth today or else I'll call the police.
[05:07] No. Please don't do that.
[05:11] I'll tell you the truth.
[05:16] I don't love Mirha.
[05:19] My friendship was only for her money.
[05:24] I was in a big debt and I wanted to repay it through Mirha.
[05:30] I don't have anyone in my family.
[05:38] And when I saw Mirha in the college for the first time, I had decided,
[05:44] I'd reach out to her.
[05:55] This is the truth.
[06:12] Did you hear it? Now do you believe me?
[06:16] I wanted to show you something else as well. Here.
[06:34] Didn't I tell you?
[06:37] He isn't a good man.
[06:40] That day, Aquib was involved with the robbers.
[06:43] He isn't a good guy.
Why did he do this to me, Mahi?
[06:50] Mirha..
[06:53] some people don't deserve love. They just deserve to be hated.
[07:55] Why is this happening with me? Why am I trapped in a whirlpool of problems?
[08:01] God please show me a way out. I want to come out of this horrible nightmare.
[08:05] Please help me.
[08:10] How can I prove my innocence?
[08:12] You know the truth. Please help me.
[08:27] When mom and dad finds out, they'll not be able to bear it.
[09:06] Thank you so much.
Its good to meet you. We'll meet again.
[09:10] Alright. Bye.
[09:16] Yes, where is Saad.
[09:20] I don't know.
[09:21] I know. He left.
[09:25] To Zara.
[09:28] How can you be so sure?
[09:29] I am so sure because he was talking on the phone and said he'd come right away. He must have gone to Zara.
[09:35] See, this is such an important event. His sister is getting married.
[09:40] He'll only go to Zara leaving all this. He doesn't value you. Isn't it?
[09:46] I'm here to give you company. See, this is such good weather and such a good event.
[09:51] So many guests with beautiful faces.
[09:56] Saad, when did you come?
[10:00] When you were talking to Zaini.
[10:04] Zaini, what did he say?
[10:06] I'll tell you what I was saying. You weren't here. She was getting bored so I came to give her company.
[10:12] Now you're here. Talk. Give her company.
[10:15] Alright, Zaini I'll leave. Okay Saad.
[10:18] Enjoy..
[10:24] Stay away from him.
[10:26] and where did you go?
[10:28] A friend of mine called. His car broke down. I went to drop his family.
[10:33] Alright.
[10:35] Alright, lets go inside now.
[11:08] Yes? How are you Maheen?
[11:10] Why did you call?
[11:13] To tell you that we're not tolerating your sister in our house anymore.
[11:17] Get her things and take her back.
[11:18] What nonsense is this? Are you out of your mind?
[11:21] I am right in my mind and my intention is rock solid.
[11:23] What are you saying?
[11:26] Oh, I thought you were the only one in your house but your sister is way ahead of you.
[11:31] Mahi, don't make me guess stupid riddles.
[11:33] Tell me clearly, what happened to Zara?
[11:36] If you worry about her so much, why did you leave her here?
[11:40] We didn't leave her there, understand? You people stopped her.
[11:43] Alright. So now we're throwing her out. Come and take her back.
[11:48] Mahi, are you in your senses? If you even put a scratch on Zara, I'll tear your face apart.
[11:55] Oh my God. Such anger?!
[11:59] Come and take your sister. She has blackened her face here.
[12:03] How dare you say such a thing about Zara, Mahi?
[12:08] Mahi!
[12:33] Zaini.. Zara..
[12:35] Who told you?
[12:37] I'm telling you. Mahi called. She said to come and take Zara away.
[12:41] Oh God. What are they doing with my daughter?
[12:45] I've been calling since morning. Nobody was answering.
[12:48] Get a grip on yourself.
[12:50] Please take me to my daughter. If my sister in law throws my daughter out, where will she go?
[12:55] what will she do? What is she doing, Manzoor?
[12:58] Are you telling the truth, did Mahi tell you this?
[13:00] Why would I lie to you dad? Mahi called. She said all this.
[13:06] She's right. I'm telling you. I was upset since morning.
[13:11] I felt something bad was happening with Zara.
[13:13] Aunty, don't worry. We'll just go and visit Zara.
[13:16] Take me along. Take me instantly, dear.
[13:19] Mom, don't worry. We'll leave immediately. Dad, I'll get the car.
[13:25] Come.
Alright. Go fast.
[13:27] You people stay at home.
Should I come with you?
[13:31] Please pray. I'll go there and call you.
I'll go with them.
[13:37] I'll go.
[13:46] Mahi was very angry. I am scared. What if they did something bad to Zara?
[14:02] Did you see?Your brother again threw me out like a fly from milk.
[14:09] What would you have done there?
[14:12] Alright. So what will Saad do there?
[14:14] Saad is a different case. He is their to-be son in law.
[14:18] Alright. Saad is their son in law.
[14:22] And what am I?
[14:23] what?
[14:24] I am his brother in law. I have a right to go.
[14:28] Let it be. What are you discussing?
[14:30] I'm worried thinking what happened there
[14:36] that Mahi called Maheen and insulted her so much.
[14:39] You shouldn't worry about anything at all. You'll see Saad will be the backbone of everything.
[14:45] What?
[14:46] Yes. Zara has nobody other than Saad. You'll see the two of them will be caught.
[14:52] Why do you speak such nonsense?
[14:55] Saad is a very respectable boy.
[14:57] Of course. Saad is respectable and I?
[15:01] Your husband is the cheapest thug on Earth, isn't it?
[15:06] I didn't want to get involved in Dolly's ceremony.
[15:10] I was forced.
[15:11] What do you mean? Do you still doubt me?
[15:14] No.
[15:16] Listen to me. Throw away the trash in your mind.
[15:20] You'll get sick some day. You keep thinking stupid things.
[15:24] Dolly is the daughter in law of this house.
[15:27] Clean your mind.
[15:29] You're making me sick! Turn off the lights. I'm sleepy.
[15:38] Turn off the lights.
[15:40] I have a few things to do. I'll finish them and then turn off the lights. You go to sleep.
[15:45] Go and turn off the lights.
I'll do that.
[16:09] Saad, how long before we reach, dear?
[16:11] Aunty, we're almost there.
[17:09] What have you done to my daughter?
[17:16] The innocent daughter, you're sympathizing with, Sarwat.
[17:22] If you find out what she did, you'll strangle her yourself.
[17:31] What is she saying?
[17:34] What did she do? My daughter isn't like that. You must be mistaken.
[17:38] I'm not mistaken.
[17:41] We caught her ourselves with that boy in her room. Red handed.
[17:47] Enough. Don't accuse my daughter of something so big.
[17:53] This is the truth, brother Manzoor.
[17:57] We thought you people were very respectable
[18:01] but you've given a free hand to your daughters.
[18:05] They can have an affair with anyone and whenever they want to. There's no problem.
[18:09] Enough aunty!
[18:13] You're speaking way too much.
[18:15] Come on now. There's another supporter of Zara. Did you see?
[18:22] You're not way behind anybody else.
[18:25] I have complete faith, you too would have had an affair with Zara in the past.
[18:31] Enough! What are you saying?!
[18:35] Enough Fareeda. What are you saying?
[18:39] You will not interfere at all, Mr. Ahmed.
[18:43] Whatever is happening, is because of you.
[18:48] You were insistent on making this girl as the daughter in law of our house.
[18:52] Now did you see the consequences of this.
[18:58] She has gotten us insulted. She has left us unable to show our face to anyone.
[19:05] Enough Fareeda.
[19:07] You're accusing my daughter. Do you have any proof?
[19:12] Proof?
[19:15] My eyes are the witness.
[19:18] We saw her with that boy in the room, with our own eyes.
[19:24] And she has saved that boy's number in her phone as Saad.
[19:29] Do you need another proof?
Enough Fareeda. Enough!
[19:34] Don't accuse my daughter of something so big.
[19:37] I cannot accept it. I cannot.
[19:42] Then don't. Don't accept it.
[19:45] But now we'll not keep this trash in our house anymore.
[19:50] Do us a favor and take her away forever, from here.
[19:55] Mom, I cannot even think about it. How can I even do that?
[19:59] Dad I cannot do that. You can ask me to swear upon anything.
[20:04] I don't even know him. I don't know how he came in my room.
[20:10] Zara, we trust you.
[20:13] Come on now. Do you people see?
[20:17] How he is pining like her lover? He has no shame or care.
[20:25] We had heard that even a witch attacks leaving seven houses
[20:31] but she has destroyed her own sister's house.
Aunt Please!
[20:37] You cannot point a finger at Zara's character like this?
[20:40] How are you talking to my mother?
[20:42] Don't you see how your mother is accusing Zara?
So? She's right.
[20:49] Your sister ruined our reputation. She deserves this.
[20:53] Stop it. Its enough.
[20:58] Why don't you make them quiet, Ahmed?
She's saying whatever she wants to say.
[21:05] Sarwat..
[21:08] it would be better if you take your daughter along.
[22:15] Come on dear. We'll leave from here.
[22:19] Ali, get your sister's things.
[22:26] You're taking your daughter. Now take care. Keep an eye on her.
[22:33] In fact I'll advise you to get her married for the second time, as soon as possible.
[22:45] The gift that you've given us, Fareeda.
[22:49] After this, we don't need any of your advises.
[22:58] All of you have destroyed my daughter together.
[23:04] I'll not forgive you. Not at all.
[23:13] You told me Ahmed, that you'll keep my Zara as your daughter.
[23:20] You'll not let even a scratch come to her.
[23:23] This is how you took care of her.
[23:26] You made my daughter a culprit in front of everyone.
[23:32] You couldn't make your wife quiet. She kept on saying whatever she wanted to say.
[23:37] Stay in your limits, Sarwat.
[23:40] I'm elder than you.
[23:41] If you're elder, prove it.
[23:45] You shouldn't have called us here to insult us.
[23:47] And you wouldn't have created a spectacle of your daughter in law's respect.
[23:50] She isn't my daughter in law.
[23:52] My son is dead and with him, this relationship of a mother and daughter in law is also dead.
[23:59] Now do us a favor, take this present forever from our house.
Come on.
[24:06] In fact, we don't have any relation with you people.
[24:12] Whatever you've done with my daughter, remember it. You'll have to account for it.
[24:19] You'll regret it. All of you will regret it and it will be very late then.
[24:27] Come on Sarwat.
[24:31] Wait a minute Zara.
[24:35] You cannot leave from here, like this.
[24:43] God knows what will be happening there.
[24:49] I don't know.
[24:52] What did Mahi tell you?
[24:56] All nonsense.
[24:58] But how can she accuse her of something so serious?
[25:02] What are you trying to say? Did Zara do something wrong?
[25:06] No. Maheen, I don't mean to say that.
[25:10] I mean. How can someone accuse Zara of something so serious?
[25:14] Dolly I'll tell you as soon as I find out.
[25:20] Why are you upset with me?
[25:22] Alright. Why are you people arguing?
[25:26] God knows what must be happening with Zara, there. I'm worried about her.
[25:31] Should I call Ali and ask?
[25:33] There's no need. They must have reached there, call later.
[25:37] All of us were so happy.
[25:42] Someone cast an evil eye on our happiness.
[25:45] I was telling mom to stay there for a few more days and let Zara come.
[25:50] But nobody listened to me.
[25:53] I was already doubtful that something might happen.
[25:58] What do you mean Maheen?
[26:01] Are you taunting me? Am I a bad omen?
[26:06] I didn't say anything about you. I'm sharing my feelings with my sister.
[26:11] If you feel that this is all because of you, it must be then.
[26:17] Oh well..
[26:19] It had to happen and so it did.
[26:23] Sometimes someone's envy also eats up someone's happiness.
[26:28] Anyways, I'll make tea. I have to give medicine to mom as well. Will you have some?
[26:33] No.
[26:41] Did you see her?
[26:43] I don't know. I'm worried about Zara right now.
[27:01] Whats wrong Mahi?
[27:04] Why are you stopping her? Let her go.
[27:07] Just one last thing.
[27:10] I want Zara to remove all marks before she leaves this house.
[27:19] Be clear, what do you want to say?
[27:22] She'll return everything Adeel gave her. Its our right, not hers.
[27:26] What things?
[27:30] I have nothing with me except Adeel's memories, Mahi.
[27:34] You do, have Zara.
[27:36] The house Adeel named to you.
[27:39] Give me the papers of that house and go wherever you want to go.
[27:47] House?
[27:50] Adeel gave that house to Zara. How can you take that?
[27:55] Why can't I take it, dad?
[27:59] It is my brother's memoir.
[28:03] I will not let her have it at any cost.
[28:06] It was my brother's house. We have a right to it. Not you.
[28:12] It is good that we saw her real face. Who knows,
[28:19] she would have squandered my brother and father's hard earned money on boys like him.
[28:27] Hold your tongue, Mahi.
[28:31] Aren't you ashamed to use such words for my daughter?
[28:38] Why are you shouting at Mahi?
[28:40] Ask your daughter. She created all this mess.
[28:45] God forbid, you've made my house a battle ground.
[28:50] You're standing in my house and shouting at my daughter.
[28:55] And whatever you're doing with my daughter... Is that right?
[29:00] We will treat people however they deserve to be treated.
[29:07] Zara, what is Mahi saying?
[29:11] Give her the file back. Where is it?
[29:36] Mom, take your medicine.
Yes, give it to me.
[29:52] What happened to you?
[29:56] Nothing.
[29:58] Zaini and Maheen left all alone and you didn't stop them?
[30:03] What would they have done by staying here? Its good that they left.
[30:06] Why are you saying this?
[30:11] Mom.. Maheen is so ill mannered. She thinks I'm a kid that I won't say anything.
[30:17] She was indirectly calling me ill fortune.
[30:20] Maheen?
Yes!
[30:23] But why? Why did she say that?
[30:27] After whatever happened with Zara on my wedding..
[30:31] She said if the wedding had been finalized according to her, nothing would have happened.
[30:35]  Is this they way?
See, dear..
[30:38] Nobody is a bad omen for anyone.
[30:41]  This is all our perception and they've rusted in our mind. 
[30:48] The best way is to clear your heart of this rust.
[30:53]  Don't let these thoughts come in your mind.
[30:57] Dear, Maheen is a child. She insensible. She doesn't know what to say or do.
[31:04] Mom, why is she like this?
[31:06] She hurts me so much with her words.
[31:09] Leave everything. Tell me, did you talk to Saad? What did he say?
[31:16] I haven't talked to him, mom. I've been calling, he isn't answering.
[31:21] Alright. Now don't call him back. He'll be worried.
[31:27] God knows how Zara must be? 
What situation she might be in...
[31:35] Alright.. I'll go and offer prayers. I'll pray for everyone.
[31:56] There's nothing inside this, Mahi.
Where is the file?!
[33:08] Oh God.. you're the most merciful. 
[33:13] All praise is for you. You know the secrets of all our hearts.
[33:22] You know our intentions. 
[33:25] God, take care of my children. 
[33:30] Our Zara is in a problem right now.
[33:33] Keep her safe from all those shrewd people. 
[33:38] Take care of her, my Lord. 
[33:42] Whatever is best for her, do the same for her, God. 
[33:49] Have mercy on that child, oh Lord.
[33:55] Have mercy my Lord. Amen.
[34:18] I didn't know they will be such cheap people.
[34:24]  Dear, if you have anything else, give it back to them.
[34:32] I don't need any of their things or their charity. 
[34:36] We have everything God has blessed us with.
[34:38] Oh really?
[34:40] Now all of this is charity for you. 
[34:45] You had no objections to anything when Adeel was alive.
[34:50] All of you wanted Adeel to settle down in Karachi. 
[34:55] You wanted him to live away from his parents, his family and fulfill your wishes.
[35:13] We had never wanted anything. Adeel wanted it.
[35:18] He wanted to leave this house because of you.
[35:21]  He knew your habits. He knew you'd never accept Zara as your daughter in law. 
[35:29] And now see..
[35:30] The same thing has happened. As soon as he died, all of you showed your true colors.
[35:39] Now enough. You don't have to talk much.
[35:43]  Mahi, did you check? Are all the papers complete?
[35:47] Yes. All papers are there.
hmm... 
[36:08] You don't have to create any dramas.
[36:16] Aunty... aunty.. No..
[36:29] Keep this. Do all the remaining dramas at your house.
[36:45] Come on dear. Take these and leave.
[37:20] I'll never forgive you. I'll never forgive you, brother. 
[37:25] Think of your sister as dead, from today.
[37:30] And you're dead to me.
[37:45] Come on now. Get out of here.
[38:06] The lesser the trash, the better.
