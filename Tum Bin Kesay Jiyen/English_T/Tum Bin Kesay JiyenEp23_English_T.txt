[00:21] I'm happy with you here.
I will not listen to anything Zara.
[00:27] I've told mother and I'm telling you.
[00:30] I will not cancel my plan at any cost.
I was missing mother.
[00:36] Is that it? Come here.
[00:39] Let me read it.
[00:44] Adeel!
[00:47] Please tell me where my son is... is he alright?
Yes he is alright.
[00:53] But he's in the hospital. He's been in an accident.
[00:56] Accident, where and how? Is he alright? Is he injured?
[01:15] Uncle?
[01:18] The doctors are saying that no one is allowed to meet him.
[01:21] What do you mean not allowed?
[01:25] How can that be?
[01:28] They won't stop me. Tell them that I'm his mother and he's my son.
[01:34] They will not stop me, they can't. 
[01:37] I want to meet him. Talk to them.
[01:42] What are you doing? You aren't saying anything. Say something.
[01:46] Fareeda calm down.
[01:52] Pray for your son. Pray for Adeel.
[01:56] This is not fair.
[01:59] Fareeda I said calm down. Please sit down.
[02:04] Sit down please. Sit and pray.
[02:14] Tell me the truth, don't lie to me.
[02:18] What are the doctors saying? How is Adeel feeling?
[02:22] He's not well uncle.
[02:24] He is in a bad state.
[02:30] What about Zara?
She's better.
[02:33] She's regained consciousness. They have taken her to get X-rays
[02:42] Are you saying that Adeel hasn't woken up yet?
[02:48] The doctors are trying their best, please be hopeful.
[02:56] I'll be right back.
[02:59] Tell them that I'm his mother. Let me go and meet him.
[03:07] Calm down.
[03:10] He's going to find out. I want to see him.
[03:20] I wonder how my son must be.
[04:34] How are you my dear?
[04:38] Uncle, where's Adeel?
Adeel...
[04:43] Please let us go, we have to take her to her room.
[04:54] Where's my son?
[04:59] Where's Adeel?
Fareeda calm down.
[05:04] Be patient and pray for him.
But where is he? Look at her, she's fine.
[05:11] How's my son? Why aren't they letting us meet him?
[05:17] Visitation is allowed in hospital. I'm his mother I'm sure they'll let me meet him.
[05:22] Calm yourself down. Mahi take care of your mother. I'll go and find out.
[05:28] What kind of hospital is this? Why aren't they letting me meet my son?
[05:36] Sit down. He's fine.
Where's Adeel?
[05:41] He'll be back from the operation theater soon.
[06:16] Saad, how much more time will it take?
[06:20] We're almost there. We'll be there in ten minutes.
[07:15] Who's this? Ahmed...
[07:19] Adeel...
Adeel!
[07:23] My Adeel!
[07:24] My Adeel! No... my son... he's my son... I won't let him go...
[07:36] I won't let my son go... they've taken my son away.
Control yourself.
[07:46] I won't let my son go... my son!
[07:54] I will die without him.
[08:01] My son... bring back my son... I will die without my son.
[08:30] Mahi... where's Zara? Where's Adeel?
[08:35] Zara is fine.
[08:38] But my brother... he's gone.
[08:43] My brother has left us.
[08:55] Brother... what is she saying? What happened to Adeel?
[09:03] He's dead. My son is dead.
[09:09] Your daughter killed my son. She took away his life!
[09:16] My son has left this Earth.
[09:21] Are you happy now? Are you here to witness our tragedy?
[09:27] Witness it! Are you happy now? My only son left me!
[09:40] Mahi.... Mahi... ask them to go away from here. I don't want to see anyone's face.
[09:54] I don't want to see anyone's face. She killed my son.
[10:14] Brother.
[10:59] Zara.
[11:07] How are you?
[11:10] How did this happen?
[11:14] Where's Adeel? I haven't seen him. I asked uncle as well. Where's Adeel?
[11:23] I'll bring Adeel.
[11:25] Saad, I want to see him.
[11:30] I'll call him.
Go and bring Adeel.
[11:37] I'll bring him.
Is Adeel okay?
[11:42] Yes, he's fine. I'll bring him.
[11:46] I want to see him, just once.
[13:22] We are helpless.
[13:41] Father.
[13:49] Why did this happen?
[13:59] Be strong father. We have to look after Zara.
[14:07] Where's Zara?
[14:10] She's on her way.
[14:13] Control yourself.
[14:30] Where's uncle Ahmed?
[15:45] Be patient my sister. He belonged to God and He has taken him back.
[15:51] We cannot do anything but be patient.
[15:57] How can I be patient?
[16:02] My child is gone. How can I be patient?
He won't come back.
[16:12] I won't be able to live without my son. How will be able to live without my son?
[16:29] Control yourself Fareeda and pray for your son.
[16:40] Where's Zara?
[16:42] Is she at the hospital?
[16:43] Why does it matter? 
[16:46] My brother isn't alive anymore, so what's the point?
[16:51] My dear, I was only asking because I wanted to know if she was fine.
[16:58] Mother told them not to go, but no one listened.
[17:08] Zara killed my brother. She didn't listen to my mother.
[17:14] Don't say such things. People are listening, what will they say?
[17:27] Mother... where's Adeel? Why isn't anyone telling me anything?
[17:35] My dear...
[17:38] Saad, where's Adeel? 
[17:42] Why are you just taking me and not Adeel from the hospital?
[17:47] Silence yourself for a while my dear.
[17:51] He's not well. Where is he?
We are going to him.
[18:01] I understand.
[18:04] You guys want to surprise me. 
[18:08] Adeel has a habit of doing that.
[18:13] Why does he have to surprise me today?
[18:20] Did you not make him understand, Saad?
[18:58] They'll be here any moment now.
[19:08] They are here.
[20:55] Zara...
Sister.
[21:01] Bring water for her please.
[21:03] Hurry up... Zara please open your eyes.
[21:09] Mother...
Zara...
[21:13] Zara...
[21:22] Adeel I kept telling you, but you didn't listen to your mother.
[21:28] If he had listened to me he would have been alive today.
[21:32] I kept saying that she is accursed, but no one listened to me.
[21:40] No one listened to me.
[21:54] Shaista! Brother Manzoor called, Adeel has passed away.
[21:58] Why are you saying such things?
[22:02] Brother Manzoor called me and told me that Adeel is no more. 
[22:07] He wasn't even able to talk properly on the phone...
[22:10] He was crying...
Adnan...
[22:14] None us could have ever imagined this.
[22:18] Zara is so young.
In her youth..
[22:23] she has been widowed.
We should go there.
[22:26] No, brother Manzoor asked us not to.
[22:28] He said that Ali would go there directly from Islamabad. 
[22:31] Brother Manzoor's relatives will be visiting. I've talked in the mosque...
[22:36] They were offer the funeral prayers here.
[22:38] Evil has taken away the happiness of those children.
[22:43] What can we do? This was all that was written for them.
[22:47] How's Zara? Does she know?
[22:51] I don't think she knows yet, but she will.
[22:54] She's with Saad, what else does she want?
[22:57] Adnan, this is not the time for such things.
[23:01] Don't say such things... we have to die one day as well.
[23:08] Pray for Adeel's forgiveness and pray that Zara find patience.
[23:13] I'll go to the mosque and check in on the prayer arrangement.
[23:31] Why did this happen?
[23:47] Mother, water.
[23:56] My Lord... that poor boy.
[24:05] Dolly... my dear we should have gone there.
[24:12] Mother, we couldn't go because of your health. 
[24:15] Everyone knows this.
[24:19] My blood pressure and these headaches just won't leave me.
[24:25] I want to be there for them. I can't stand staying here.
[24:32] Evil eyes has taken away their happiness. 
[24:35] They looked so happy on their wedding day.
[24:39] I prayed for their well being.
[24:46] Mother... whatever God wills.
[24:57] We made a mistake by staying. 
[25:00] Nothing would have happened if I went there.
[25:07] Mother.
[25:10] We can't do anything now. All we can do is pray for his forgiveness.
[25:15] May God give everyone patience. Don't cry... drink water.
[25:29] Enough. Don't cry anymore.
[26:34] They look so beautiful.
[26:39] Hmm... they look average.
[26:43] You coming here was enough.
[26:47] You didn't need to light them on fire.
[26:49] Those dialogues sound nice in a nineties film.
[26:52] No one is impressed by them anymore. But nice try.
[26:59] If it was a nice effort...
[27:03] then I should get a reward.
[27:06] What are you doing Adeel? What if someone sees?
[27:11] They'll think that your empty hands do not look nice.
[27:16] Go away from here. Everyone must be looking for us. They must be wondering where we are.
[27:22] If only... we could disappear.
[27:27] I would have taken you and disappeared.
[27:30] Let go of my hand and leave.
[27:32] Wait a second, I have something for you.
[28:05] You remembered.
You remembered as well.
[28:10] That's why you didn't wear bangles.
[28:16] Thank you Adeel.
[28:19] Anything for you.
[29:18] What are you doing? You cannot take Adeel away.
[29:23] I won't let Adeel go anywhere.
[29:53] You killed him.
[29:58] I cannot live without my son!
[30:11] Don't take Adeel away from me!
[31:37] She's so unlucky. She just got married. Last time I visited she was a bride...
[31:44] and now I'm here because of a funeral. My heart feels for them.
[31:49] This is a tragedy for that poor girl.
[31:53] The tragedy occurred in this house the day this accursed girl was married into this home.
[32:03] Her shadow is not good for this house.
[32:06] There is a reason my heart could never accept her.
[32:13] Because of her...
[32:18] I tried making Adeel understand, but he didn't listen to me.
[32:24]  If he had listened to me, he would be alive right now.
[32:28] I kept saying that she is accursed, but no one listened to me.
[32:41] What's the matter with you sister... what are you saying?
[32:46] Be mindful of what you say.
I will not.
[32:50] I am not in my senses. My son has died.
[32:57] He has been buried!
[33:01] Don't give me your advice. Ask her...
[33:06] Ask your daughter. What did I ever do to her?
[33:11] For what did she take her revenge from me?
[33:16] I always said that is not good for this house. She is accursed!
[33:25] That she would ruin everything and she did!
[33:31] Adeel would have agreed, but she dug her claws into him.
[33:40] Still you want me to say nothing. 
[33:43] You want me to stay in my senses? I will speak!
[33:48] I will tell the entire world that whatever happened was because of her!
[33:56] Her stubbornness killed my son.
[34:03] Enough auntie.
[34:06] What are you saying? 
[34:08] The one who died wasn't just your son, but he was my sister's husband.
[34:14] My sister is a widow.
She's just been widowed.
[34:19] What about what I lost? I lost my son, what does she care?
[34:29] She will find a new husband. Who will bring my son back to me?
[34:36] Who will bring my son back to me? My son has left this world.
[34:46] Adeel...
[34:47] Auntie...
Enough Zaini!
[34:51] For God's sake not one more word. This is no time to fight.
[35:01] Sister, for God's sake silence yourself.
Mother, come inside.
[35:07] Why? Why should I go inside? Ask them to leave.
[35:14] Get out of this house. Ask her to get out of my sight! I don't want to see her face!
[35:20] The funeral is over. 
[35:22] These people have no place in this house anymore!
[35:25] Go... get out of this house. I won't go inside.
[35:30] Get her out of my sight. She killed my son!
Mother I won't go.
[35:43] This is Adeel's house. I can't leave Adeel's house. Why would I kill Adeel?
[35:50] Mother... I didn't do anything. How can I kill him?
[35:58] I didn't kill him. I won't leave this house. Mother...
[36:10] Remove her from this house. 
[36:16] I can't see her face.
I won't leave this house.
[36:57] My brother loved my very much. He used to listen to me.
[37:07] He never stopped me from doing anything. 
[37:09] He always agreed with everything I said.
[37:12] Before leaving he got me talking again, so I don't require anyone's help.
[37:20] Then he left me. He didn't even think how all of us would live without him.
[37:26] Control yourself. Look what you've done to yourself.
[37:32] Will you eat something? Should I bring something for you?
[37:35] No... where's sister...
[37:37] she was crying, I'm going to her
[37:40] She has her family. Why are you worrying?
[37:45] All of this has happened because of her. Why are you worrying about her?
[37:48] What are you saying?
[37:51] This didn't happen because of her. Brother loved her.
[37:58] Sister Zara loved my brother. 
[38:01] She couldn't do something like this.
[38:08] Alright fine... don't cry please.
[38:15] I miss my brother.
[38:30] There was so much blood.
[38:34] Adeel's shirt was filled with blood.
[38:42] You saw it, right father. Auntie tried to stop us.
[38:49] She asked us not to go... she constantly told us not to go.
[38:58] But we didn't listen to her. I didn't listen to her.
[39:09] This is not your fault. 
[39:12] Why are you thinking like this? You didn't do anything wrong.
[39:15] It's my fault, I should have listened to her. If I had he would be alive today.
[39:24] This wouldn't have happened. Why didn't I listen to her?
[39:33] Why didn't I listen to her?
[39:40] Do you see her? 
[39:42] Why are you silent? Why don't you say anything?
[39:50] I will not leave you here.
[39:57] What should I tell her?
[40:00] What should I say?
[40:09] I don't have anything to say.
[40:30] I won't let my daughter stay in this hell.
[40:36] I will take you with me. I will not let you stay here.
[40:43] I should have listened to her. I didn't listen to her.
[40:52] I didn't listen.
