[01:07] How is the food?
[01:09] I'll tell you but you take this from my hand first.
[01:17] You've made such delicious food that I'm overjoyed.
[01:20] My taste buds have died after eating such pathetic food at home.
[01:25] If this is the case, why don't you come and live here with me?
[01:30] Where will I go if I leave?
[01:34] I don't understand. You praise her so much and yet you're upset with her.
[01:40] If you're giving me such good food, why are you discussing nonsense things.
[01:45] Alright I won't. But tell me where were you lost since so many days?
[01:49] You didn't even ask after me.
[01:51] I've started a new business out of town.
[01:55] I had been a bit busy. All my focus was on the work.
[01:59] But I did miss you.
You're lying.
[02:02] If you had missed me, you'd have called me.
[02:05] Who forgets you? They say,
[02:09] forgetful people fail in love and I'm your true lover.
[02:14] How can I fail?
[02:17] Will you ever deceive me?
[02:19] What are you saying? How can I deceive you? And as it is,
[02:25] Deceit and disloyalty aren't in my personality.
[02:29] This is what I love about you.
[02:32] Now finalize your business so that we can get married.
[02:35] You just pray. I'm working hard. Alright, so...
[02:40] I won't be able to meet you for a few days.
Why?
[02:44] I just told you. We've started a business out of town and Manzoor has given me a duty.
[02:50] We'll meet once that work is complete. Ok?
[02:54] This is nice. But I'll let you go on one condition.
What?
[02:59] You'll call me everyday from there?
[03:01] I'll call you twice everyday from there.
[03:05] Promise?
I promise.
[03:07] Alright
[03:09] Now you've made me eat such delicious food. Who'll get me tea?
[03:15] Sweet or without sugar.
[03:16] Without sugar.
[03:19] I'll just get it.
[03:50] Zara?
[03:53] Are you alright?
[03:56] Zaini, take your sister to her room. She'll rest.
[04:06] Dad.. What happened with Zara?
[04:23] Mom?
[04:27] Maheen sister
[04:31] Mom, come sit down. Be careful.
[05:25] Dad..
Everything is finished.
[05:34] Don't cry please. You'll get sick.
[05:38] Let me get sick.
[05:40] Let me get sick. What will I do by staying alive?
[05:51] My only sister has left me today.
[05:58] She did right. She did the right thing
[06:03] I couldn't do anything for my son. Nor for Zara.
[06:12] Dad please stop. Please.
[06:16] You'll get sick. Don't.
[06:29] They did everything knowingly.
[06:33] Accusing someone knowingly is heavier than the skies.
[06:40] Not even once did anybody's tongue falter while they assassinated my daughter's character.
[06:49] They accused her.
[06:53] Mom, Mahi and aunt wanted to throw Zara out of their house since day one.
[07:00] And its all uncle's fault. He was quiet.
[07:04] Mom, why didn't you ask uncle? He claimed to be Zara's protector.
[07:11] Why didn't he stand with her on this occasion?
[07:16] He didn't have any answer.
[07:20] He kept standing silently like a puppet.
[07:28] I've also decided.
[07:32] After today, there will be no relationship with any of them.
[07:43] Mom.. please don't cry.
[07:52] You were right, Maheen.
[07:55] I shouldn't have left Zara there because she said so.
[07:59] They accused her of something so cheap. Mahi and my sister in law did.
[08:05] How will she bear it all?
[08:08] She accepted them with all her heart.
[08:12] She never even uttered a word.
[08:15] She gave them all so much respect.
[08:20] See, what did they to my child?!
[08:31] Mom.. Zara isn't alone. All of us are with her.
[08:51] Aunty, don't worry at all.
[08:58] Zara is not alone.
[09:03] All of us will look after her together.
[09:49] Saad, are you leaving?
[09:53] I'll meet Zara before I leave.
[09:57] She's sleeping right now.
I'll wait.
[10:04] Saad.. what happened there?
[10:09] Nothing.
[10:11] I'm Zara's sister. Its important to know what happened there.
[10:15] Whats the use of repeating things based on lies?
[10:18] Saad, I asked you what happened there?
[10:21] Who was he? Does Zara know him?
[10:26] No.
[10:29] But I'll find out. No matter where he's hiding, I'll find him.
[10:34] I will not let him stay peacefully.
[10:37] How will you find out?
[10:40] I will. I will erase all stains on Zara's character.
[10:45] Alright fine. Saad.. Relax..
[10:50] Zaini.. you will not discuss anything about this with Zara.
[10:55] She needs our support not our questioning.
[11:02] I think you should go home right now. Aunty and Dolly are also worried there.
[11:10] I'll not leave without meeting Zara.
[11:12] Saad, I told you, she's sleeping.
[11:15] You can come later and meet her.
[11:18] Go right now. Change and relax.
[11:52] Saad, what happened dear? Why do you look so worried?
[11:57] Tell me what happened there?
[11:59] Mom, nothing is right.
[12:01] They threw Zara out of their house?
[12:03] what!
Threw her out? But why?
[12:07] Mom.. They accused Zara of having an affair with a boy.
[12:14] God knows how that boy got to her room.
[12:17] They didn't even give her a chance to clarify.
[12:21] They accused her of something so cheap that she..
[12:26] Mom, Zara staying there was very dangerous so we brought her back.
[12:32] Its good that you did, dear.
[12:33] You did good bringing her back. They've been mistreating that innocent child.
[12:39] How many more problems would she have borne if she had stayed there.
[12:42] You did good. And Ahmed? Didn't he say anything?
[12:46] I'm amazed at him. He took Zara as his daughter and not his daughter in law.
[12:53] Was he quiet as well? Didn't he say anything?
[12:55] Mom, even Maheen asked this question.
[12:57] All of us expected this of him. He could have spoken if he wanted to.
[13:02] He also turned his face.
[13:04] He did wrong. He shouldn't have done this.
[13:07] He should have supported her. Stood with her.
[13:10] We have brought that girl up. We know her well.
[13:15] She's his own blood.
[13:18] Mom, when a person is blindfolded by mistrust, nobody can see clearly.
[13:24] They have a cheap mentality. Conservative mindsets.
[13:30] God forgive me. Nobody is God fearing anymore.
[13:48] I didn't do anything..
[13:57] Mom, she has high fever.
[14:02] I've called the doctor. He's on his way.
[14:05] If her condition persists, we'll have to take her to the hospital.
[14:15] Zara?
[14:19] Get back in your senses, child. Zara, open your eyes.
[14:25] Don't do this to me, dear. I cannot see you like this.
[14:31] Mom, control yourself. Zara will feel sicker if you do this.
[14:37] Ask her to open her eyes. Why is she doing this to me?
[14:42] Mom, get a grip on yourself.
[14:45] The doctor is coming. Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
[14:49] Ali, you take mom to her room. I'm here with Zara.
[14:56] Mom, please come to your room.
[14:59] Maheen is here. She'll handle everything.
[15:01] The doctor is coming too. Please come.
[15:05] Please come to your room.
[15:07] what will I do by going there, Ali?
[15:09] Mom, the doctor will come. Everything will be alright. Maheen is here with Zara. Please come.
[15:16] Please come.
[15:39] Whats wrong with her, doctor? Why isn't she opening her eyes?
[15:43] She's in shock or trauma. Something has happened that has shocked her brain intensely.
[15:52] See, her position isn't good. She has weakness alongside high fever.
[15:59] And I've felt that she has gone through an incident during the check up.
[16:03] Yes, she had a miscarriage, recently.
[16:09] Hmm. So she might be so depressed because of that.
[16:14] Such situations cause this.
[16:18] If you have her reports, please show them to me.
[16:20] No. They're at her in laws'.
[16:24] See, without knowing her history, I cannot start any treatment.
[16:31] This could be dangerous for the patient.
[16:36] I'm prescribing some medicines.
[16:38] Give them to her on time. If God wills, her fever will subside soon.
[16:45] Alright.
[16:47] Thank you very much. Come, I'll drop you outside.
[16:58] Don't worry. She'll be alright.
Thank you doctor.
[17:22] Zara? Dear, open your eyes.
[17:33] Zara, open your eyes, dear..
[18:11] Finally, I've thrown you out of this house, Zara.
[18:15] What did you think? You'd stay in our house forever?
[18:22] You were very innocent.
[18:24] You surrendered so soon. I thought you'd shout and scream but,
[18:30] you were such a coward. You left your place so soon.
[18:43] Its good that you left.
[18:45] God knows what else I would have had to do with you.
[18:49] You're safe for now. But what will you do?
[18:54] Who will you show your wounds to?
[18:57] Whoever will hear will point a finger at you?!
[19:02] Poor you..
[19:14] Now, we don't need you in this house and you're no longer valued here.
[19:20] As far as these lifeless things are here. They'll be gone soon too.
[20:59] If you didn't want Adeel's child, you could have given it to me. I'd have brought it up.
[21:05] We would have left you alone to live life as you please.
[21:09] Aunt, what are you saying? Show some respect at least.
[21:13] I could never think of anything like this. I only have Adeel in my heart.
[21:17] What are you saying?
[22:47] Are you watching? How he's pining like a lover.
[22:51] He has no shame or reserve.
[22:56] We had heard that even a witch would attack sparing seven houses
[23:02] but she.. she has attacked her own sister's house!
Aunt please....
[23:17] Brother, why aren't you asleep yet?
[23:20] I couldn't sleep.
[23:24] Why are you still up?
[23:26] I got up to check up on mom.
[23:29] I saw the lawn's light turned on so I came here.
[23:32] How's Zara?
[23:36] She isn't good.
[23:40] Ali told me what happened there...
[23:44] It wasn't good.
[23:48] She must be in a lot of difficulty
[23:54] She is so nice. She always takes care of everyone and never thinks bad for anyone.
[24:04] God knows why such bad things are happening with her.
[24:10] God knows when will her problems end?
[24:18] Brother, some people face tests all their life.
[24:25] We can only pray that God make things easier for her.
[24:35] I always pray for her.
[24:37] Then why are you worried?
[24:40] Prayers are never left unanswered. God will make everything better.
[24:45] Amen.
Please come inside. Its late. Get some rest.
[24:51] No. You go. I want to be alone for a while.
[24:54] Alright. But come in soon. Its very late.
[26:20] How is my daughter?
[26:31] You still have a fever.
[26:34] It was very high last night.
[26:38] Come on now..
[26:40] Have your breakfast and then I'll give you, your medicine.
[27:07] Try and forget whatever happened, dear.
[27:14] You're in your own house now.
[27:26] What are you looking at dear?
[27:30] You told me,
[27:34] Adeel's house was my real house.
[27:40] But now that's not my house anymore.
[27:45] Which one is my house then, mom?
[27:53] What can I say my dear?
[27:58] Mom.. I..
[28:00] I don't know him. I don't know who he was.
[28:03] How did he come in my room. I don't know him. Do you trust me?
[28:09] Yes dear. All of us trust you. We trust you. We have complete faith on you.
[28:19] I trust my upbringing.
[28:20] Mom, he entered my room and he held me like this..
[28:25] I tried to free myself. But he didn't leave my hand, mom..
[28:31] Adeel wasn't there but he was coming. I don't know why he didn't come, mom..
[28:40] Mom, is it that Adeel doesn't trust me like everyone else? Mom, will he trust me?
[28:49] Mom.. he didn't come.. He didn't come.. Mom...
[29:12] You're here?
Yes.
[29:16] The vegetables are cut in the kitchen. Go and make lunch.
[29:18] If you've cut the vegetables, then why don't you cook as well?
[29:21] What do you mean? I'm not cooking.
[29:23] Am I the only one eating in the house that I'll do the cooking everyday.
[29:28] You've started arguing with me.
What happened?
[29:32] Mom, see.. I've told her that I've cut the vegetables and she needs to cook but she isn't.
[29:39] Why are you acting up? When did I say, I'm not cooking?
[29:44] Alright. Be quiet now. You both keep fighting all the time. Its not a good thing.
[29:50] Shehla, do some other things. I'll see to the cooking. Go.
[30:02] And you, Maheen.. you just came and you started.
[30:05] Aunty, why do you always think I'm wrong?
[30:08] Whether its my mistake or not, you always think I'm wrong
[30:13] If you don't like me much, why don't you let me and Osama live separately.
[30:17] Really?
[30:18] Allowing you to live separately would mean that I'll be forgoing my son and it won't happen until I'm alive.
[30:23] Then for God's sake, spare me because I'm fed up of all these arguments everyday.
[30:58] Shaista, is Zara here?
[31:00] Yes, she is.
[31:05] Did you meet her?
[31:07] No. I didn't but I'll have to meet her. She's all alone now, poor girl.
[31:18] Yes, its important to meet her.
[31:23] They didn't do good with the poor girl.
[31:27] What do you think? Is Zara telling the truth?
[31:30] What did you say?
[31:33] Whatever Zara is saying is the truth. There's no question of lying.
[31:37] She is telling the truth. But nobody should be accusing anyone like this.
[31:43] Adnan, don't you always tell me whatever we see might not be the truth.
[31:50] Alright, then if I say, shut your eyes this time as well.
[31:54] What?
[31:55] No. Nothing. I was just kidding. I'm upset about whatever happened with Zara.
[32:04] Of course. We all are.
[32:05] I'm going out for a walk, I feel heavy. You drink this tea.
[32:10] But I made this for you.
[32:14] You drink both the cups now. 
[32:18] I've switched off the TV.
[32:25] The second cup will go waste. I made such big cups of tea.
[33:28] Shehla?
[33:33] What happened mom?
[33:36] What are you doing?
What did I do now?
[33:40] See, Maheen is your sister in law.
[33:41]  I didn't say anything to you in front of her
[33:44]  but its becoming difficult for me trying to make you understand everyday.
[33:48] You cook everyday, what would have happened if you had cooked today as well.
[33:52] Then why is she here? If I have to do all the work..
[33:57] She cooks dinner. What else should she do?
[33:59] Ask her to make lunch as well. I cannot stand in front of the stove everyday.
[34:06] Alright then. Open your ears and listen.
[34:09]  I'll say yes to any proposal that comes for you now.
[34:15] Mom, do you want to throw me out of the house?
[34:17] I want you to get settled now. 
[34:20] Once you're married I'll think about Sawera. You're growing older everyday. I cannot sit idle.
[34:27] I understand everything. Maheen is feeding you all this.
[34:31] No dear. Its nothing. Look,
[34:36] Maheen is trying to change herself and we should give her a chance as well.
[34:42]  Dear, we should give a chance to relationships so that they become strong.
[34:48] Now you'll get married in the future. You'll also have sister in laws. 
[34:55] And if you don't give them any place in your heart,
[34:57] it would become difficult to live with them. 
[35:00] See try and give Maheen some space in your heart. Even I'm trying.
[35:07] I don't understand why are you saying all this nonsense?
[35:12] See, Maheen's family does so much to nurture relationships. 
[35:17] We should learn something from them.
[35:21] Leave everything. I cannot do all this. Look at this..
[35:25] I don't want to look at anything. 
[35:28] Maheen is your sister in law. Don't argue with her all the time.
[35:45] Aquib did everything?
Yes. 
[35:49] You were right. I shouldn't have trusted him.
[35:53] I was stupid.
[35:55] Don't cry. I knew it would happen one day when you found the truth.
[36:01] What was my fault in all this? I loved him with all my heart.
[36:06] You loved a man who didn't even deserve you.
[36:10] Forget him and focus on your studies. 
[36:13] We have exams next month. Prepare for them and forget Aquib.
[36:18] No. I've decided.
[36:20] I'll not continue my studies.
[36:22] Are you crazy? What will you do if you don't study?
[36:26] I don't know.
You're making a mistake again, Mirha. 
[36:29] Life doesn't stop if someone leaves.
[36:32] Look at your sister in law. She forget your brother so soon. 
[36:37] He loved her so much. Aquib was a fraud.
[36:43] Will you stop your life for him?
What else can I do?
[36:47] Try and complete your education. Give your exams.
[36:51]  If you study well, you'll be able to support your family, Mirha.
[36:55] What do you want? Your parents should get hurt because of you as well?
[37:00] No. I don't want any such thing.
[37:01] Then its decided. Focus on your future and forget everything else, Mirha.
[37:08] Alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Take care of yourself. Bye.
[37:52] Maheen.. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have talked to you like this
[37:59] Its alright.
[38:01] Its okay.
[38:02] Alright, mom has served dinner. Come along.
[38:06] I'm not hungry. You people eat.
[38:09] See, if you don't eat today, nobody will eat.
[38:14] I know you must be thinking why I took such a U turn all of a sudden.
[38:19] What happened so suddenly?
[38:23] Mom, made me understand. 
[38:25] Actually when you came here, we were very insecure because of you.
[38:30] But aunty liked me herself. I'm her choice then why such insecurity.
[38:37] Because we have heard that brothers change after they get married.
[38:41] We also thought the same that no matter who our brother married, she'd take away our brother from us.
[38:47] Even mom thought this when brother was interested in you. 
[38:54] This is why we didn't let you adjust in this house.
[38:59] But yes, once you left, we found out that you had not only made a place in brother's heart but also in our hearts as well.
[39:08] How can I accept that whatever you're saying, you're saying with all your heart?
[39:14] Maheen, don't test relationships.
[39:18] If you're not satisfied, you can test.
[39:22] You people must be planning something against me. I know very well.
[39:29] If we had to call off your wedding, we'd have done it long ago. Think about what I said.
[39:36] Right now. Mom has served dinner and she's calling you. Come.
