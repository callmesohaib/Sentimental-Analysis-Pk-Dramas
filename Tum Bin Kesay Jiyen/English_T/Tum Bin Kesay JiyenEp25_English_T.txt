[00:17] I'm sure you know the difference between your husband and other men.
[00:21] Auntie...
[00:21] Why are you still standing here?
[00:29] Did you not hear that her waiting period has begun? Leave this place.
[00:36] You'd be doing me a favor by taking your daughter away from this home.
[00:44] Brother, there is a difference between the environment of your home and mine.
[00:50] If I can tolerate Adeel dying then I can tolerate anything.
[01:01] When you come back don't come to meet me.
[01:52] The weather is nice right?
[01:54] Yes you're right.
[01:57] Can we take a picture.
Sure, why not?
[02:07] Try this angle.
[02:10] I think you should take it from there.
[02:15] You don't know how to take a selfie. You're supposed to hold it here.
[02:31] Look at how good this picture is.
[02:33] It's really good. I don't know how girls take fifteen pictures in one go.
[02:39] Zaini does the same.
[02:40] It's because they don't have such a professional photographer. Look at this.
[02:46] You're right. There is no one like you
[02:53] You know what. The time we are spending together, it's precious.
[03:02] I want to save it me forever.
[03:08] Show me the picture.
[03:11]  Very pretty. Can you take another one?
[03:16] I think this is enough. Shall we walk now?
Okay, let's go.
[04:17] What are you doing Zara?
[04:19] Nothing.
[04:26] I don't know what problem Maheen has with us. 
[04:29] She tried so hard to take you away.
[04:33] It's good that you didn't go.
[04:38] I wanted to say something to you.
[04:43] What is it?
[04:46] We didn't realize that you loved Adeel so much.
[04:55] Your family tried so hard but you didn't you go with them.
[05:00] You're still here.
[05:04] Today I realized that love is the biggest thing.
[05:14] I wanted to say that...
[05:19] I said a lot of things about you.
[05:24] Things I shouldn't have said.
[05:29] I don't know whether if it was our love for Adeel or the rivalry our families had.
[05:39] What are you trying to say?
[05:43] What I want to say is to forget about the past.
[05:50] I don't want you to feel anything bad for us and I don't want us to have any complaints about you. 
[05:55] Even if we do, we shouldn't mention it to each other.
[06:02] Adeel wanted this as well. 
[06:05] He wanted us all to live together.
[06:13] Like how all families live. All good families.
[06:23] What's the matter? Did I say something wrong?
[06:25] No you didn't, but maybe the time is wrong.
[06:32] We could have done all this when Adeel was alive, when he was with us.
[06:39] We could have given him this happiness while he was alive.
[06:44] That's all that Adeel wanted.
[06:53] You're right.
[06:57] But Zara it's still not too late.
[07:01] Better late than never.
[07:06] That's the least we can do.
[07:11] Right?
[07:39] Stop worrying about me Saad.
[07:44] In front of Adeel's sadness, everything seems small.
[07:49] If I can tolerate Adeel dying, then I can tolerate everything.
[08:00] When you return...
[08:03] don't come to meet me.
[08:19] Saad.
[08:22] Yes?
What are you thinking?
[08:25] I can see that you have been silent for a while. Say something,
[08:29] What should I say?
[08:32] Is there anything left for me to say?
[08:38] Are you worried for me Zaini?
Yes.
[08:43] I am worried looking at you. I've never seen you silent like this before.
[09:14] Did you have the food sent to the madrassa?
[09:19] Yes I did.
[09:26] You should have told the kids to pray for my son.
[09:41] Children are near God. There is no envy in their hearts.
[09:50] Their prayers are accepted.
[09:55] Prayer is the only thing that we can do.
[10:16] My dear, ask Zara for tea as well.
[10:20] I did. She refused.
[10:29] She's very sad. All of us need to take care of her.
[10:37] I asked her to come down and sit with us, but she didn't.
[10:44] Why would she sit with us? 
[10:47] What does she think of us? We are her enemies.
[10:53] No mother it's not like that, she's only being like that because she's worried.
[11:00] I understand your nature mother. But if Zara hears she would not like it.
[11:08] Fareeda, Zara is my niece.
[11:14] She has been widowed.
[11:17] She's in great pain.
[11:23] Right now she needs all of us.
[11:32] It would be better if you remove all hatred in your heart.
[11:40] And if you can't do that then tell me.
[11:44] I will take her to her father's home.
[11:51] Father, your tea.
Forget it. I've had it already.
[11:58] Make your mother understand that I will tolerate any sort of cruelty towards Zara.
[12:17] Drink.
[12:41] Zara.
[12:45] I'm taking this with me.
[12:51] If you keep looking at this picture you won't get better.
[12:58] I know...
[13:01] what it is like to lose someone.
[13:05] But we have to take care of ourselves.
[13:11] Think of it like that.
[13:57] Sister... what are you thinking?
[14:03] You're missing brother Adeel, right?
[14:10] I know you miss brother Adeel... he must miss you as well.
[14:17] That's how loving people are. 
[14:20] We miss them and they miss us.
[14:28] People who love live in a different world then those who don't believe in love.
[14:35] Do you know what love is?
[14:38] Everyone knows what love is.
[14:42] People who love know what love and people who become obstacles in it's way, know what love is.
[14:52] You can talk about brother Adeel with me.
[14:57] I'm the only one who can understand your feelings in this house.
[15:02] No one else.
[15:36] You have to have faith for brother Adeel.
[15:48] What? Why are you staring at me like that?
[15:54] Why are you so sympathetic towards her?
[15:57] Do whatever you want mother.
[16:01] I will not stop you. But if she leaves because of you...
[16:09] then don't come crying to me. Why don't you understand?
[16:15] She is not helpless.
[16:18]  There are many people who support her.
[16:21] She has many supporters. Maybe you didn't hear father. 
[16:26] He said that he will take her there himself.
[16:32] I lost my son because of that girl.
[16:39] I cannot tolerate when they talk about him like that.
[16:44] I don't like her at all.
[16:45] So what? Should we use that as an excuse to hurt ourselves?
[16:50] He was not only your son, he was my brother as well.
[16:56] Ask me how I feel.
[17:05] You don't know. 
[17:07] This is the only reason why I've extended my friendship towards her.
[17:13] Alright fine, do whatever you want.
[17:17] Don't expect it from me. Extend your friendship...
[17:23] but don't ask me to do it.
If you want to remove her...
[17:29] then you have to grab her first.
[17:34] Now it's up to you if you want to do it with a frown or a smile. But you have to do it.
[17:40] Please try and understand.
[17:44] I will take revenge from Zara. 
[17:47] I need to take revenge from Maheen as well.
[17:51] For my insult.
[17:54] And my brother's death.
[17:57] I will not let her leave this house so easily. 
[18:01] I will not tolerate any foolishness.
[18:06] I hate these people. I will oust Zara from this house.
[18:13] Do you know...
[18:16] I have taken away Adeel's picture from her room.
[18:22] Bit by bit I'll remove everything.
[18:27] Whatever Adeel gave her...
[18:30] I'll take it away from her.
[18:34] I will not leave anything for her.
[18:39] Not even Adeel's memories.
[18:42] Do you understand?
[19:08] She wants to control her and through him she wants to control us and this house.
[19:17] Learn from her. 
[19:19] What could be a better way to rule over her husband's heart?
[19:25] To love his family and his home! What's so wrong with it?
[20:08] Uncle?
May I come in?
[20:13] Please come in. You don't need my permission.
Thank you.
[20:19] Uncle, did you have something for me?
[20:24] My dear, I didn't see you since morning. I was waiting for you to come outside.
[20:32] I wanted to see you...
[20:37] and I wanted to talk to you.
[20:40] Please sit down.
[20:49] Come sit with me.
[20:59] My dear, I wanted to say something to you.
[21:07] Don't take what Fareeda says to heart.
[21:13] She's forced by her nature.
[21:22] When she opposes something she says whatever that comes to heart.
[21:34] My dear, I've been seeing you since you were a child.
[21:40] I'm aware of your health and I know...
[21:45] that you are sensitive.
[21:49] I've heard what Fareeda said after Adeel's death.
[22:00] My dear, please don't cry.
[22:05] You have to make yourself strong. I came here to tell you...
[22:12] to not concentrate on what Fareeda said.
[22:19] My dear, this life is very long, it's harsh...
[22:27] You'll be tested. 
[22:30] You'll have to listen and tolerate a lot of things.
[22:36] Make yourself strong.
[22:43] Remember one thing...
[22:49] I will always be with you.
[22:54] Until I'm alive. I will not leave you alone to fight this world.
[23:06] But you have to do one thing...
[23:11] don't cry.
[23:14] Don't cry, because you know... that a daughter's pain...
[23:23] is like poison.
[23:28] We still have our lives in front of us...
[23:35] We still have to live in this world.
[23:38] Without Adeel.
[24:00] I don't understand what happened. 
[24:03] Why didn't Zara come here, I was waiting for her.
[24:10] You shouldn't have waited for her. 
[24:14] She does as she likes and that's why she didn't come.
[24:17] Because she didn't want to come.
Maheen.
[24:21] She wanted to come, I'm sure brother Ahmed must have asked her to stay.
[24:26] Brother Ahmed has all of a sudden become more important than us.
[24:31] Maheen, you are being rude.
[24:33] Really! then tell me one thing?
why do we listen to everything she says in this house?
[24:40] We married her right after her engagement. I was the only one who opposed it...
[24:45] but no one listened to me. Now you realize...
[24:51] that I was right. 
[24:55] You guys have left her in that hell because she didn't want to come back.
[25:01] And still everyone is angry at me. Why is that?
[25:08] Why is everyone upset at me? What do you all want from me?
[25:13] Talk about it and let me know. Because from now on I will not speak in any matter.
[25:29] She doesn't listen to anyone. She does whatever she wants.
[25:34] Forget it sister... she's worried for her sister.
[25:46] Dolly.
Yes mother?
[25:49] Serve dinner if it's ready.
[25:50] Everyone must be hungry. Once you guys wash up I'll serve it.
[25:56] Alright my dear, call Maheen as well.
[26:00] Sure.
Forget her my dear, she'll eat when she's hungry.
[26:07] Her father has already spoiled her, she acts as though she is my mother.
[26:13] I'll have dinner served.
[26:19] Forget it sister, don't be angry. Change your clothes.
[26:27] I'll serve dinner.
[27:15] Father.
[27:23] I don't have any strength left in me.
[27:28] When I think about Zara I feel worried.
[27:35] I feel very weak.
[27:39] Father, you've always given us strength, then why are you sounding so hopeless now?
[27:49] Now matter how strong a father is...
[27:56] he breaks when he sees his daughters sad.
[28:01] Father, don't be worried about what sister said. You know how emotional she is.
[28:11] All her words can do is arise suspicion in our hearts, 
[28:14] but her words aren't the truth.
[28:17] You're the one who says that no one can change their fate.
[28:30] When tough times come one has to walk through it.
[28:35] But they should understand that whatever happened wasn't Zara's fault.
[28:41] They are torturing her.
[28:46] Pray that it doesn't happen again.
[28:54] You should talk to Zara, she will surely listen to you.
[29:03] She would have...
[29:06] But not from her heart. 
[29:09] I fear something bad might happen to her there.
[29:14] It was a hard decision to leave Zara there.
[29:21] Pray that God creates ease for your sister.
[29:29] Amen.
Uncle, Zaini dinner is served.
[29:35] Sure, we'll be right there... 
[29:37] please come with us, you haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
[29:42] Please come on.
[29:48] Come on.
[30:43] What are you doing?
Nothing. I can't decide what color to wear.
[30:50] You don't understand. Let me select.
[30:58] Look at this.
[31:00] This one will suit you.
It's good...
[31:07] but isn't it a little dark?
[31:10] It's dark? Let's look at some other option.
[31:17] Uh... look at this. I think this one...
[31:22] will suit you.
[31:27] Wait... I think that one there...
[31:33] it will suit you. This one!
[31:38] This one will suit you.
Alright.
[31:43] Just a second. I think that one there would look perfect on you.
[31:51] See... this will look perfect on you. Made for you.
[31:58] Do you know what the problem is... 
[32:00] no matter what color you wear you will look wonderful.
[32:04] I don't know which one to pick.
Isn't that too much?
[32:11] What do you mean?
[32:14] Haven't you heard the phrase, you should wear clothes as per the color not the season.
[32:21] So you know poetry as well... now don't start singing it,
[32:31] What do you mean? I sing so well.
[32:34] Yes you do... you sing so well...
[32:39] that I can't hear it. I don't have a habit of hearing such a good voice.
[32:45] So get used to it.
[32:49] When one day I'm not with you...
[32:53] then my voice will make you realize that I'm near you.
[34:01] If you're worried about me being upset, then why do you do things that I don't like?
[34:08] Because I can't listen to everything you say. 
[34:11] You should be happy.
[34:14] Our soon to be daughter-in-law already thinks that this house is hers. 
[34:18] Before we arrived, our house was clean and dinner was cooked.
[34:22] That was only for Ali. All she wants to do is control Ali and through him control this house.
[34:34] Learn from her. What could be a better way to rule her husband's heart?
[34:42] To take care of her family and his home. What's so wrong with it?
[34:48] Love should be present between relationships in a household.
[34:56] You are acting like a politician.
[35:02] Listen to one thing... if this house belongs to someone after me...
[35:08] then that's my daughter-in-law, understand?
[35:21] And if you want to rule over some place, then go to your husband's house.
[35:55] Hamza... what's the matter? If everything alright?
[36:00] No mother... there is a bad news.
[36:03] May God have mercy, what happened?
[36:07] Zara... her husband has passed away.
[36:12] From God we come and to Him we must return.
[36:17] But how did this happen?
[36:18] Do you remember the accident on the news that day...
[36:23] Adeel died in that accident.
What about Zara? Is she alright?
[36:28] Yes... my God's good grace she survived.
Thank God.
[36:35] Mother, if you could call Maheen and...
[36:43] I will... but first tell me, how did you find out? Who told you?
[36:48] Ali did. He called and told me that they returned today.
[36:55] Maheen should have been the one to call and notify you.
[37:00] But she's so stubborn, that even this accident taught her no lesson.
[37:19] Ali, where are you going?
[37:24] Where do you want to send me?
Nowhere.
[37:28] I don't want you to go anywhere. Not even Islamabad.
[37:34] I have to go to Islamabad. Islamabad won't come to me here.
[37:40] So you can't leave Islamabad for me? Is it that hard?
[37:44] Dolly, shall we go home?
[37:48] No brother, we'll stay here for a few days.
[37:53] Alright... I understand.
[37:56] No... it's nothing like that. Everyone is so worried.
[38:02] I don't feel like leaving everyone.
[38:07] Alright fine. I'll take mother with me.
[38:10] No brother, who will take care of mother at home?
[38:12] Mother will stay with me here.
[38:15] That means that Saad will have to stay here as well.
[38:20] I'm here most days.
[38:25] But some people don't like it.
[38:29] Let them feel bad. It makes no difference to us.
[38:33] Look at uncle and auntie's condition.
[38:35]  We can't leave them alone and this is my home now.
[38:43] Forget about this, I'll get going.
[38:47] Take care of yourself and mother.
Farewell.
[38:51] Be careful on your way home.
[38:55] Dolly, I have to go to Islamabad.
[38:59] I'll try to wrap things up quickly. But for now I'll have to go.
[39:08] Come in
[39:11] Zara... I was thinking that if you stay in your room you'll remain worried.
[39:20] If you start doing some chores it will distract you.
[39:26] Do you understand?
[39:29] Alright.
[39:32] I'm saying this only for you... for your well being.
[39:40] Otherwise chores were done in this house before you.
[39:46] But I'm saying this only for your distraction.
[39:49] When did I refuse?
[39:51] You cannot refuse, I'm saying this for you.
[39:58] What should I make for dinner?
[40:00] Make whatever you want.
[40:02] I'll help you out. We'll make dinner together.
[40:05] I can manage alone.
[40:07] You're refusing my offer. I can help you.
[40:13] But I can understand. Some people have a habit of working alone. 
[40:18] Maybe you are one of them.
[40:20] Anyways, I won't disturb you anymore. If you need anything else let me know.
[40:26] Okay...
