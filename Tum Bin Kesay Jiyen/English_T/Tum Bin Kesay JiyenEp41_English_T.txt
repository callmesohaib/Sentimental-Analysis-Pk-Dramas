[01:01] Hello aunty.
[01:03] Hello Saad.
[01:06] Its good that you're here.
[01:09] What happened aunty? Is Zara alright?
[01:13] Zara isn't fine, dear.
[01:17] She has been continuously crying, missing Adeel, since last night.
[01:20] She hasn't eaten anything. I took breakfast for her but she didn't even eat that.
[01:26] She's talking weirdly. I don't understand what to do.
[01:33] Its good that you came.
[01:35] Go and check up on her. Sit with her. Maybe she'll settle down.
[01:42] I'll talk to her aunty. I'll make her understand.
[01:47] May you live long my child. May God keep you happy.
[01:50] May you be healthy. Go..
[01:54] I'll go and make her understand.
[02:33] What drama is this? Why aren't you taking your medicine?
[02:37] How will you get better if you don't take medicines?
[02:41] I don't want to get better.
[02:43] Why?
[02:45] You know everything, Saad.
[02:51] I know the Zara who was a lioness.
[02:55] She was stubborn, mischievous and wanted everyone to do her bidding.
[03:01] You're not that Zara.
[03:04] She isn't as brave as she was before.
[03:08] This Zara has lost.
[03:11] This is what you think.
[03:14] Even you think I'm wrong, Saad.
[03:17] I don't think this at all. I trust you.
[03:24] Trust? You trust me?
[03:28] Then why did you bring me here? Why didn't you prove it to everyone that I didn't do anything. I wasn't at fault!
[03:34] Tell me. Answer me, Saad.
[03:36] Zara, we don't offer clarifications to everyone.
[03:39] Then what should I do? What should I do? How can I clear the accusation to my name?
[03:43] How can I tell everyone that I'm not at fault.
[03:47] We don't make everyone believe us, Zara.
[03:52] Your family trusts you. I trust you.
[04:48] You're here. How are you?
Hello uncle.
[04:52] Hello. He's here. Saad..
Really? Where is he?
[05:04] Where would he be? In Zara's room.
[05:07] Zara's room?
[05:08] Of course. When you're not at home, he's in Zara's room.
[05:13] Keep an eye out. The world is dangerous. What if someone else takes your place?
[05:20] Isn't it?
[05:22] Now I'm leaving. Alright?
[05:31] I'm leaving, okay?
[05:49] You'll have to forget everything, Zara.
[05:53] Its not easy, Saad.
[05:56] I'm here with you.
[05:59] I'll help you forget everything.
[06:04] Is it written in my life that I'll lose my loved ones?
[06:10] Of course not.
Then why did everyone leave me?
[06:21] I'm here with you.
[06:25] I'll always be with you.
[06:29] Are you telling the truth, Saad?
[06:32] Promise me, you'll not ever leave me?
[06:35] I've lost Adeel. I wouldn't want to lose my friend too.
[06:42] It won't happen. Ever.
[06:46] I'll always be with you.
[07:07] Saad..
[07:10] You're here?
[07:11] You didn't tell me you didn't go to office today.
[07:16] Actually, I wasn't feeling well today.
[07:19] Also I didn't meet Zara yesterday so I didn't go that's why.
[07:26] If you had to come home, you could have picked me from the university.
[07:33] I didn't remember it at all.
[07:40] Zara, are you alright? You must be now..
[07:47] You look pretty awake.
[07:50] Did you eat anything?
[07:52] I've been trying to make her understand that she needs to eat and not worry.
[07:56] All of us are with her. You make her understand.
[08:01] Yes. Saad is absolutely right. You need to take care of yourself.
[08:10] And the next time I come, I don't want to see you on the bed. Understand?
[08:40] Zaini? Zaini?
[08:44] What happened dear? I've been calling out your name since long.
[08:47] Mom, I didn't hear you at all.
[08:50] Saad is here, did you meet him?
[08:54] He's in Zara's room.
[08:57] I sent him there.
[09:00] Why did you?
[09:03] What are you saying?
[09:05] Nothing.
[09:08] I felt supported after Saad came.
[09:11] I couldn't even understand what to do.
[09:15] I couldn't see her worried. You were not at home, nor was your dad.
[09:22] I thanked God.
[09:26] You love Zara so much?
[09:30] You get so worried seeing her in pain.
[09:36] I'm a mother dear.
[09:38] I won't be able to see anyone of you in pain.
[09:45] Why didn't you meet Saad? Did you two fight again?
[09:48] No. I didn't fight with him.
[09:53] He should have time to argue with me.
[09:55] Alright. Get up. Lets serve lunch.
[10:00] Mom, I'm tired right now. I want to rest.
[10:04] Oh. Its lunch time.
[10:06] Saad, is here. I'll not let him go without lunch. Now get up. You can rest later
[10:11] Alright.
[10:17] Lunch is served. Come.
[10:21] First you sit here. Lets fix her mood.
[10:24] Why? What happened to your mood?
[10:27] You're weird. Is this even a question?
[10:34] Then you ask. Maybe Zara doesn't feel like talking.
[10:40] It can never be. Tell her, Zara.
[10:43] You'll make us fight now.
[10:47] Saad, please. Stop it.
[10:50] This doesn't cheer me up anymore.
[10:53] I was just kidding to make you laugh.
[10:58] She doesn't feel like talking. Don't bother her, Saad.
[11:05] Come, have lunch. Zara, you come too.
[11:10] I'm not hungry. Both of you go.
[11:15] You also come with me.
[11:18] Saad, I told you, I'm not hungry.
[11:21] Do one thing. Get lunch here. We'll eat together and I'll see how she doesn't eat.
[11:28] Why are you being stubborn, Saad?
[11:31] I want to be alone for a while. You go with Zaini.
Zara?
[11:35] Saad please...
[11:39] You come for lunch. Come.
[11:52] Alright, you get some rest.
[12:13] Yes, I know. Zara is worried.
[12:20] Even I know that. That's why I was trying to cheer her up.
[12:25] First, you need to make yourself normal.
[12:28] Have you seen yourself? You look tensed.
[12:31] I'm fine. Its alright.
[12:33] But I'm worried about you.
[12:36] You feel the pain others feel but think about yourself as well.
[12:46] Did I tell you a joke? Tell me.
[12:49] Did I tell you a joke that you're laughing so much?
You get so typical.
[12:54] Its not funny. I'm really worried about you.
[12:59] When did I deny this?
[13:02] I wasn't joking.
[13:03] I'm worried because you're worried and you're laughing at it.
[13:10] I am not laughing at your worries.
[13:15] Alright.
[13:18] You should leave now.
[13:20] Zaini, I wasn't laughing at you.
[13:35] I'm fine. Why do you worry?
[14:05] Where is Zara?
[14:08] She's in her room.
[14:18] What are you thinking?
[14:32] Zara's not fine.
[14:36] She doesn't eat or drink anything.
[14:44] She's only missing Adeel.
[14:47] When I see her in this condition, my heart is torn apart.
[14:53] If something happens to her, Manzoor, what will we do?
[14:57] God forbid that something happens to her.
[15:02] If you keep crying like this, it'll be very difficult for her to step out of this phase.
[15:12] We need to take care of her physical and mental health.
[15:18] What should I do? I cannot see her in this condition.
[15:24] Give her some time. She'll not get out of this trauma so easily.
[15:32] She was patient at the loss, her fate gave her.
[15:37] But I cannot be patient at all this.
[15:43] When we have nothing in our control, we have to leave everything on time.
[15:50] Who would have done it? And why?
[15:55] I don't know. Whom should we ask?
[16:03] Forget it as you'd forget a nightmare. The worse has passed.
[16:13] If you scratch at it, we'll be ridiculed. I don't want my daughter to turn into a spectacle.
[16:26] If things go out, people will ask questions.
[16:33] I trust my daughter completely, Manzoor.
[16:39] Even I trust her but how would I make people trust her?
[16:48] Whatever is done, its best if we leave it buried in the streets of Hyderabad.
[16:54] Its no easy. It isn't.
[16:58] Its not difficult too, Sarwat.
[17:03] You'll just have to try.
[17:07] You'll not repeat anything to Zara.
[17:11] Whatever is done. Its best to bury it.
[18:10] Beautiful..
[18:13] Thank you Adeel.
[18:16] My pleasure..
[18:21] Now you don't have to worry.
[18:37] I got you married to my son even when I didn't want it.
[18:45] And you'd be like this?
[18:49] Never in my wildest dream did I think you'd be like this.
[18:52] You forgot Adeel so soon? You didn't even care that you were a widow.
[19:17] Saad told me about Zara.
[19:20] But I didn't dare meet her. How is Zara now?
[19:29] She's better. Her fever is broken but she keeps crying.
[19:36] Of course.
[19:37] She'll settle down gradually. She'll be at peace.
[19:43] You have to pray for my Sara.
[19:48] She has seen a lot of hardships.
[19:51] You don't have to say this. I've always prayed for your children alongside mine.
[19:59] I don't know, who has cast an evil eye on us.
[20:05] God will have mercy. Don't worry.
[20:11] I'm worried about Zara too.
[20:15] She's like a daughter to me. I've always taken her as my daughter.
[20:20] And seeing her in pain, hurts me as well. I've always seen her smiling but now..
[20:30] It seems she has forgotten how to smile.
[20:35] Dear, go and call Zara.
[20:39] No. Let it be. We'll go and meet her. Lets go.
[21:38] Zara? My dear.. My life..
[21:45] Stop it my child. Be patient my child.. God had willed this to happen.
[22:02] Stop it my child...
[22:19] Don't worry my child. All of us are with you.
[24:02] Every man wants a child and its because of your negative thinking that our relationship is suffering.
[24:11] Hello.
Hello.
[24:14] How are you?
I'm fine. Give it to me. I'll keep it.
[24:22] Is everything alright?
Yes. Why? What happened?
[24:27] No.. Actually.. I had some work in the office so I got late.
[24:34] The house is very silent. Has everyone gone somewhere?
[24:37] Yes. I think aunty has gone somewhere.
[24:41] Didn't you ask her where she was going?
[24:43] She doesn't tell me where she's going and as it is, I don't interfere in her matters.
[24:53] Tell me how is Zara now?
[24:57] I couldn't talk to her. She was probably sleeping.
[25:03] You can go and meet her.
[25:09] Why are you looking at me like this?
[25:10] No. Actually aunty might object so that's why..
[25:16] Don't worry about her. I'll talk to her.
[25:21] Will you not come with me?
[25:23] No. Actually I have a new project in my office. There's a lot of work. I might not be able to accompany you.
[25:31] By the way Maheen.
[25:33] I have a dinner at my office and I'm invited. Everybody's wives will be attending.
[25:39] Will you come too?
[25:41] Of course. Why not? When do we have to go?
[25:44] Next week.
[25:45] Alright. You freshen up. I'll serve you dinner.
[26:04] Yes this is so. Dolly, you're here for the first time since we got married.
[26:12] How do you feel?
[26:14] It feels good but I wish we'd have met in different circumstances.
[26:20] I'm feeling bad for Zara, Ali.
[26:24] Yes. Even we're worried for her.
[26:30] Ali, we'll have to bring Zara out of this trauma. This won't work.
[26:35] We're trying but its not an easy task.
[26:44] Saad was telling me that Zara is mentally disturbed
[26:49] Yes. She says whats in her heart to Saad.
[26:53] But she doesn't talk to us because she knows we cannot see her like this.
[27:00] Zara and my brother have been best friends. They share everything always.
[27:06] Its because of Saad that we don't lose courage as well.
[27:10] Ali don't worry. We'll pull Zara out of this difficult time together.
[27:15] Thanks Dolly. You've supported my family a lot.
[27:21] Your family is now my family Ali. You're forgetting. We're not just engaged anymore.
[27:27] Yes. I had actually forgotten. You're my official wife now.
[27:34] What about your work? When will you be rid of it?
[27:38] I have a few tasks left. They'll be done with.
[27:41] Weren't you resigning?
Yes. I did resign but I have a few commitments.
[27:48] I told them I'd work online from here
[27:50] but now it seems I should have sat there and wind up everything.
[27:56] So what will happen now?
[27:59] Nothing. I'll finish my tasks now. You leave it. Come, I'll drop you.
[28:29] Are you telling the truth, Saad?
[28:32] Promise me you'll never leave me.
[28:35] I've lost Adeel and now I wouldn't want to lose my friend.
[28:42] It will never happen.
[28:46] I'll always be with you.
[29:13] I'm breathing because Saad is here.
[29:16] I couldn't understand what to do otherwise..
[29:20] I couldn't see her worried. You weren't home neither was your dad.
[29:27] I thanked God.
[30:53] Its been so many days. How long will you keep yourself shut in your room?
[31:01] I don't feel like doing anything.
[31:03] Let that be, Zara. Whats done is done.
[31:09] And whatever happened, we cannot stop our life because of it.
[31:14] Dad and mom both are worried because of you.
[31:21] If you shut yourself in this room, how will you pull yourself out of this darkness?
[31:29] My life is darkness now.
[31:32] Stop with this nonsense. If not for yourself, at least care about others.
[31:39] Why are you here?
[31:40] To make you understand that whatever you're doing is wrong.
[31:44] Don't come here to make me understand. Leave me be.
[31:48] Who are you doing all this for?
[31:50] You sitting and crying here will make no difference to anyone.
[31:55] How can someone be so untrustworthy so fast?
[31:59] They were my family.
They weren't your family and they can never be.
[32:05] This is what we tried to explain you earlier as well.
[32:07] And even now you're repeating the same thing.
[32:11] If you still don't stand up for yourself, you'll get buried under this burden.
[32:16] What should I do then, Maheen?
[32:19] Don't do anything. You don't have to do anything. Just,
[32:24] throw out everything from your mind. Try and be normal, Zara.
[32:31] Do you want mom and dad to be stressed because of you?
[32:38] Then get up and come outside. If you sit with everyone, you'll feel normal.
[32:45] Zara, come outside. Come on, get up.
[32:56] Come on..
[33:03] Its been so many days we're meeting again, Nusrat. Last time I met you at Asifa's house and its been long..
[33:11] Yes.
[33:12] My husband isn't well these days and I'm busy with the house work.
[33:18] So, tell me how are your daughters?
[33:21] They're fine by the grace of God.
[33:23] So, is Maheen here or is she back home?
[33:27] Maheen went back to her house but she's here today.
[33:30] She's making tea for you.
Alright. And hows Zara?
[33:36] Zara is fine as well. She's here as well. She'll come and say hello to you.
[33:41] Alright.
[33:43] Is it this or are you hiding something?
What do you mean?
[33:49] You're acting as if you don't know anything.
What? What are you trying to say?
[33:55] I heard that your daughter has an affair with someone and her in laws threw her out.
[34:14] Tell me clearly. What are you trying to say Nusrat aunty?!
[34:23] Maheen.. you go dear. I'm talking to her. Go..
[34:32] Who told you this Nusrat?
[34:38] Sarwat, everybody knows and,
[34:42] Sarwat, such things don't stay hidden.
[34:45] I didn't believe my ears thats why I came to ask you.
[35:00] Aunty, are you here to ask or inquire?
[35:12] Go away Maheen. I'm talking. You go.
[35:16] She's weird. She'll say anything in front of anyone.
[35:19] Take her inside..
[35:23] Sarwat, your daughter got angry without a reason.
[35:27] I know your daughters since they were children. I didn't trust anyone.
[35:37] Yes, they grew up in front of you. All my daughter.
[35:43] In front of your eyes. If they have been like this.. Zara,
[35:48] she is the simplest in all my daughters.
[35:52] You'd know if she was like that. We ourselves don't know what happened.
[36:00] We just got a call from her in laws that we should come and get her.
[36:06] We ran like crazy people and when we saw our daughter's condition there..
[36:16] What can I tell you? I swear I don't understand. Who planned all this?
[36:26] If they wanted to throw out our daughter, they could have told us.
[36:33] Who did she have there? She lost her husband long ago. She had a child..
[36:40] You're right. People are something on the inside and something else on the outside..
[36:54] Why did you have to talk to strangers about our family?
[36:57] Why shouldn't I? God knows what she'll tell people to get their sympathy.
[37:04] She has nothing else. We have taken everything.
Oh well..
[37:11] What will you do with this house?
[37:14] I don't know. I'll rent it out.
[37:18] Its my son's memoir. I'll not let you give it to someone.
[37:22] Empty houses attract paranormal creatures. Its good someone will live there.
[37:28] And we'll get money as well.
I don't need any money.
[37:32] I'll keep them. As it is, its my house. I'll do whatever I please.
[37:37] Whatever you're happy after taking..
[37:41] It was my property that I gifted to Adeel
[37:45] and I'll not let anybody take over it.
[37:50] Adeel named that house to Zara and Zara will always have a right on it. Understand?
[37:58] Whats your problem, dad?
[37:59] Why do you keep chanting Zara? She has left. Why do you keep taking her name?
[38:05] Mahi!
[38:06] How are you talking to your dad?
[38:09] No. Let her speak. Let her.
[38:13] Dad I'm just saying that Zara has left this house now and you do know what she did.
[38:22] You two will believe what you saw but I won't.
[38:28] My heart still says it was all a lie.
[38:33] Who was that boy? Who planned it? The day I find out.. I'll not forgive anyone.
[38:43] Why would someone plan? Who would have such animosity against Zara?
[38:48] Hmm. This is what I'm thinking.
[38:52] Who took out their animosity and why?
[38:58] Enough. I think. You keep taking Zara's name in this house throughout the day.
[39:05] I don't want to hear her name in this house anymore.
[39:09] And you listen to me. If you take her name again, you'll see the worse of me.
[39:14] You should stop it too, Farida.
[39:17] Stop it. Its enough. Let her be.
[39:22] You took matters of the house outside.
[39:26]  Be afraid of the time will the stains of this ridicule will reach your own daughters.
[39:33] God's justice is silent. Remember this...
