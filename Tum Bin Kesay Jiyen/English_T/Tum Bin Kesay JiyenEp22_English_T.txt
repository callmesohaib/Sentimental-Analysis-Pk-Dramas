[00:21] Your father has told Zara everything. 
[00:24] He has asked them not to leave home 
[00:28] and that he will be introducing his friend to Zara.
[00:32] how can I convince him for the proposal?
[00:35]  Why not?
[00:37] I almost forgot that Mahi isn't your sister that you should try for.
[00:45] The way you tried for Saad and Zaini to get engaged. 
[00:49] but Mirha got into an accident. Your issue came on her head. I am telling you to go some other time
[00:55] She'll die. I've seen her funeral in my dream
[00:58] her funeral, why don't you get it?
I will go for sure...
[01:01] I promised Zara, so I will go for sure
[01:05] I will go at any cost, no matter what happens
[01:08] Even if I die! 
[01:17] oh well brother, at least you came to our house by any means
[01:22] Saad made me talk to Zara, I had talked to her yesterday
[01:26] all praise to God, she was so happy
[01:29] sister, its just that our daughters shall stay happy in their in-laws house. What else does parents want
[01:34] Amen

[01:42] thank you brother, it seems today is 10th
[01:47] yes, today is 10th
[01:49] its been so long brother, but you have never delayed it for even a single day
[01:54] their father also used to give me the monthly amount on the 10th of every month
[01:59] this was his principle.
 At the time of starting our business, brother Farooq said
[02:05] that besides us, even the employees will be paid on the 10th of every month
[02:08] I am grateful to you, brother
[02:11] nowadays people don't even ask alive people, yet you are fulfilling the friendship of your dead friend
[02:18] sister, see I don't come to your house because you say such things
[02:21] I am not doing any favor, I am juts fulfilling my duty. That's it!

[11:09] Mr. Ahmed, they have gone
[11:13] but I am telling you, today I am feeling very anxious
[11:17] call the kids from the madarssa, I want to keep a religious gathering
[11:21] I swear, I am feeling very anxious
[11:24] how many times I have told you, don't talk non-sense
[11:30] explain your mother, Maheen
[11:32] both of them have left for their journey, we shall pray at this time
[11:37] and here she talks rubbish!
[11:45] I pray that she dies, and shall never come back
[11:49] and I shall get rid of her
[12:05] What happened?
[12:06] your mood is quite off
[12:08] you don't seem happy
[12:11] nobody was happy, Adeel
[12:16] not even you?
[12:19] it had never happened like this with me
[12:23] my mother always blesses me with her prayers whenever I leave from home
[12:29] and aunt had just blessed you
[12:33] not me
[12:36] I am just missing my mom
[12:39] just a small matter?
Come here
[12:42] let me recite & bless you
[12:46] Adeel!
[12:58] they must have told you that when they are coming back
[13:00] Who?
[13:03] I am talking about our son, whom else I will ask about? Who else had gone from this house?
[13:08] they haven't reached to the airport as of yet & here you are talking about their arrival
[13:14] I've just asked a general question. What's the problem in answering?
[13:17] the problem is that, I would have told you if I would have known the date
[13:24] well... your daughter-in-law loves to do everything as per her choice
[13:30] she will come whenever she feels like
[13:34] Once I had read a book
[13:37] it was written that, elders stops the small kids to play in the sand because
[13:43] they feel like playing with the sand themselves
[13:47] even you had tried a lot that Adeel & Zara shall not go on the honeymoon
[13:54] what if you also feel like.. 
[13:57] I hate this habit of yours!
[13:59] joking around at all times
[14:04] you are always joking with Zara as well
[14:08] you'll see, one day your daughter-in-law will dance on our heads because of your antics
[14:16] your son is married now, have some sense
[14:20] be a bit sober, joking at all times is not good
[14:24] I've learnt only one thing in my life
[14:26] whichever days you pass happily are good
[14:31] nobody can trust life
[14:33] it depends if we breathe back or not, else everything is finished
[14:38] anyways... if you talk to them then tell them to come back within a week
[14:48] they can spend the rest of their honeymoon at Edhi centre
[14:56] what else?
[14:58] they had celebrated their wedding reception on the roads & orphanages
[15:03] I haven't said anything strange
[15:11] don't know what is this woman's problem!
[15:21] she makes such a sweet tea although her tongue is way too bitter
[15:26] Mahi... Mahi dear, bring me another cup of tea
[15:32] your mother has poured an entire truck of sugar in it
[15:36] hmm... 
[15:39] Ok today is the problem
[15:41] but when will you introduce me to that robber?
[15:44] he isn't a robber, sister
[15:46] Ok he is not a robber, so lets call him the spy of robbers. When are you going to introduce him?
[15:51] why do you want to meet him?
[15:53] I want to meet him, that's enough. 
Why & for what, you cannot ask that
[15:59] and listen, why had fallen for such a guy that you are feeling ashamed to introduce him to your family?
[16:04] you will insult him that's why I am not letting you meet him
[16:07] No dear, why will I insult him?
[16:11] first, I will see him
[16:13] I will see, whether he is capable to be insulted or not
[16:17] what if he doesn't have any respect to be insulted
[16:20] See! I am not introducing him to you because of your such words
[16:24] you have started to insult him right away
[16:28] are you refusing?
yes
[16:30] and do you think that I will introduce him to you after such discussion?
[16:33] do whatever you want to do
[16:35] you want to check the CCTV, or provoke our parents. Do whatever you want to
[16:40] I am also your sister, I will face everything myself
[16:44] but I won't let you meet him
[16:47] honestly Mirha, you've proved that you are my sister
[16:53] but I will decide that how much younger you are from me
[17:02] this is his number, right?
[17:06] yes?
[17:08] speak up
[17:16] when will you introduce him?
[17:18] what is your problem, sister?
[17:20] my problem is really big
[18:36] Zara... 
[18:38] where is Zara?
Maheen, go call her
[18:41] mom, what's wrong? Why Zara will be here? She is at her house
[18:48] yes! it had slipped out of my mind. Call her, make me speak to her
[18:54] mom, have you seen the time? She must be in her flight at this hour
[18:59] yes... may God keep everything fine
[19:03] don't know why I am feeling so anxious
[19:06] I couldn't offer the prayers as well
[19:08] it felt as if Zara is calling me again & again
[19:14] mom, she is in the flight right now. She had said that she'll call us as soon as the flight lands
[19:21] Ok
[19:22] by the way, until what time she'll reach?
[19:25] its quite weird mom. You are in a hurry to oust the one who is at home
[19:30] and the one who had gone, you are in a hurry to call her back
[19:33] God forbid, why do I have to call her back?
[19:35] its just that...
[19:38] I am feeling a bit anxious
[19:40] don't know what's happening. Give me some water
[19:43] Mom, what do you do? You are spreading tension for no reason. There isn't any such thing
[19:48] you are getting worried & making me worried for no reason
[19:52] you always keep thinking about something or the other, Here you go
[20:16] Dolly
[20:17] yes?
[20:18] dear, I was thinking about my quilts that are kept in the storeroom. They are brand new
[20:24] take them out, I will put them in the sunlight
[20:27] and do one thing, get them a cover of your choice
[20:32] why mom? They are so old & dirty. What needs to be done with them?
[20:37] I will give you on your wedding in dowry, what else?
[20:40] oh mom, what's wrong? Who gives quilt nowadays in dowry?
[20:46] I don't want, even your were kept as it is. Its not required
[20:50] then you shall also keep them safely
[20:53] do you know, when I got married. At that time, a dowry used to be called precious due to mattress & quilts
[20:59] and my mother! She had gifted me 3 quilts, that too of brokett
[21:04] mom, earlier times were different. Nowadays its not trendy
[21:09] as it is, brother Saad will get married first. Lets see what Zaini brings, we'll keep something like that
[21:17] what are you saying?
[21:19] why are you doing this, dear?
[21:24] mom, they don't consider us anything
[21:27] there is no need to do so much
[21:30] they don't consider us anything?
[21:32] oh dear, nobody has ever considered us anything except for them
[21:37] and the way this house runs, its because of brother Manzoor's money
[21:42] which he gives us every month, besides we never had to mention him
[21:49] dad had a partnership with Manzoor uncle
[21:52] why he won't give us the money? Its our share, he isn't doing any favor
[21:56] he did a favor
[21:58] and he always does
[22:00] and now you don't be ungrateful!
[22:03] our relatives were waiting for your father's death
[22:07] if brother Manzoor hadn't been there, then don't know in what condition we must be
[22:12] stop it mom, I will take out your quilts then you can give me
[22:17] I have heard these stories many times, I can tell you word by word too
[22:23] don't worry, I will remember everything
[22:25] whatever everyone did earlier & what they are doing now. I won't forget anything
[22:30] what is he doing? tell me
[22:33] he insulted us, can't you see mom?
[22:37] or only I've gone mad?
[22:41] they make us realize about our inferiority
[22:43] they don't consider us compatible to them, mom
[22:46] why can't you feel, it seems as if you are blind folded
[22:50] now you'll say, "no dear, there isn't any such thing"
leave it, mom!
[22:54] I have to go in that house, why will you care?
[23:07] please tell me where is my son right now. Is he fine, is he alright?
[23:11] yes, he is fine but right now he is in the hospital. He had an accident
[23:16] Accident! Where did it happen, & how?
[23:19] Is my son fine? Did he got hurt?
[23:34] hello!
