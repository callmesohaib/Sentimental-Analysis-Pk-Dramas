[00:13] Saad, I am not in a hurry to get married.
[00:15] I only shared my opinion. I will get married whenever my dad and family will want
[00:21] I am not in a hurry to get married.
[00:23] I don't know why Zara is continuously calling him. He told me that she called him yesterday as well.
[00:28] She said that if I can talk to my parents despite being a girl then why can't you talk to your parents since you are a boy
[00:34] I don't know why is she in so much hurry.
[00:36] Let's discuss about marriage. Right?
[00:38] So tell us brother
[00:41] What is the order of your daughter?
[00:44] Which date has been fixed by her for her marriage?
[00:47] What's this nonsense Farida?
[00:50] What kind of discussion is this?
[01:25] Zara, crying like this won't solve any problem.
[01:31] Everyone is trying to tell you this thing. 
[01:34] That house is not suitable for you.
[01:38] Brother Adeel is a very nice person. No one says anything to him. 
[01:42] You should talk to him once.
[01:45] And he should realize that the reason behind his shifting to Karachi is his mom and sister.
[01:54] Do you know, what was discussed there?
[01:57] Why are you hiding that from me?
[02:00] Tell me, what did they say to dad?
[02:03] I don't know anything.
[02:05] And everything is in front of you.
[02:08] Haven't you realized yet?
[02:10] Whatever has happened there is not right Zara.
[02:18] Listen, dad has come back from hospital so stop crying. Please Zara.
[02:46] What happened?
[02:47] Nothing has happened. I think there is some problem downstairs. Let's go there.
[02:53] You scared me. Nothing must have happened there.
[02:56] What happened?
All the lights of house are switched on.
[02:59]  I doubt that something is wrong.
[03:02] Oh God. Maybe sister-in-law forgot to switch off lights.
[03:06] I think, brother Manzoor has come back.
[03:08] How can he come back from Zara's in-laws' house so soon. 
[03:11] Something is wrong. Let's go there.
Adnan
[03:15] Where would brother Manzoor go if he wouldn't come back to his house? It's the limit.
[03:18] But how can he come back so soon. Let's go.
Don't interfere in others' matters.
[03:22] Go to sleep. We will go there tomorrow.
[03:25] Mind your own business.
[03:28] Oh, you spoiled my sleep.
[03:38] Let's leave the room and let dad take rest.
[03:44] OK uncle, I am leaving as well.
OK my son.
[03:49] Don't mention this thing in your house about what was happened there.
[03:56] Right uncle.
[03:58] Thank you so much Saad my son.
[04:00] We reached hospital on time only because of you otherwise...
[04:03] What are you talking about?
[04:09] OK, I am leaving now. Good bye.
Thanks my son
[04:25] Where is Zara?
She is here.
[04:41] Where are you going?
[04:44] I want to meet dad.
[04:46] Let him take rest. Meet him later.
[04:50] I want to see him.
[04:53] Zara, what you wanted to do with him, you have done that. Now, let him take rest.
[04:59] What is my fault? Why are you blaming me?
[05:03] I don't even know that what was discussed there. Saad.
[05:07] Saad, make her understand.
[05:09] I am not her enemy. I am saying this for her betterment. 
[05:13] Maybe she understands your point.
[05:18] Maheen is right. Dad needs to take rest now.
[05:24] But Saad.
[05:25] I will bring tea. You talk to each other.
Yes please.
[05:34] Come with me.
But.
[05:35] Come with me.
[05:44] Hello, I have just come back after offering Fajar prayer.
[05:48] Someone has told me that God accepts prayers after obligatory prayers.
[05:52] Really?
[05:53] So tell me, what did you pray for me?
[05:57] It's not good to tell others before our prayers get accepted 
[06:00] and especially to that person for whom we pray in front of God.
[06:03] Aqib, I am very tensed because of one thing.
[06:06] I have lost my phone and all of my data.
[06:10] And there were so many pictures of both you and me.
So what?
[06:13] Why are you so scared?
What do you mean?
[06:16] What if that person viral our pictures then?
There won't be any such thing.
[06:23] Those were just normal pictures.
[06:25] To go viral, pictures must be weird.
[06:29] I am serious Aqib. I am really tensed. What do you mean by that?
[06:34] Yes, if we file a complain in police then they can find your phone.
[06:38] There are so many crimes in Hyderabad. 
[06:41] Will police start to find my phone by leaving their other tasks.
[06:44] If police gets money then not only your phone they can find even a small needle.
[06:49] If I had that much money then I would have found your phone.
[06:54] And then all your worry would end and mine as well.
[06:57] OK, tell me, how much money is required.
[07:01] Mirha, now you are embarrassing me.
[07:03] As I said that if I had that much money then I would have found your phone.
[07:09] But I will try my best.
[07:11] Aqib tell me if you can do anything otherwise I will do something.
[07:16] I am really tensed about it. Do something.
[07:19] And as you know that my elder sister already doubts both of us.
[07:24] That's right Mirha but I want to arrange that money myself.
[07:27] Tell me, how much money is required.
[07:30] Mirha, let me try myself.
[07:33] Aqib tell me, how much amount is required.
[07:37] I want to get my mobile back at any cost. Don't worry about money.
[07:42] OK Mirha, promise me first that 
[07:44] as soon as I will arrange that money, you will take that money back from me.
[07:48] Aqib.
Please, promise me.
[07:50] Do you know, I have already talked to them.
[07:53] OK fine. I promise. Now tell me how much amount is required.
[07:58] Well, I think your phone's cost was around fifty to sixty thousand. Right?
[08:02] So approximately half of that amount will be required i.e. twenty five to thirty thousand rupees.
[08:06] Twenty five to thirty thousand. That's too much.
Yes it is.
[08:11] I also said that but they are not agreeing.
[08:14] And this much amount is needed.
[08:16] But if you don't have that much money then just leave.
[08:19] Let me do something.
[08:20] Let me ask brother Adeel to give me that amount. He will give me. He won't ask any question.
[08:28] I will tell you if anything happens.
OK, tell me about your foot.
[08:34] It's fine.
[08:37] OK, Good bye.
[08:51] Saad, there is no such thing.
[08:55] Everyone is trying to tell you this.
[08:59] You should talk to Adeel. He is responsible to manage everything for you.
[09:15] That's why I don't tell you anything
[09:17]  because you start to cry instead of finding any solution to that problem.
[09:34] OK, stop crying.
[09:37] As you know that I can't see tears in your eyes. It hurts me.
[10:13] Take tea.
[10:23] Dad is very worried for you.
[10:28] Has he slept
[10:32] No, he is awake.
[10:37] So why didn't Maheen allow me to meet him?
[10:44] I don't know.
[10:50] Saad take tea.
[10:56] Zara
[10:59] Where are you going?
[11:02] I am going to meet dad.
[11:32] Forgive me Mr. Manzoor that my brother's family misbehaved with you.
[11:39] It's OK.
[11:41] Don't mention it again.
[11:44] And I don't want you to talk to brother Ahmed about this matter.
Why?
[11:51] Why wouldn't I talk to him? It's not a minor thing. 
[11:54] When Zara will go there after marriage then they will do the same with her.
[11:59] I am saying this because of Zara that don't talk to him.
[12:03] She is our daughter and we can't compete against groom's family.
[12:13] If we will keep quiet now then how will we stand with Zara in future?
[12:18] I asked you to take me with you.
[12:21]  If I was there then I would have talked to my brother.
[12:24] That would be a different story.
[12:26] Brother Ahmed was so worried.
[12:33] And he apologized as well.
[12:37] Both those women ruined my brother's life.
[12:42] And they will do the same thing to my Zara, I was not afraid without any reason.
[12:47] Sarwat.
[12:50] I have complete faith in Zara.
[12:57] When she has said that she will handle the situation then she will do that.
[13:03] Why don't you try to understand.
[13:07] Zara wants to spend her life with Adeel in any case.
[13:12] And I kept myself quiet because of her happiness.
[13:16] No matter if they humiliate us.
[13:19] If you are compromising because of Zara then why didn't sister Farida keep quiet because of Adeel.
[13:28] Mr. Manzoor, I am telling you that you are considering Zara's happiness but she can't live happily there.
[13:37] Listen, I am her father.
[13:42] And it's my duty to take care of her happiness.
[13:47] But if I will give priority to myself then things will get worse.
[13:54] I am not that selfish and egoistic that I don't allow my daughter to live happily.
[14:01] Only because of this reason that her mother-in-law and sister-in-law have humiliated me.
[14:10] And what will your daughter do to prevent her father's honor?
[14:15] Isn't there any obligation on her? Why can't she see her father's insult?
[14:22] You won't discuss anything with Zara.
[14:27] If you ask a single question from Zara then no one would be worse than me. Remember that.
[14:44] Why don't you understand?
[14:49] If Zara leaves this house after her marriage or
[14:53]  if God forbid any mishap happens then in both cases we will be humiliated.
[15:01] And why do you forget?
[15:04] She is married to Adeel, it's not an engagement.
[15:08] That we give back ring and break engagement.
[15:16] Don't worry.
[15:20] God will make everything better.
[16:08] And what will your daughter do to protect her father's honor?
[16:13] Isn't there any obligation on her? Why can't she see her father's humiliation?
[16:58] Hello.
[17:04] What happened Zara? Are you crying?
[17:11] What's the matter Zara? Tell me, what happened?
[17:15] Don't you know?
No, I don't know.
[17:20] OK please stop crying and tell me what happened?
[17:25] I have made a mistake Adeel.
[17:28] I shouldn't have made that promise with you.
[17:32] You told me
[17:34] Both of us promised with each other that we will never fight with each other because of anyone else.
[17:41] We will never raise questions in front of each other.
[17:44] Yes, I said that and I promised you but
[17:47] What happened? Which mistake are you talking about?
[17:50] I shouldn't have made that promise with you.
[17:54] Zara. Relax.
[17:57] Tell me what happened? Has anyone said something to you?
[18:00] Adeel there would be no problem if they had said anything to me.
[18:03] Aunt Farida and Mahi humiliated dad so much that he has come back home.
[18:09] When did it happen?
[18:11] And why didn't anyone tell me about it? I don't know anything about it.
[18:14] And you didn't tell me as well.
What would you do Adeel if I told you?
[18:19] You couldn't do anything.
[18:24] Maheen is right.
[18:27] Zenny, mom and Saad, everyone is right.
[18:32] But I couldn't understand.
[18:37] We can't get married Adeel.
[18:40] Zara, what are you talking about? Are you in your senses?
[18:44] Your family members hate me so how can we get married and if we married even then...
[18:49] Then..
[18:50] What do you mean by that?
[18:53] That won't remain in tact.
[18:56] That will break or will be broken forcefully.
[18:59] Whatever aunt Farida has done to dad, she didn't do that because of him
[19:04]  instead she has done that because of me.
[19:06] And she will do that again and again.
[19:14] Have you remembered Adeel, I told you
[19:19] That to me the most important thing in this world is my dad's honor.
[19:29] That's why I have made my decision that I won't marry you.
[19:39] Please forgive me Adeel.
[19:41] Zara listen to me. Hello.
[20:37] Stop this illiterate mindset.
[20:39] Adeel, you are calling mom an illiterate because of your mother-in-law.
[20:44] You are giving priority to your in-laws in front of your own family.
[20:49] Don't extract wrong meanings of my words.
[20:52] Is it necessary to create fuss in every matter?
I will create fuss now.
[20:56] Why were you quiet at that time when dad was giving divorce threat to mom because of Zara?
[21:01] Now the fuss will be created.
[21:09] Saad. Saad.
[21:14] Where are you going early morning?
[21:17] I am going to home.
[21:19] You are going to home. At this time you come back home. Is everything alright?
[21:23] Do you want me to do anything for you or do I go home?
[21:26] No, I just want to have a chat with you. Come.
[21:30] Brother Adnan, I am very tired.
[21:32] I want to take rest.
[21:34] Well, you went to Zara's in-laws' house.
[21:37] To fix your friend's marriage.
[21:40] But what happened? Didn't they refuse?
[21:45] Brother Adnan.
[21:47] You are my elder so I respect you.
[21:51] But think before you say something.
[21:53] What if someone listens?
Who will listen, is anyone here?
[21:59] There is no one here except you and me.
[22:02] You look so tired. Tell me what happened?
[22:06] It would be better for you to get that information yourself.
[22:19] I will get that information.
[23:32] How is it?
Very beautiful.
[23:37] Now it is looking more beautiful.
[24:18] Look, you love Zara so much and when she will go to Hyderabad after her marriage then you will feel bad about that. Right?
[24:25] And I know that you have a very good friendship and love. I heard your conversation candidly.
[24:55] You went to Zara's in-law's house. To fix your friend's marriage.
[25:00] But what happened? Didn't they refuse?
[25:09] Mom I didn't expect this from you.
[25:12] At least you should have cared that they are not only our relatives but my in-laws as well.
[25:15] Which relatives and which in-laws.
[25:18] Go to hell such relatives
[25:21] They have already controlled both you and your father. 
[25:25] They have done some magic on you.
[25:27] For God's sake mom. Please.
[25:30] Stop such illiterate mindset.
Adeel.
[25:33] You are calling mom an illiterate because of your mother-in-law.
[25:36] You are giving priority to your in-laws in front of your own family.
[25:41] Don't extract wrong meanings of my words.
[25:44] Is it necessary to create a fuss in every matter?
I will create fuss now.
[25:48] Why did you kept yourself quiet when dad was giving divorce threat to mom because of Zara?
[25:54] The fuss will be created now.
[25:56] And listen to me.
[25:57] Didn't you ask your father-in-law.
[25:59] He only told you selected things about mom.
[26:03] You should ask him. I was sitting there with mom as a witness. She didn't say anything.
[26:09] And if I said anything then what's wrong with that? Tell me.
[26:17] Ask them to come here in front of me. Let me talk to them.
[26:22] Why don't you understand that girls of our family don't discuss matters of their marriage?
[26:28] And neither parents of girls visit groom's house to fix marriage date.
[26:33] I said that so what's wrong with it and what's lie in it?
Yes.
[26:40] The girls of our family don't discuss about their marriage.
[26:43] They discuss about divorce.
[26:49] In our family parents don't go to fix daughter's marriage 
[26:53] but they go to court to obtain divorce for their daughters.
[27:03] He taunted me.
[27:07] He has taunted me mom.
[27:10] It's OK then
[27:12] Now you will also give divorce to her.
[27:16] Just like your father has threatened me to give divorce because of his daughter-in-law
[27:20] In the same way you should also make a decision
[27:22]  and tell me about your choice between your mother and your wife.
[27:28] What happened Adeel?
[27:30] Tell us.
[27:32] You are so talkative but why are you quiet now.
[27:48] Adeel, come to my room.
[28:05] Go and make plans with your father.
[28:09] But tell me about your decision when you come back.
[28:26] Mom, I forbade you that don't discuss that matter but why did you do that?
[28:31] Don't teach me. I know very well that what I have to do.
[28:36] You don't know anything.
[28:44] Everyone is doing what he wants.
[29:31] Dad
[29:41] Dad, I am really sorry. Please forgive me.
No my child.
[29:49] You haven't done anything.
[29:51] So much bad happened to you because of me. Sorry dad.
[29:58] That didn't happen because of you.
[30:02] What has to happen, happens.
[30:06] Don't blame yourself. That was not your fault.
[30:18] Did you talk to Adeel?
[30:23] Yes.
[30:25] When will he come?
[30:28] Did he say that?
[30:31] Yes
[30:34] You are saying as if you don't know anything.
[30:41] He also told me what you have said to him.
[30:51] He is very worried. He is a sensible boy.
[30:58] He will handle the situation.
[31:01] I am happy that you have chosen a good life partner for yourself.
[31:14] Don't take such minor things seriously my child.
[31:19] Be happy.
[31:22] Your life will pass in a good way.
[31:25] Hmm?
[31:30] Are you feeling better now?
[31:34] Chill.
[31:55] This is not a minor thing Zara that you can ignore it. 
[31:59] Dad is saying this because he loves you.
[32:02] OK, don't ask about his humiliation.
[32:05] Let's forget what they did to dad.
[32:09] But why don't you understand that they won't keep you happy.
[32:15] And what will you do if Adeel will start to favor his mother and sister in future?
[32:22] But let brother come here once.
[32:25] How can we make any decision without talking to him.
[32:29] He is coming alone here. Do you understand this situation?
[32:34] I have forbidden Adeel to come here.
[32:38] You have forbidden brother Adeel to come here.
[32:43] No.
[32:45] From marrying to him.
[32:47] What?
[32:49] What are you talking about? 
[32:51] You refused to get married to him. Are you in your senses?
[32:57] So it means that he is coming here to appease you 
[33:00] but you won't get convinced because you are not an easy target for him at all.
[33:04] And they should have realized that their forceful behavior with you won't be tolerated at all.
[33:15] Zara listen to me.
[33:17] You listen to me. She is absolutely right. Don't stop her.
[33:21] In-laws house is like a forest. Do you know?
[33:23] And in that forest only those animals can survive who are strong and who can fight for their lives.
[33:29] But for that it is necessary to be an animal.
[33:33] And neither Zara nor brother Adeel is any animal.
[33:45] Get well soon. Won't you dance in your brother's wedding?
[33:50] Brother, if I will dance in your wedding then mom will break my leg again.
[33:56] By the way brother, I don't like that you are going alone.
[34:00] If I was alright then I would have gone with you.
[34:04] I have to go alone
[34:07] Those children whose parents only create fuss. 
[34:11] They know how to handle that situation.
[34:14] Don't worry about me, I will handle that situation. Just take care of yourself.
[34:19] Brother, I need some cash.
[34:23] How much?
[34:25] Twenty five thousand.
[34:28] Twenty five thousand?
[34:30] Why do you need that much money?
[34:32] Oh so you will ask questions before giving me money now?
[34:35] This never happened before brother Adeel.
[34:37] There is no such thing. I am just asking that why do you need that much money? 
[34:41] Is there any problem?
[34:42] Just leave it. Mom is right.
[34:44] You haven't married yet but your behavior has changed.
[34:48] Sister Zara has controlled you.
[34:51] Stop it. Now you are saying the same thing.
[34:56] OK, I have ten thousand.
[35:03] Keep it, I will give you remaining amount later.
[35:05] No brother, I need complete amount right now.
[35:08] If you won't give me that amount then I will say the same thing again.
[35:12] Well, my only brother is being controlled by my sister-in-law Zara.
[35:15] OK keep it. I will give you remaining amount. Take it.
[35:27] Here is your complete twenty five thousand. Take it.
[35:32] Are you happy now?
Thank you.
[35:36] OK take care of yourself. I am getting late for the office. I have to go.
[35:40] Good bye.
[35:50] Now tell me, what will you do?
[35:53] He is going to his in-laws' house.
[35:55] He will go there and apologize to them.
[35:59] And they will forgive him.
[36:01] What will you do?
[36:04] Adeel has already told you about his decision.
[36:07] You asked him to chose between mom and wife
[36:11] So he has responded you.
[36:14] He doesn't need you mom.
OK, OK.
[36:18] I don't care for anyone. He can do whatever he wants.
[36:21] You should take care of him.
[36:24] Why are you showing your stubbornness.
[36:26] You it very well that Adeel won't leave Zara at any cost.
[36:30] It's OK then. He should leave his mom.
[36:34] I won't agree. I am telling you.
[36:38] Why don't you understand such a minor thing?
[36:41] Your son has left you and informed you about his decision.
[36:45] Mom use your brain.
[36:48] How can you spare that girl because of whom your son has left you?
[36:53] You won't spare Zara. You have to bring her here after her marriage.
[36:58] Then you will take your revenge.
[37:01] Are you getting my point?
[37:07] You start to cry, I don't understand why?
[37:12] Stop crying now.
