[00:15] Saad has been coming here since his childhood. 
[00:19] At that time, no one even knew that he will be engaged with Zenny
[00:22] Oh yes. 
[00:26] Everyone was so surprised on this engagement.
[00:30] Even I also thought that he will be engaged with you.
[00:34] Our house has been robbed and they took everything.
[00:39] What do you mean? 
[00:41] Are you and Mirha alright?
[00:46] Last time Adeel and Mahi came here then Mirha got accident 
[00:50] and this time our house has been robbed.
[00:54] God forbid, whose evil sight is effecting my house.
[01:15] come on guys
[01:18] pick up your share
[01:20] and enjoy
[01:21] have you distributed evenly?
[01:24] hey Aqib
[01:26] that girl's elder sister seems quite sly to me
[01:29] for sure she'll file a complaint to the police. Just handle it
[01:34] and yes, wasn't there any cameras or so in that house?
[01:36] are you guys mad?
[01:39] will I send you guys inside a house where there are cameras? Are you guys crazy!
[01:42] I am just telling you, the girls elder sister seems quite clever to me
[01:46] just check, what if she files a complain then we'll be caught
[01:50] and what I have told you guys? Let Mirha's phone be with her
[01:54] at least I would be getting information
[01:56] he was hurrying
[01:58] and what's the big deal if we would have got any information? As if you uncle would have saved us
[02:02] come on, drink your tea
[02:05] you guys don't remember anything
[02:06] we have got ample money though
[02:09] give your money to me
[02:11] now its not that much that I shall give it to you
[02:13] now don't leave your house for a few days
[02:16] or just move to some other area, got it?
[02:19] where shall we move to, brother? Nothing happens
[02:22] dear, tell me where does it hurt
here?
[02:25] here?
yes
[02:27] yes, over here
[02:29] over here
yes
[02:31] doctor, I hope nothing is serious
[02:34] No, nothing is serious
[02:36] actually she got injured once again at the same place where she already had an injury
[02:40] but the wound is safe due to the plaster
[02:44] I am writing a few medicines
[02:47] you need to give it to her on time
[02:53] bring her to my clinic tomorrow, her proper check up is very important
[02:57] please come doctor, let me see you off
[02:59] Ok
[03:02] okay take care
[03:10] what is this new drama?
[03:12] what was the need to call the doctor here?
[03:15] what do you think? Won't I ask you the reality if you'll do this drama?
[03:18] Mahi, I am not doing any drama. Its really hurting
[03:22] stop your rubbish!
[03:25] whatever you have done with us, its the consequences of that
[03:28] now bear it, stay here alone!
[03:31] Mahi... 
[03:47] Zara
[03:50] why are you getting so worried?
[03:56] you are crying
[03:59] look, see me off happily
[04:02] next time I have to come as a groom as well
[04:08] in God's protection
[04:12] again you are getting worried
[04:14] why are you being so superstitious?
[04:17] everyone gets, Adeel
[04:21] no
[04:23] everyone doesn't
[04:27] everyone does for the sake of their own love
[04:30] the people whom we love, we don't want them to face any problem or so
[04:35] its just... 
[04:37] I am afraid
[04:42] Zara
[04:44] mom was enough for this
[05:01] God will protect you
[05:04] mom prays for me & I pray for you
[05:10] aunt had said quite a lot of weird words
[05:16] mom says, it keeps us out of trouble
[05:20] problems run away and... 
[05:23] evil eye stays off
[05:30] don't you worry, everything will be fine
[05:35] Adeel
[05:38] please take care of yourself
[05:40] you too
[05:44] I will come back soon
[05:51] now don't cry, ok?
[06:08] don't you know that I didn't mean it?
[06:11] don't you know about your mother at all?
[06:15] then don't speak to me in poetry
[06:17] so that I don't understand
[06:20] you should have asked me clearly to leave this house
[06:26] again the same thing, Maheen
[06:29] do you understand anything or not? Or do you only understand whatever you feel like?
[06:36] don't annoy your mother this way, I am already so worried
[06:40] then why are you here to appease me if you are worried?
[06:44] don't come, go away. Let me be
[06:47] there is no need to appease me
[06:50] I haven't come to appease you but to inform you that your husband had called
[06:55] what!
[06:57] he had called, why?
[06:59] I don't know, he had a word with your father. He will come to meet him
[07:04] let him come if he wants to, but I am not going anywhere
[07:08] your father will decide that
[07:11] why? Why father will decide, mom?
[07:14] why father will make the decision of my life?
[07:16] you are lucky, be thankful to God that you have a father
[07:22] who can clear the mess you have made
[07:25] mom!
[07:28] come, lets have dinner. Even I haven't eaten because of you
[07:58] move your scarf!
[08:00] Mahi
[08:03] please sit, I want to talk to you about something
[08:07] speak up
[08:08] will you ask brother Adeel to check our neighbor's cameras
[08:12] why?
[08:14] you don't want it?
[08:17] Mirha, tell me the complete matter
[08:19] why you don't want us to check our alley's cameras recording?
[08:23] his name is Aqib
[08:27] whose?
[08:29] whose name is Aqib?
[08:31] I went to meet him at the door
[08:33] Wow! I already had a doubt on you
[08:36] I had gone to meet him at the door, but he wasn't there
[08:40] and those robbers entered as soon as I had opened the door
[08:45] was he among those guys? Is he a robber?
[08:48] No no Mahi, he wasn't there
[08:51] oh! So he is the same guy with whom you had an accident on the bike
[08:55] No Mahi, I was standing on the road and...
enough!
[08:59] stop your rubbish! I have heard your false story many times
[09:03] please don't tell anyone, not even mom or dad
[09:08] I won't
[09:11] also you'll ask brother Adeel not to check the recordings
[09:15] I will check that myself
[09:17] why?
[09:18] there is no answer of every why, dear
[09:21] anyways, when will you make me meet Mr. Aqib?
[09:25] you?
[09:26] yes me
[09:28] make me meet him quickly, else I won't meet him
[09:32] are you getting me?
[10:00] you shouldn't have given such an early date
[10:03] how we'll do the preparations so quickly?
[10:07] its alright, if God wills everything will be done. One shouldn't delay good deed
[10:12] Ok do call Ali in the morning, he wanted to talk to you
[10:16] okay
[10:17] when did he call?
[10:19] he had called in the afternoon, but you weren't at home
[10:23] did you tell him about Zara's wedding?
[10:26] I did, he was so happy
[10:28] hmm... ok fine
[10:30] do you know, even I am having doubts in my heart since Maheen has talked about it
[10:36] I am afraid
[10:38] have you seen sister-in-law's face?
[10:41] she is not happy. She is just pretending to be happy
[10:46] a taunt pinches, even if you do it while smiling
[10:51] I am afraid
[10:53] has she been happy ever on anything, that you are worried about her?
[10:57] leave her
[11:00] if Adeel is fine, then all is fine
[11:05] ok tomorrow morning I will bring some amount from the bank
[11:08] then get the girls start working, so that all the matters shall be sorted quickly
[11:14] do you know, what answer Zara gave me when I had talked to her?
[11:20] She talked about you & me
[11:23] She said. Dad, the way you have supported mom the same way Adeel supports me too
[11:30] and then you had told her that if you see the resemblance of your father in your husband
[11:36] then your love increases way too much
[11:39] and a love teaches tolerance & patience
[11:45] don't worry about Zara. God will make everything better
[11:50] Ameen
[11:51] Okay, this is done. Tomorrow morning I will bring you the money
[11:56] then start all the preparations
[11:58] Okay fine
[12:12] oh God, we are destroyed & ruined
[12:15] the robbers took away everything. God! everything has happened because of that wretched girl!
[12:20] mom, mom.. why are you ruining the matters?
[12:23] be quiet
[12:24] dear Mahi, take your mother to her room. It seems that she has completely lost her senses
[12:30] you are right, lets go
[12:31] why I wouldn't loose my senses? Can't you see my house? we are completely ruined!
[12:38] they took away my everything
[12:41] my safe was completely filled with the jewelry, oh God!
[12:44] Farida, Farida... be quiet!
[12:50] dad
[12:53] dear... 
[13:02] are you fine?
[13:03] are you fine?
[13:06] didn't anyone hurt you?
[13:12] I am fine, brother
[13:16] ok tell me, how did it happen?
[14:05] Zara, look at the condition of your hair
[14:09] they are so bad due to no oiling
[14:12] please try doing oiling & take care of your hair
[14:15] you are there to take care of me
[14:18] yes, for a few days. After that you'll get married & go to your husband's house
[14:22] then who will take care of you over there?
[14:26] Zaini, I will miss you a lot
[14:31] yes, that's fine. You can come to meet us every weekend with brother Adeel
[14:36] this way we'll feel happy too
[14:39] yes
[14:41] I will ask Adeel
yes
[14:47] by the way, did you talk to Saad?
[14:52] Saad?
[14:53] yes! since he left from here, neither he had called
[15:00] also his number is coming to be off, whenever I am calling him
[15:04] did he said something to you?
[15:07] No... I didn't talk to him about anything
[15:11] then what it can be?
[15:13] I have to tell him about your date fix and... 
[15:16] there is so much of work, how can we manage without him
[15:22] I don't know
[15:23] I will call him tomorrow morning
[15:27] I have done oiling in your hair, now you can make the braid yourself
[15:32] I am going, as I am very sleepy
[15:34] thank you Zaini, thank you so much
you're welcome!
[15:58] dad, I think we shall file a report to the police
[16:02] no dear, I think we shall not escalate this matter more
[16:07] dad, what are you saying?
[16:10] if we won't file a report then they'll be more encouraged
[16:13] then they'll do the robbery in everyone's house in the broad daylight
[16:20] okay mom, please...
[16:22] dear, I do agree with you. But you also try to understand
[16:29] your wedding is round the corner, the festivities will begin from day after tomorrow
[16:33] and during that time if we'll visit the police station then it can create hurdles in your wedding too
[16:41] and then my daughters have to visit the police station too and...
[16:46] you are very well aware of the police station's environment
[16:50] besides that, the policemen will visit our house every other day and..
[16:54] will ask different kind of questions from our daughters
[16:58] and I won't be able to tolerate such a disgusting thing
[17:05] whatever loss had to happen has happened
[17:09] but the most important thing is that our daughters are safe
[17:20] ok dad, fine
[17:23] and dear, both of you shall not worry at all
[17:28] whatever loss had to happen has happened
[17:31] it will be recovered too, if God wills
[17:35] Just start wedding preparations
[17:42] but dad, they took away all mom's jewelry
[17:50] mom...
[17:53] may God ruin them, they took away all of my jewelry
[18:00] dear, don't worry
[18:02] your mother has quite a lot of other jewelry, which is in the bank's locker
[18:08] Farida, go to the bank with Adeel in the morning & get the jewelry from the locker
[18:14] and be careful that there shouldn't be any lacking while gifting to our daughter-in-law
[18:22] still you are worrying about that wretched girl! 
you don't worry about me at all?
[18:27] there shouldn't be any lacking while gifting her!
[18:32] Farida...
[18:41] did you see?
[19:32] Saad, you are this family's son-in-law. Get yourself respected!
[21:03] I had so much of headache on my entire way. I swear, I took two pain killers
[21:12] I was having a splitting headache, what to tell you!
[21:16] God, who had asked you to take so much of tension mom?
[21:21] ok leave this & tell me about Mirha's matter
[21:24] what were you saying about Mirha? Tell me in detail
[21:27] it wasn't anything though, I was just joking
[21:30] what!
[21:32] you were joking? You were saying such a big thing jokingly?
[21:36] so what else I could have done? 
If I wouldn't have done any such thing
[21:38] then you would have said Zara a wretched girl & would have ruined the entire matter
[21:42] God... you are such a big shot Mahi
[21:46] you have started to show slyness to your mother as well!
[21:49] and tell me something, why you've become so merciful nowadays towards Zara?
[21:56] why are you doing all this?
[21:58] I am telling you the last time
[22:00] if I will take her side then only I will be able to move her on the side
[22:03] are you getting it?
[22:04] whatever... but never lie to me in this manner again
[22:10] I had so much of headache, how would you know that I was in such a big problem
[22:15] I was afraid, what if Mirha is having an affair with someone
[22:19] what if some goon has trapped my daughter in his false love
[22:22] as if its very easy! Your small daughter is not so easy to be trapped
[22:26] anyways, quickly do your breakfast
[22:30] we have to go for shopping
[22:31] you've brought really bad guavas
[22:34] oh God! try to eat sometimes while thanking God
[22:37] they are all bad
[22:43] Zara, I hope nothing has happened to you
[24:20] here you go, brother
[24:23] yes, keep it here
Ok
[24:25] and yes, have you done tonight's preparation? Keep mom ready as well
[24:28] I will pick you guys on my way back
[24:31] brother, we won't be able to go
[24:33] what do you mean, you cannot go?

[24:37] mom is not well so she cannot sit there for long
[24:41] so mom will rest over there, we aren't strangers for them
[24:44] brother, you think as if everything is fine there
[24:47] however, there is a possibility that nothing is fine
[24:49] what do you mean?
[24:51] Nothing! brother please just excuse them
nothing as such is going to happen, Dolly!
[24:55] already you aren't visiting their house, they ask about you from me at all times
[24:58] and I have to say that mom is not well
[25:01] today is Zara's function, if you & mom won't go then people will make gossips
[25:06] but brother I was...

[26:11] Saad, I will leave this house very soon. Won't you come to meet me?
[26:19] Ok, I am sorry

[27:37] I am feeling so weird
[27:40] its normal
[27:41] do you know, when something different is happening in life. Then its feelings are also different

[31:08] you guys will never let anyone know that nothing is right between us

[31:20] at least spare me today!
[31:22] even today you are taunting me
[31:25] Maheen, you are doing the same thing that you've been doing until today
