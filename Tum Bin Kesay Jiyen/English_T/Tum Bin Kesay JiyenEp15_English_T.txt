[00:21] I don't know what he was thinking. The poor had to call and ask us to bring breakfast.
[00:32] Ever since I heard I was restless.
[00:39] I wanted to see what was so special about the girl you had brought for your doctor son.
[00:44] Leave it be. Boys nowadays don't listen to the choice of their mothers.
[00:47] I agreed with him because he has to spend his life with her.
[00:54] That means that you're not happy with your son's marriage.
[00:59] What difference does it make?
My son is happy and so is his father.
[01:06] All we mothers are responsible for is to raise our children.
[01:10] Anyways, it makes no difference to me.
[01:13] To tell you the truth, it feels as though my heart has died.
[01:17] Mother is being emotional for no reason, it's not like that.
[01:21] Zara is my aunt's daughter.
[01:24] My granny fixed Zara and Adeel's marriage when they were kids.
[01:28] Nothing was settled in their childhood.
[01:32] Her granny didn't care about anyone but herself, not even her children.
[01:39] Then why would she think about her grandchildren?
[01:45] What? Why are you staring at me?
[01:49] I can't lie, I'll speak whatever that is in my heart.
[01:55] I'll be clear and honest.
[01:59] I understand. Who could know her better than me?
[02:06] Sister, don't worry. Love nowadays are made in China.
[02:13] There is strength or guarantee.
[02:17] Even if it works it will only for six months, otherwise I swear to God...
[02:21] Soon love like this will be sold for cheap.
[02:29] Call your daughter-in-law.
[02:32] Let me check how long you'll have to tolerate her.
[02:35] Sure...
Go and bring Zara.
[02:39] Tell her to sit here.
[02:43] The guests will be arriving all day today, how many time will we have to fetch her?
[02:49] Sister, don't make the mistake of introducing her to everyone.
[02:54] You don't know with what intention the people will be visiting your house.
[03:01] I'll call her.
[03:03] Should I come as well sister?
[03:06] There is no need for you to go. Didn't you hear what you auntie just said?
[03:10] Mother, I was talking to Meha.
Sure go ahead.
[03:18] Bring her here quickly.
[03:21] I'm sure you must have heard that I had my brother divorced.
[03:26] I'm at peace now. I'll bring the girl of my choice now.
[03:30] Don't worry. First let her arrive here.
[03:35] I'll check her out. I can read people's forehead now.
[03:40] Really... how can you do that?
[03:44] This is an education that you have to get.
[03:47] Come here, let me read yours.
Sure, take a look.
[03:53] By God's good grace it's filled with blessings. No need to worry...
[03:59] In a few days you'll be rid of her.
If God is willing.
[04:06] Forget about that, tell me what else is written.
[04:10] I can't just read everything in one go.
[04:12] it takes some time, & let your daughter-in-law come then I will tell you what will happen
[04:17] Soon you'll get rid of her, don't worry
[04:20] ok, oh Mahi bring Zara. why are you taking so long? They are calling her & they have been waiting for her
[04:29] Girls nowadays spend too much time getting ready.
[04:42] Zara people are outside to meet you, come meet them.
[04:47] Sure... let's go.
Will you go like this?
[04:52] What will they say? Let me help you get ready.
[04:57] I am ready.
Do you call this ready?
[05:01] You're married now. Only a single day has passed since your marriage.
[05:05] Let me help you get ready.
[05:13] Ready yourself, I'll be shortly.
[05:27] Shall I say something? It will seem weird to you but...
[05:33] you didn't seem like a bride,
[05:36] it didn't look like you were getting married.
[05:40] When I help you get ready you'll look beautiful.
[05:45] Come on... people are waiting.
[05:58] I didn't know he was joking. I opened the door and...
[06:02] they came inside.
Wait a minute.
[06:04] Are you saying that Aqib asked you to come to the door?
[06:07] And when you opened the door he said that he was joking?
[06:11] Yes, but before I could close the door they came inside.
[06:17] Meha... you're not that naive.
[06:19] Don't you think something fishy is going around here?
[06:22] What do you mean?
Maybe Aqib came to the door.
[06:25] He wasn't there, if he was he wouldn't have left without meeting me.
[06:30] What if he just came to have the door opened?
[06:34] Are you suspecting Aqib?
[06:36] Sadaf, you're suspecting Aqib, are you insane?
[06:41] You should too.
[06:42] He's not your childhood friend, nor is he a relative.
[06:47] Don't put so much trust in him. You've not known him for much time.
[06:51] He's been with me for two years.
[06:54] Two years is a lot of time to know someone.
Even two years is not that much.
[06:58] Especially a person who knows how to lie.
[07:02] Don't you remember the lies you caught in the beginning?
[07:05] You were the one who told me.
[07:07] And I also told you that he had certain complexes.
[07:11] Sadaf he was afraid that I would leave him.
[07:14] But when I've made him realize that all of this doesn't matter to me...
[07:18] he hasn't lied to me since.
[07:20] You're being foolish Meha, please open your eyes.
[07:24] I know that Aqib was involved in this theft with those men.
[07:29] Sadaf you've been against him since the start.
[07:31] Quite frankly your opinion doesn't matter.
[07:36] Alright fine then. I will not be carrying any of your messages again.
[07:40] If I meet him, I'll let him know that I haven't been seeing you.
[07:43] Sadaf, will you do that to me? You could at least carry my message.
[07:48] I will not... if you want to ruin yourself then ruin yourself
[07:51] But I will take no part in it.
[07:57] Sadaf don't do this to me.
[07:59] You know that I can't meet him and that it's very hard for me
[08:03] Sadaf I'm your friend, will you do this to me?
[08:08] Please... you over think for no reason.
[08:13] Listen to me.
[08:16] Sadaf!
[08:20] My God... look how beautiful you look!
[08:27] So much makeup... I don't look good at all.
[08:32] What are you saying? You look lovely... are you among those girls...
[08:39] who are never satisfied with how beautiful they are.
[08:41] You look very pretty.
[08:46] This is too much make-up. I never apply so much make-up
[08:52] What are you trying to say that I ruined your makeup for no reason?
[08:54] So that people make fun of you.
[08:58] I'm not saying that, I'm just saying that this is too much make-up
[09:02] And you can't, because you look beautiful.
[09:09] People are waiting outside. They came here especially to meet you.
[09:14] Come on, after that you can wash it off.
[09:17] You don't apply make-up like this to yourself.
[09:20] Zara you're my sister-in-law and I'm not an enemy that would ruin your face.
[09:27] I'll tell mother that you don't want to meet anyone.
[09:32] I didn't say that, I just...
[09:34] think that the make-up is too much.
[09:36] You didn't say it, but that's what you mean. Do you think I'm a kid?
[09:40] Look... we are from a small city, with little pieces of happiness.
[09:48] Come meet them and then you can do whatever you want.
[09:52] Hmm... now come outside...
You look very beautiful.
[10:23] I think that your daughter-in-law is sleeping. I've been waiting for half an hour.
[10:29] It's a long way from Karachi to Hyderabad, I'm sure she must be tired.
[10:34] We'll meet her later.
Girls nowadays are very strange.
[10:41] I swear... when it came to us back in the day..
[10:46] we use to rise before our elders did.
[10:50] We didn't like coming out from closed doors.
[10:54] It was considered rude. But the times today...
[11:01] that guests keep arriving and the bride rests in her room.
[11:07] Fareeda why don't you make your daughter-in-law understand?
[11:12] Teach her something, after all you are her elder.
[11:16] How can I make her understand?
[11:18] All I can do is tolerate. I'll do as much as I can.
[11:23] What else... in our times we were petrified of our mothers-in-law.
[11:28] But nowadays, mothers-in-law has lost...
[11:33] their fear.
[11:42] There she is.
[11:54] Greetings*
Come sit with me.
[12:10] Fareeda... she has no match with your son.
[12:14] Your son is a handsome doctor and she has no match with him.
[12:22] What can we do? She's all we have now.
[12:27] Our son has chosen her.
[12:31] My dear, don't take it the wrong way, wash your face...
[12:35] We are unable to see your face with the kilos of make-up you've applied
[12:41] Did you apply the make-up yourself?
[12:44] Auntie, what's wrong with you?
[12:46] You're insulting her. Zara you can go upstairs.
[12:59] Fareeda... I came here to see your daughter-in-law.
[13:03] I wanted to see what kind of girl you had brought home.
[13:06] Remember what you said when you saw my daughter-in-law with the wheatish complexion?
[13:13] You said that she could be compared to a cast iron pan.
[13:17] Do you see your daughter-in-law? What can I say about her now?
[13:22] What is it said about people who are over smart?
[15:44] Alright fine. Let's forget for a moment about what they did to father.
[15:49] But why don't you understand that they won't keep you happy.
[15:55] Adeel might be with you today, but what will you do if he takes his family's side?
[16:23] You didn't tell me... what was he saying?
[16:27] Nothing special, he invited me to go with them to Zara's in-laws.
[16:31] I couldn't have left you here.
Did you complain to him?
[16:38] Mother, why would I do? Besides he didn't time, he was running late.
[16:45] Look my dear, if you talk to him about Maheen's behavior...
[16:50] then he will not like it.
[16:51] Ali should think about it. I could feel bad just the same. Am I not human?
[16:56] I have to get married in to his home and adjust with his family.
[17:01] I don't like what sister Maheen says. If I don't share it with Ali, who else then?
[17:06] That's fine, but the truth is that men and women can't be equal.
[17:13] He will be your husband soon.
Will I not become his wife soon?
[17:19] What are you trying to say? Than women have no respect?
[17:24] Forget it... don't worry about it. Focus on your health.
[17:30] Don't worry about me my dear. I only have minor blood pressure.
[17:40] Take his mug with you.
[17:45] Mother... everything's fine.
[17:50] Don't worry about me and Ali, just take care of yourself.
[18:20] How are you?
Mother!
[18:24] Mother...
Come... look who it is...
[18:28] Greeting*How are you my dear.
I'm well.
[18:33] Come Salma... come.
[18:35] Where's Zara?
In her room, where else.
[18:39] Okay... come on.
[19:09] Zara.....
Zara, what's the matter?
[19:15] Sit down. What happened? Why are you crying?
[19:22] What will crying achieve? What happened?
[19:24] Tell us what happened? Why are you crying? Everything alright?
[19:33] You were right. I've made a grave mistake.
[19:44] I've made the wrong decision.
[19:49] What happened? Did someone say something to you?
[19:57] Tell us what happened? What did they say to you?
[20:07] You told me that I should talk to Adeel about shifting to Karachi.
[20:13] You were right.
[20:17] I didn't think that Hyderabad was so far away from Karachi.
[20:25] You're lying... the truth is something else. Tell us, what's the matter?
[20:31] Why would I lie?
[20:33] I talked to Adeel about this as well. I've never stayed outside of home...
[20:40] You mentioned bringing breakfast.
[20:45] Why did you say that?
[20:47] I'm sure you know the distance between Hyderabad and Karachi.
[20:52] But this is a ceremony, that's why I mentioned it.
[20:58] Zara... have you learned in one night to perform these ceremonies?
[21:02] These cruel ceremonies have been going on for years and you want to perform them? You can...
[21:11] when you get tired, let us know.
[21:14] It's nothing like that. I was missing you two, that why I was crying.
[21:21] One more thing... do you know what Adeel gave me as a wedding present. A gold bracelet.
[21:27] Congratulations... but I'm not happy
[21:32] Because before seeing your wedding present, I've seen you crying face.
[21:39] Who else is out there?
[21:42] Is Saad here?
Everyone is out there. Come on Zaini.
[21:51] Improve your mood. Freshen up, everyone is waiting.
[22:36] Mother... I'm telling you that she is worried.
[22:39] She didn't tell me when I asked.
[22:42] Ask her please.
She would have told you if there was something.
[22:51] You have always been skeptical against your sister and Maheen.
[23:00] Did you take out all the food from the car Maheen?
Yes I did.
[23:05] We were so late sleeping at night that in the morning...
[23:09] we were so tired, that's why we were late in arriving. For that I apologize.
[23:13] That's what I was saying...
[23:17] That's what I was saying Sarwat...
[23:21] that you didn't need to go through all this trouble.
[23:24] There was no need to cook lunch and bring it here from so far away.
[23:29] We needed to do this.
[23:31] Whether you cook or we do, it's the same thing.
[23:40] That is so kind for you to say.
Besides...
[23:43] These breakfast ceremonies have grown old.
[23:48] These ceremonies were conducted when we were young.
[23:53] The time has changed... do you remember Sarwat...
[23:59] when breakfast arrived late from my home. My mother-in-law...
[24:06] may God forgive her sins... your mother...
[24:11] God help me... she was so upset... she said so much.
[24:20] Mother, forget about this. There are no ceremonies nowadays.
[24:24] I was just saying it.
Where is Adeel? Call him.
[24:32] He's out somewhere. I'll call him and be right back.
[24:36] Is she coming?
There she is...
[26:00] Why are you doing this?
[26:05] Adnan... when will you change your ways?
[26:09] Don't meddle in the affairs of women
[26:12] All of them have left home, who is left to cook then?
[26:17] So that's why they didn't take you along, so that you may do housework.
[26:23] It's not like that, they didn't leave me, I chose not to go.
[26:28] What difference does it make if I make it? Why are you objecting?
[26:32] I'm not asking for your help.
[26:36] Don't be like this.
Forget it. Let's go outside and watch a movie.
[26:43] We'll go some other day, I'm busy right now.
[26:48] Alright fine, we'll go some other day. As you wish.
Do one thing.
[26:53] What is it?
The switch in the middle is not running any water. Please fix it.
[26:59] As you wish. I'll fix it right away.
[27:06] Is it the one on the bottom?
Yes.
[27:10] He's so strange.
[27:30] Brother, who are you calling?
[27:35] Oh... you're missing Dolly right?
[27:38] No, I was calling a friend.
[27:42] Don't lie. I can see Dolly's number on your face.
[27:49] What can I do? I've been calling her for a while, she's not picking up.
[27:52] It is possible that she's with auntie.
[27:55] She told you auntie was feeling well, that's why she didn't come.
[28:01] Yes, you're right. Maybe that's why she isn't picking up.
[28:06] Don't worry, she'll call back when she's free.
[28:10] Please come inside, it doesn't look nice you standing here like this.
[28:14] Auntie Fareeda and Maheen will get a chance to talk. Come on
[28:19] Alright, go ahead. I'll be right there.
Hurry up.
[28:32] My God!
[28:34] I was starving. She brought biryani from your favorite shop.
[28:41] It's fresh.
She bought everything.
[28:47] Sarwat never liked cooking. Her daughters are the same.
[28:53] I didn't mean it that way.
[28:55] I was saying... it's good that they bought the biryani from here.
[28:57] If they had brought it from there it would have been ruined by now.
[29:01] To hell with it. Whatever she brought was for her daughter.
[29:08] Should I bring something for you? You didn't eat anything.
[29:11] I am hungry.
[29:13] Please bring me something to eat. Bring a kebab as well. Just one.
Sure.
[29:19] Hurry up.
[29:28] Are you happy?
Hmm.. very much so.
[29:34] Should I believe this?
What's there to lie about?
[29:39] God forbid it's a lie.
[29:43] Why are you so sad?
[29:45] I'm at my in-laws, not to fight a war. What is the matter?
[29:56] It seems that he's here to meet his friend. He hasn't even talked to me.
[30:01] It's nothing like that. You were sitting with everyone else so...
I'm here now
[30:07] Tell me the truth.
[30:10] What has Zara complained about me?
[30:13] She never complains and she would never complain about you.
[30:16] Really... why am I so special?
[30:20] I'm sure she will never get the chance.
[30:23] She's lucky to have a husband like you.
[30:26] Nowadays one can only find husbands like you in dramas.
[30:30] You are no less dramatic.
[30:34] Your wedding present came in handy.
[30:42] Really... then prepare yourself for a loss as well.
[30:47] What loss?
Look at that!
[30:49] We want some money for your shoes!
[30:54] Who do these shoes belong to?
[30:58] Look at it carefully, these are your shoes. 
[31:01] Now you need to pay to get these shoes back. You saved yourself yesterday.
[31:06] Zara, what ritual is this? 
I won't be participating in it.
[31:10] This is between you and your sister-in-law. Keep me out of this.
[31:14] Stop being dramatic and give me the money.
[31:18] Alright fine... if this is how it goes, what can I do?
[31:28] Here you are... is this enough?
[31:30] What is this? I'm not giving you your shoes back.
[31:34] How much more do you want?
[31:36] Why don't you say something?
It's not that much.
[31:41] Alright fine.... what can I do?
[31:43] Don't count, just give me the entire bunch.
[31:48] Thank you... here are your shoes.
[31:53] These shoes have become very expensive to me now.
[31:59] Saad... do you want your share or at home?
[32:03] I'll take it from you at home.
[32:06] Thank you...
[32:11] What should I do about these?
[32:12] Give them to me, I'll take them away.
[32:17] So tell me, how was the travel? I was tired.
[32:23] Brother, I wanted to ask you to send Zara with us for a few days.
[32:29] Our home is become silent without her.
[32:31] What are you saying Sarwat?
[32:35] She's been here only one day.
[32:38] Sarwat, I understand what you're feeling.
[32:42] For parents it's hard to be away from their children.
[32:48] But I will ask Adeel to take Zara to Karachi to visit you.
[32:56] Right now, I think that Zara should stay here.
[33:02] You're already aware of Fareeda, she won't like it.
[33:10] Alright... as you wish.
Mr. Manzoor...
[33:16] Adeel and I are here to take care of her.
[33:20] You're saying that right now uncle...
[33:22] what about when you and Adeel will have to go back to work? 
[33:26] Who will take care of Zara then?
[33:29] Maheen... your elders are speaking.
[33:34] Maheen, your her sister that's why you're worried for her.
[33:40] Adeel and I are here, there's no need for you to worry.
[33:53] Go... bring the red bag from the car.
[34:00] Ali help her.
Sure mother, I'll be right back with it.
[34:15] Where's sister and Maheen?
[34:17] I'm sure she's Mirhal's room, getting her ready.
[34:23] Why don't you rest for a while as well?
[34:29] Sure.. go ahead and rest for a while.
[34:34] What are you thinking? This is your brother's home, go.
[34:41] Sure.
[34:46] Manzoor, tell me...
[34:50] when do you intend on marrying Zaini and Ali?
[34:53] I haven't given it much thought.
[34:56] But God willing, I hope we are able to do it soon.
[35:02] That would be appropriate.
[35:06] Besides, time passes by quickly. Daughters especially grow up fast.
[35:11] Indeed.
[35:21] Maheen, did you talk about the dowry.
[35:25] I'm reminding you not to say anything like that. Please!
[35:31] We have to send them off happily, understand?
[35:36] What's the matter?
[35:37]  It's not like I'm asking them to turn their property over to my name.
[35:41] You're always on my case. Whatever they give will be to their daughter.
[35:47] They won't be giving it to me. 
[35:49] I just asked. What will I say to the people when they ask me?
[35:57] Tell those people that we had a simple marriage.
[36:02] Why don't you understand? Even if we get the dowry, what will we gain from it?
[36:07] Why do you want to lose this opportunity?
[36:11] If Zara brings something then she'll walk with pride.
[36:18] And if she doesn't she'll remain insecure.
[36:25] You're right. All of them are like their mother.
[36:29] Sarwat also spent her life enforcing her will on her in-laws based on the things your father gave her.
[36:35] That's what I'm saying. If they talk to you about it...
[36:41] you have to refuse taking a dowry. You don't have to take anything.
[36:47] Girls bring dowry, but then impose themselves on their in-laws because of it. 
[36:52] We don't want none of that.
[36:54] You are so sharp. You truly are something else.
[37:01] If you had used that brain to study I would have had two doctors.
[37:06] I took psychology, so what I didn't pass?
[37:10] What did I lose? I can read people's brain and still play with them.
[37:21] There's no doubt about it.
[37:27] Maheen... come here.
[37:34] Yes mother.
[37:37] Look...
[37:41] I brought all these clothes, which one should I give sister-in-law.
[37:44]  I kept them all inside and thought that I would decide when we reach here.
[37:47] Tell me.
Mother, can't you see how Zara is?
[37:54] She's worried, she's no happy. 
[37:57] There's a problem with her.
God forbid.
[38:01] What's with you? She just got married and now you're saying she's not happy.
[38:06] Mother, I'm telling you, she's not happy.
[38:09] She's not telling me when I asked. Please ask her.
[38:14] She would have told you if there was something. 
[38:16] It's nothing, that's why she didn't tell you anything.
[38:21] You've always been skeptical of sister-in-law and Maheen.
[38:27] And... control your tongue. 
[38:31] I don't want you to speak like that with your uncle again.
[38:36] We've come here for a short while, let it pass joyously.
[38:42] Didn't you see how happy everyone is? 
[38:45] Can't you see Mahi taking care of her.
[38:48] I'm sure Adeel made her understand.
[38:52] If something happen Adeel is here, he'll take care of it. What's your problem?
[38:59] Come here and tell me.
[39:03] Show me.
[39:08] Give this auntie, this to Mahi.. and this to Mirha.
[39:14] All of these are for the men. Give whatever you want to whomever you want.
[39:19] You've been born in my home by mistake. 
[39:22] You should have been born in sister Fareeda's home.
