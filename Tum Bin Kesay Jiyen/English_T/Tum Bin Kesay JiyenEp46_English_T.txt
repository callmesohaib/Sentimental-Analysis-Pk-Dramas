[00:12]  I had my exam today.
[00:17] I couldn't write anything.
[00:21]  What could I write?
[00:24]  I lost answers to all questions.
[00:27] what's the harm in being friends with me? Tell me
[00:29] See Saad is your friend and you're so frank with him. You laugh with him and hold his hand.
[00:35] Be my friend as well...
[00:36] The way you mind me questioning you or mom's concern..
[00:41] I do feel bad in exactly the same way.
[00:43] When you come here for Zara and not for me.
[00:46] Zaini, Zara is my friend
[00:49] and I'll not here a word against her.
[01:56] what's the matter, haven't your prayers gone quite long today?
[02:01] when one feels like talking to God, then he doesn't realize the time
[02:13] true that
[02:15] there is no doubt in it
[02:28] what's the matter, you seem worried to me
[02:33] No
[02:37] its been so many years to our marriage, that I can tell when you are worried after seeing a single frown on your forehead
[02:45] this is the beauty of the relation of a husband & wife
[02:48] I wish that everyone gets a husband like you
[02:54] what is it? Why are you laughing?
[02:56] my thinking is almost like yours
[03:00] even you are so important & special for me
[03:03] Ok then tell me, what's the problem?
[03:05] I am worried about my daughters
[03:08] specially for Zara
[03:12] wherever I go, people start asking me various questions
[03:18] about what?
[03:19] about Zara
[03:22] wherever I go, people start asking me questions related to Zara
[03:26] I've grown tired of answering people
[03:31] but why you had never told me all this?
[03:35] what I could have told you? You must have got worried
[03:39] Mr. Manzoor, daughters are some kind of a trial
[03:43] the parents heart stay worried for them even if they get married and...
[03:50] if they come back to their parents house then..
[03:55] you are right
[03:58] there are problems but I am quite worried about Zara
[04:03] and I wanted to say to you that..
[04:07] we have 2 other daughters as well besides Zara
[04:13] We have to think equally about everyone
[04:17] even Zaini needs us
[04:19] Zaini?
[04:21] don't you think that we are ignoring Zaini?
[04:25] No No, I don't think so
[04:28] I don't keep any difference in all the three, I consider them equal
[04:33] yes, I know you have never differentiated between them but...
[04:37] we get so caught up in Maheen & Zara's worries that..
[04:43] we hardly give any attention towards Zaini
[04:48] I am a mother, Mr. Manzoor
[04:51] I have just felt that way
[04:55] I was worried about Zara, but now you have..
[04:59] made me more worried by talking about Zaini
[05:07] No...
[05:11] I will speak to Zaini
[05:14] all of my daughters are my life
[05:17] all of them are equal for me
[05:20] I will talk to her
[05:24] I will convince her
[05:27] she won't have any issue in her heart
[05:45] how is this possible?
[05:48] I will not let her go there at any cost, I am telling you
[05:52] Listen, she is my daughter as well
[05:55] and whatever is better for her, I will do that
[05:59] yes, even I am her mother
[06:02] I won't let you fulfill your desire in every matter or so
[06:07] Adeel always used to stay worried because of your such antics
[06:13] why are you bringing Adeel in between?
[06:15] I will bring him in between!
[06:18] because I couldn't give him any happiness due to this attitude of yours
[06:23] but now I won't repeat that mistake
[06:28] my daughter wants to study, and she will study as much as she wants to
[06:35] but you never did any such thing for me, dad
[06:39] listen, if you also wanted to study then I would have fulfilled your this desire as well
[06:45] but you had refused yourself that you don't want to study further
[06:48] you did what you want & now its her desire to study further
[06:53] so let her study
[06:56] agreed!
[06:57] I agree that I had left the studies myself
[07:00] but mom had always taught me that a girl should know how to manage a household
[07:06] girls only work is to handle the house
[07:09] I agreed with mom & left my studies
[07:12] I took the responsibility of the entire household on my head
[07:15] Mirha should also do the same, she should listen to mom
[07:18] listen, there is a lot of difference in your mother's thinking & my thinking
[07:24] so, I haven't said something strange though
[07:27] its our family's tradition that once a girl grew up then she should get married & take care of her house
[07:34] instead of making her do the job & enjoy on her earning
[07:39] such daughters cannot manage their married life & family
[07:43] I don't want people to make such gossips about my daughter
[07:47] Listen, I don't care what people say
[07:51] let them say whatever they want to
[07:54] my daughter wants to study & she will do higher studies
[07:59] and I won't tolerate your interference in it. Got it?
[08:06] Mirha, gather your documents. We'll go to get the form in the morning
[08:13] thank you, dad
[08:15] you're welcome!
[09:19] what happened brother, aren't you in a mood to work today?
[09:23] No, I am not feeling well
[09:25] then go home, as it is its off time
[09:28] I am going in a while
[09:29] Okay, do leave on time. 
I am leaving, bye!
[09:32] bye!
[09:51] Saad, I've thought quite hard
[09:55] that what is lacking in our relation
[10:00] and I've come to a conclusion that if something is missing between us then its love
[10:08] Saad, I have decided
[10:10] when we don't have love in between us, then what we will do of this hollow relationship?
[10:17] we should get separated, Saad
[10:21] let me end this engagement
[10:56] are you in your senses, Zaini?
What are you saying?
[11:00] I shall break the engagement? Are you in your senses?
[11:03] I'm coming to meet you right away and you won't talk about it with anyone, Zaini
[11:09] I'm coming to see you
[11:28] what are you saying? He has his eyes on your house?
[11:31] yes! he was asking for my house file
[11:34] he was saying that I will help you in selling your house
[11:36] don't do this mistake, don't give him your house file
[11:39] do you think I am mad? My name is Jamila
[11:43] and its my work to make people fool
[11:45] yes sister, you are right. You've fixed really bad people
[11:49] he is such a coward, do you know what he was saying?
[11:53] when I asked him to divorce his wife, leave her
[11:55] he said, "I cannot leave her, poor woman... where will she go"?
[12:00] this is what he was saying to me, coward!
[12:03] ok leave it, now tell me what you've decided next?
[12:08] I've a very nice planning for the future
[12:18] oho...
[12:37] here, you are getting his call
[12:40] let it be, may he go to hell!
[12:42] let him swerve for sometime while waiting for me
[12:45] ok then, drink the juice its getting warm
[12:49] you always make me drink the juice only, try to spend some more on me
[13:01] what is it, why Jamila is not attending the phone
[13:32] what now?
[13:33] Adnan, you have gone from the house since morning & you haven't come as of yet. Where are you?
[13:38] wherever I go or come back, should I inform you first?
[13:42] what's the matter?
[13:43] I am worried for you
[13:46] don't worry about me, I'm fed up of it.
[13:52] just come back home
[13:53] what's the matter, is everything fine?
[13:55] yes, everything is fine. Its just that I am feeling anxious
[13:59] I am feeling so suffocated, just come back home
[14:02] Ok get a grip on yourself, I am coming
[14:06] okay fine, come quickly
[14:10] she is feeling anxious
[14:29] you've ordered very less dishes, what will happen by only 3?
[14:34] my budget was only this much
[14:37] yes but people will talk bad, they only come to enjoy food
[14:43] so shall I look at my pocket or make people happy?
[14:46] don't know what's wrong with you, you are always saying the same thing that you don't have money or so
[14:52] what else shall I do?
[14:53] look at the inflation
[14:55] Ok enough! you were discussing the same thing in the house & again you are discussing it
[15:01] Okay, leave this topic. Tell me, would you like to have an ice-cream?
[15:27] Zaini, I am waiting outside your house
[15:30] come quickly
[17:05] Zara
[17:08] Saad you!
[17:11] what are you doing here?
[17:14] nothing
[17:16] I'm sitting here just like that
[17:18] why are you here?
[17:21] you had never asked me this question
[17:24] then what had happened all of a sudden?
[17:28] Nothing
[17:30] everything is fine
[17:38] what are you hiding from me?
[17:41] why will I hide anything from you, Saad?
[17:44] the way you are not attending my call
[17:47] you've been crying since yesterday. What is all this, Zara?
[17:52] you've come to meet Zaini, right?
She is inside
[17:56] go meet her
[17:58] Zara, look at me
[18:04] and answer me what I have asked
[18:05] what is your problem, Saad? Why are you after me?
[18:09] Leave me & go inside
[18:13] I won't go
[18:15] I won't go, until you answer my question
[18:18] why are you compelling me?
[18:20] and you!
[18:23] you are testing my patience
[18:25] tell me
[18:26] Saad..
[18:29] Zara, we are friends. And I can feel your every emotion
[18:35] even if you don't say anything, still I can feel that you are in pain
[18:39] Zara, tell me what is the matter?
[18:42] tell me without any hesitation, please
[18:49] yesterday, mom had sent me inside the store to get the books
[18:54] I went inside and..
[19:15] did you inform Ali about the work that I had told you?
[19:19] yes yes, I had told him. He must be coming in a while
[19:22] he was on his way, when I had called him
[19:24] here is your tea
Oh wow! you've brought the tea. I thought Zara will bring it
[19:31] today, you can drink the tea prepared by me
[19:34] I don't make that bad though
[19:37] No dear, I mean you really make good tea its not like that
[19:49] what are you thinking?
[19:52] No, nothing I am just listening to your conversation
[19:57] hmm... did you see? Today your mother is listening to us, not telling us off
[20:05] really, when have I told you off?
[20:07] I am just joking, why are you taking it to your heart?
[20:10] I understand all of your jokes
[20:13] where is Zara, call us as well. It seems so good that all of us are sitting here & talking
[20:17] it will be good if she will come here as well. I think Ali is about to come
[20:22] call your sister, dear
[20:26] Ok
[20:28] have you seen my phone anywhere. I forgot where I have kept it
[20:33] No, it must be inside the kitchen. You might have kept it there while making tea
[20:36] yes, let me check
[20:38] call your sister
isn't Zara at home?
[20:42] No, she is here
[20:43] so why is she looking for her phone?
[20:46] the find their hands empty without phones
[20:49] oh God...
[20:54] brother, I came from outside & I saw both of them
[20:57] I tried to explain Saad that its the matter of the daughters of our family, don't do this
[21:02] and he raised his hand on me because I was stopping him, brother
[21:16] such a big thing had happened & you are still quiet?
[21:19] Saad, talk softly what if someone hears it then...
[21:23] do you have any idea that what you are hiding from everyone?
[21:28] Saad, I don't want anyone to raise a finger on my character once again
[21:31] and this way, you are giving another chance to that vile man
[21:35] I cannot do anything, Saad. Even if I want to
[21:39] I am with you, your family is with you
[21:44] your family is with you, you are not alone
[21:51] I've already experienced pain from my loved ones once
[21:55] I cannot bear it again
[21:57] who will believe me?
[21:59] do you think anyone will believe me? Nobody will listen to me
[22:03] nobody will believe me, only you think that they'll listen to me
[22:07] Zara, you've gone mad
[22:09] why nobody will listen to you?
[22:11] when I can listen to you & understand you, then won't you family will?
[22:18] come with me right away, we'll tell the truth to everyone
[22:22] come with me right now
[22:24] we will not tell anything to anyone
[22:26] we will go & tell everything right away
[22:27] Saad, have you gone mad? We cannot tell this to anyone, nobody will listen to us
[22:38] go inside, we'll go tell the truth to everyone
[22:42] lets go!
hey Saad
[22:45] when did you come?
[22:46] how are you? Fine?
[22:55] are you crying? there are tears in your eyes
[22:58] what happened to you?
Saad!
[23:00] how dare you!
Saad! leave him
[23:03] mom... Saad leave him
brother Manzoor
[23:05] brother Manzoor...
Saad, leave him
[23:08] brother Manzoor
brother Manzoor!
[23:12] are you fine?
[23:14] Saad
[23:16] what is this happening?
[23:20] brother let me tell you, I came from outside
[23:25] no brother, please forgive me I won't be able to say it
[23:33] brother, I came from outside & I saw both of them
[23:36] I tried to explain Saad that its the matter of the daughters of our family, don't do this
[23:41] and he raised his hand on me because I was stopping him, brother
[23:48] uncle he is lying, I won't leave him
Saad!
[23:52] stop it!
[23:55] uncle, I haven't done any such thing
[23:57] he is lying
[23:59] why will I lie?
[24:01] brother, have I ever lied to you? Ever?
[24:03] I knew everything but I was quiet, because our family's honor was attached to it
[24:08] Zara is like my child, so I was explaining her. That's it!
[24:15] what is this spectacle Saad?
[24:30] aunty you..
[24:34] even you won't believe me?
[24:40] are you doubting me?
[24:45] I had forbidden you that you will not come over to meet Zara
[25:09] oh God, its been so long. Mahi, call your dad and Mirha and ask them why is it taking them so long to come back
[25:15] I am not calling anyone, they will come back whenever they feel like
[25:19] what is this? What as such has happened?
[25:23] you are pretending as if you know nothing. You haven't understood that what had happened
[25:28] the way dad had favored Mirha, do you know what will be the result of giving her so much of independence?
[25:33] what do you mean, what she will do?
[25:36] mom, now she will go to the university. Its a co education institute
[25:41] she got involved with that guy in the college, when they used to study separately
[25:44] don't know what next she will do after going there
[25:47] Oh..
[25:49] I haven't thought of it
[25:51] what's the use of thinking about it now? You should have taken a firm stand at that time
[25:55] that Mirha will not go to the university. You should have got her married
[25:59] I had tried it though
[26:01] is this what you call a try?
[26:03] Ok fine, I will tell her. She won't do this mistake again, I will explain her
[26:11] as if she will understand as per your explanation. I am the only one who is suffering in this house
[26:15] oh God... who can make you suffer though?
[26:19] what are you trying to say?
[26:22] what else? You always did whatever you want to
[26:26] we have never forced you for anything
[26:29] because my antics weren't as such
[26:31] Enough, leave it. Don't make me argue anymore
[26:36] and listen, your father was asking me about your marriage
[26:41] I don't want to marry
[26:42] how come you won't marry? Make your mind, as I've said "yes" to him
[26:48] as I said, I don't want to marry
[26:50] what do you mean? Will you stay here in this house for lifetime?
[26:55] Why, have I become a burden on you people? Can't you feed me twice a day?
[27:00] oh God forgive me!
[27:05] I cannot explain you
[27:06] then don't explain me
[27:09] you can never be quiet
[27:11] you can also become quiet
[27:13] Sarwat
[27:16] had you forbidden Saad to meet Zara, why?
[27:20] yes mom, what are you saying?
[27:24] tell me
[27:26] I had asked mom
[27:33] what is this happening?
[27:38] let me tell you, brother
[27:40] until when poor Zaini would have suffered?
[27:42] one day or the other she had to raise her voice for her right & Saad...
[27:47] I already doubted Saad's intentions but I had never said anything
[27:51] because the honor of this house was so precious to me, as this matter was attached to this family's honor
[27:56] and if I would have said something, then nobody would have believed me. That's why I stayed quiet
[28:03] uncle all of these are false stories
[28:06] he is fooling you all & trying to trap both of us
[28:11] uncle, I didn't come here to meet Zara but Zaini
[28:15] Zaini, tell something to everyone
[28:19] what poor Zaini will tell? She didn't get her right until date
[28:30] brother, I knew it that Saad liked Zara & he come over to meet her. I had stopped him but...
[28:42] even Zara had never stopped him. Brother, both of them are equally responsible in this crime
[28:47] if you will utter a single word, I will break off your face!
[28:50] Saad!
[28:51] Ali...
what are you doing?
[28:54] Ali!
[28:59] Saad, tell me clearly why mom had forbidden you to come here?
[29:08] Ali, what are you saying?
[29:11] don't you believe me?
[29:15] just answer me about what I am asking you
[29:21] brother, what is wrong with you? Whatever Saad is saying is true
[29:24] what relation I & Saad can have? He came to meet Zaini
[29:28] whatever is happening is because of him, Tell everyone!
[29:33] Zaini
[29:36] tell us the level of truth in whatever Adnan is telling
[29:39] speak up Zaini
[29:40] yes Zaini, speak up
[29:47] tell us
[30:12] Zaini!
[30:21] brother...
Manzoor!
[30:22] dad...
Manzoor
[30:24] take him inside, dad..
[30:52] dad please listen to me once
[30:55] both of us are innocent, we haven't done anything
[31:04] No dear
[31:06] you guys have disappointed me a lot
[31:09] dad, whatever he is saying is a lie. At least you can listen to me for once
[31:19] tell me whatever you want to say
[31:23] whatever he had said, its nothing like that. Saad haven't done any such thing
[31:28] he did everything
[31:30] mom, you had sent me to the storeroom to get the books right?
[31:33] When I had gone inside, he came after me
[31:37] he came inside & hold my hand. I tried to call you mom but he...
[31:42] Zara Zara... why are you lying? Why are you putting false allegation on me?
[31:48] I consider you as my children
[31:52] you are putting such a vile allegation on me in order to save yourself & Saad. Oh God!
[31:59] why didn't I die before hearing this, Oh God...
[32:03] uncle, Zara is absolutely correct. There is nothing between us except for friendship
[32:08] agree now, just agree now that you love Zara
[32:12] stop your rubbish!
[32:14] do you have any proof?
[32:20] proof?
[32:23] brother, I knew this matter since beginning but I have never opened my mouth
[32:28] because I knew it, that whenever I will talk on this matter. They will ask me for a proof
[32:33] and when I won't have a proof then I will be blamed
[32:38] I already had a doubt on Saad
[32:41] I wanted to tell you many times to stop his frequent visits in this house but..
[32:46] I don't worth it, I am just a tenant
[32:50] your distant relative, therefore I used to stay quiet
[32:54] go somewhere else to do your dramas, nobody will believe you here
[32:58] and I know how vile & disgusting man you are. Will you respect women?
[33:03] oh brother, wait a second
[33:10] brother Manzoor, do you also think that I am wrong?
[33:20] Saad
[33:23] what proof do you have that whatever Adnan is saying is wrong?
[33:30] do you have any proof?
[33:33] do you have any reasoning?
[33:45] I have the same question from you, Adnan
[33:56] what proof do you have which can prove that you are telling the truth
[34:01] brother, I wanted to discuss this matter with you so many times
[34:05] but I couldn't gather the courage because I know nobody is going to believe me
[34:17] that's why, today I am compelled to show something to everyone
[34:28] look at this, brother
[35:10] I had these pictures since beginning, but I never used to show them to anyone
[35:14] because I was sure that nobody is going to believe me
[35:20] brother... your honor is so dear to me
[35:24] this family's honor is very dear to me
[35:35] I never wanted you or sister to get insulted in front of the entire world
[35:41] that's why I hid this matter from you guys until date
[35:44] yes, I made a mistake that
[35:47] I took too long to tell this matter to you
[35:51] for that I apologize to you, please forgive me brother
[35:56] you also, sister
[36:04] such a big fraud
[36:09] Ali..
[36:11] Ali I haven't betrayed anyone
[36:17] Zaini, at least you should say something!
[36:19] tell everyone that its not the truth
[36:22] say something
[36:26] why Saad?
[36:30] why you did this?
[37:02] what do you mean that you won' marry? Will you stay here in this house for lifetime?
[37:06] Why, have I become a burden on you people? Can't you feed me twice a day?
[37:09] oh God, its so difficult to explain you anything
[37:13] Greetings!*
[37:18] Greetings!*
[37:22] what was Mahi saying?
[37:25] Mahi? Actually we were waiting for you
[37:30] so we were just talking, nothing else
[37:33] is her admission done?
[37:35] yes, her admission is done
[37:38] thank God
[37:40] shall I serve dinner for you?
Okay
[37:45] Mirha
[37:49] congratulations that you've succeeded in your motive
[37:52] sister, I am not studying to take revenge from you or to signify you
[37:58] I am studying because its my hobby
[38:02] and I've learnt from my past mistakes that only education teaches you the difference between right & wrong
[38:08] you've got the sense quite early
[38:12] I got it, you should also get it now
[38:14] you..
[38:15] mom, I want to tell you something
[38:17] what do you want to tell mom?
[38:19] what's wrong, now tell me
[38:24] mom, you were worried about the university's environment
[38:27] So Sadaf also took admission in my university, so don't worry she will be with me
[38:32] thank God its good, both of you will go together & come back together. Now I am relieved
[38:39] did you hear?
[38:41] are you satisfied?
[38:53] you've made me crazy since morning
[38:57] let me go & freshen up
ok
[38:59] let me set the food
ok
[39:09] she is trying to black mail me
[39:12] me?
[39:14] silly!
[39:16] she is flying so high
[39:19] I have to do something
[39:22] otherwise, she will keep on annoying me like this
[39:26] No
[39:28] I won't give this chance to anyone to control me
[39:32] to control Mahi
[39:38] I have to do something, but what?
[39:43] this will be fine
[39:45] I have to kill her emotionally
[39:49] so that her mouth shall stay shut & my work shall also be done
[39:55] otherwise, only I will be at loss by doing strictness
[40:00] this is fine
