[00:15] You two are about to be separated
[00:18] If you want to say any last words to each then please say it now.
[00:23] I'll get going. You look beautiful as a bride.
[00:29] She was taunting me with Ali's name like he isn't my fiance.
[00:36] You know how she is, she's like that...
Please...
[00:40] All of you have have spoiled her rotten.
[00:44] I think Saad bought the ring for his size. What will happen now?
[00:55] Really...
[00:59] If the ring is Saad's size...
[01:07] then give it to Saad.
[01:14] What happened?
[01:17] What are you thinking about?
[01:21] I didn't ask you such a hard question.
[01:24] It might not be hard for you.
[01:27] But Saad is my childhood friend.
[01:30] I could never think...
[01:32] that you would suspect me this way.
[01:35] Really... that means I am not as per your expectations.
[01:42] It's like that, isn't it?
[01:51] That's what I was trying to tell you.
[01:57] There is no need to meet everyone's expectation.
[02:02] No need for that.
[02:06] You retaliated towards me for Saad,
[02:09] and I liked it.
[02:14] I'm your husband,
[02:17] but that doesn't mean that you listen to everything I say.
[02:22] And please...
[02:25] Don't try to bother yourself too much for me.
[02:33] A husband is said to be a wife's emotional God.
[02:37] It is ordered for a wife to listen to her husband's commands.
[02:41] But not of something dishonorable.
[02:46] I hope you understand this...
[02:48] I don't understand...
[02:51] How can I thank my God..
[02:56] who has written you in my fate.
[03:01] So now, I can give you a wedding present, right?
[03:18] Wow... how pretty.
[03:21] Just a second.
[03:36] Beautiful.
[03:39] Thank you Adeel.
My pleasure.
[03:47] Now don't worry.
[04:07] Saad, where were you when we were sending off the bride?
[04:12] I was there.
[04:13] Don't lie, I saw you leaving.
[04:16] Why didn't you meet Zara?
[04:19] No reason.
[04:22] I couldn't see her leave.
[04:29] What's the matter?
[04:31] You're very emotional.
[04:35] You've never shown this side to anyone else before.
[04:38] It's not like that.
[04:41] Where is it written that a man can't be emotional.
[04:45] I haven't read much books.
[04:48] But that one I'm reading right now, I'm asking this question.
[04:51] You've grown quite a tongue, who are you learning this from?
[04:57] When you can hide things, can't I make them up?
[05:01] Now tell me, why didn't you meet Zara? Where were you?
[05:06] I cannot see the bride being sent off.
[05:10] And, I've never been so far away from Zara.
[05:13] Look... every girl has to one day leave her home.
[05:17] One day, I will leave this house and come to your home.
[05:21] And Dolly will one day get married and leave as well.
[05:25] Things are different with you two.
How's that?
[05:29] You two will be in the same city, unlike Zara who's far away.
[05:36] Yes... I miss her as well.
[05:44] We've never been away from each other for so long.
[05:52] Alright... it's getting later, I'll turn in.
[05:56] I have to be up early in the morning.
[06:00] Farewell*
[06:38] How long will your mood remain off?
[06:48] Who are you speaking to?
There's no one else in the room but me.
[06:52] If there's no one else in this room but you, then I'm asking this from you.
[06:57] Really... that's a new news to me.
[07:01] Since when anyone in this house has cared for my mood?
[07:06] Alright fine... we'll care for your mood moving forward.
[07:11] Look, our daughter-in-law is here now.
[07:15] If you keep roaming around like this with a long face...
[07:19] then it won't look good.
[07:21] Does our daughter-in-law doesn't know my worth in this house?
[07:27] After all Sarwat must have made her mind before she sent her here.
[07:32] Who will be aware of Sarwat's manipulative nature if not me?
[07:39] Don't even try with me on this.
[07:42] Look, Zara is a girl from the new generation.
[07:48] And girls nowadays don't hate their in-laws for no reason.
[07:54] This is what I'm trying to explain to you.
[07:58] What are you trying to say, be clear?
[08:01] What I'm trying to say is, whatever problem you have with Sarwat...
[08:07] I don't want that affecting Adeel and Zara's marriage.
[08:14] Hmm... Mr. Ahmed, for your kind information...
[08:23] I was the one who took the barat there.
[08:25] I brought her here with affection.
[08:28] If I wanted to meddle in this marriage, Meha's broken leg was excuse enough for me.
[08:36] But no, you agree to everything your sister says to you.
[08:44] I'm sure she must have cried in front of you that I'll be cruel to her daughter.
[08:50] Fareeda, don't twist everything and put it on Sarwat.
[08:57] She didn't say anything to me.
[09:00] What I'm saying is of my opinion.
[09:04] Enough of this. Don't try to explain things to me, I don't need it.
[09:11] Go to sleep and let me go to sleep.
[09:14] The guests will start arriving in the morning. I'm tired.
[09:31] It seems I'll have to turn off the lights as well.
[11:43] Adeel, what are you doing inside the kitchen?
[11:45] I'm making breakfast.
[11:48] I can see that, but why you?
[11:53] Why? Can't I make it?
[11:57] Let me make tea...
[11:59] The tea is almost done, just two minutes.
[12:04] Who are you trying to shame?
[12:06] Do you think we'll make your wife do house chores the day after her marriage?
[12:10] Is that why you're making breakfast?
[12:14] What's the matter with you? I'm making such a lovely breakfast.
[12:18] Why are you saying such things?
[12:23] Does your wife know this?
[12:27] Why? Does it make a difference? Anyways, she doesn't know.
[12:30] She's sleeping.
[12:36] Let me tell you something Adeel.
[12:40] Don't spoil your wife so much.
[12:43] It's hard to unspoil them afterwards.
[12:48] Don't spoil Zara, otherwise you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
[12:58] I don't believe such things.
[13:02] I think doing things like this only increases love between two people.
[13:11] Shall I say something, if you don't mind?
[13:16] You complained against your husband that he didn't take care of you
[13:20] and he had the same complaint against you.
[13:23] If your brother is taking care of his wife, then you should be happy.
[13:34] I'm here and so are you.
[13:37] Let's see what happens.
[13:41] She will make you regret your decision.
[13:46] Alright fine,
[13:49] if you've left it to the future then there's no point in arguing.
[13:54] Tea is ready, tell me how it tastes
[13:56] Take it for whom you've made it. I don't want it.
[13:59] Finish up and vacate the kitchen, I've got work to do.
[14:46] Saad, I messaged you last night and you're calling me just now.
[14:50] Sorry, I just saw this. I slept early last night, I was tired.
[14:55] Is everything alright?
[14:56] Yes it is. I wanted to ask about breakfast.
[15:00] Are you guys coming? When will you guys leave?
[15:03] Why? Have your in-laws refused to give you breakfast?
[15:07] Saad, don't make jokes, I'm serious. When will you guys leave?
[15:14] Auntie came last night and asked about breakfast.
[15:17] If you guys don't bring breakfast it will be insulting.
[15:22] I'll find out.
[15:25] I'll talk to you later, let me know once you find out.
[15:29] Don't forget, farewell.
I'll find out. Farewell.
[15:45] Adeel, why did you make tea? You could have asked me.
[15:49] Why, can't I make tea for my lovely wife?
[15:56] Did you make this?
[15:59] Yes I did.
[16:01] You know what, I make excellent tea.
[16:05] I've prepared breakfast as well.
[16:08] Drink your tea, freshen up, then we'll have breakfast outside.
[16:13] Let's see how good of tea you actually make.
Okay.
[16:23] This is delicious. I didn't know you could make such a good cup of tea.
[16:29] You'll have to make tea for me daily.
[16:33] As you wish.
[16:36] Did you make breakfast as well?
[16:38] Yes.
[16:54] What are you doing here?
I'm making my bed what else?
[16:58] Go to the kitchen and see your son. He's turned into his wife's servant.
[17:00] Look at how he's making breakfast for his wife.
[17:03] Adeel is making breakfast?
[17:06] Yes, by now he must be done. He must be serving it by now.
[17:11] I'm telling you to forget your son. It would be better for you if you forget him now.
[17:16] My Lord... that accursed girl has been here one day and she's made my son her servant.
[17:23] Why?
[17:24] Is your son a child who can't speak? 
[17:28] Why are you blaming Zara? What about your son?
[17:33] No you don't understand.
[17:37] That girl and her mother are very cunning. 
[17:42] Compared to them you aren't even born yet.
[17:45] My poor Adeel is sweet naive boy. The two of them have entrapped him!
[17:52] How did he get trapped? 
[17:54] If he was so sweet and naive, then you should entrapped him
[18:01] Sure... blame me!
[18:05] Blame me on everything.
[18:10] Have you forgotten that you were the one who decided to bring her here.
[18:15] You were the one who said to get that girl married and into this house.
[18:21] And now you're telling me that I could not control my son?
[18:26] I didn't expect that you would say this to me.
[18:30] I haven't forgotten anything.
[18:33] All I'm saying is that, after seeing your son being his wife's servant don't forget...
[18:40] that one has to sweeten the knife before slaughtering the goat.
[18:45] Praise Adeel and praise Zara in front of him.
[18:51] You have to bless them with prayers.
[18:54] You're asking me to pray for Zara?
[18:58] God forbid, I cannot take such a risk. What if my prayers get accepted?
[19:04] God forbid! If it were up to me I would grab her hand...
[19:08] and oust her from the house.
[19:11] Such pride over your prayers. Do you really think they'll get accepted?
[19:15] Do you think I'm a nonbeliever?
[19:18] Mother, I'm only making you understand. You have to do this for show.
[19:23] You have to show that you're very happy.
[19:27] Don't say anything ill at the breakfast table.
[19:32]  You have to show everyone your love.
[19:35] Do you know what will happen if you get bothered by Zara in front of Adeel?
[19:39] He'll get even near Zara, do you understand what I'm saying?
Mahi...
[19:45] It is important. Get comfortable with your compulsion.
[19:50] You have to stick by this. Please don't say anything ill.
[19:55] Please, don't do anything. I'm going outside, you should come to.
[19:58] Mahi, I won't be able to do this.
[20:03] What is this hell?!
[20:07] Greetings*
[20:11] How are you feeling now?
I'm well thank God.
[20:16] Are you going somewhere?
Yes, Zara invited me to her home.
[20:19] Zara? For what? To Hyderabad?
[20:22] I don't know, it's got something to do with a breakfast ceremony.
[20:26] She asked me to bring breakfast.
[20:29] What do you mean? 
[20:30] Did Sarwat not send breakfast to Zara's home?
[20:34] My dear, this is a ceremony of ours.
[20:37] I'm surprised that she made a mistake like that.
[20:40] That's what Zara's worried about.
[20:42] Brother will you still go there after being humiliated?
[20:47] My dear it's Zara's in-laws, he'll have to go there.
[20:54] That's what I'm saying. It's Zara's in-laws and...
[21:00] auntie insulted you. How can you forget it and go back there.
[21:05] I haven't forgotten.
[21:07] I thought we were finished with this last night. What's the point in repeating it?
[21:12] Saad is right. 
[21:14] There's no point in repeating what's finished. Forget it.
That's the problem with you two.
[21:20] You don't say anything, nor do you allow me to say anything.
[21:23] Stop being angry and bring breakfast for your brother.
[21:27] No mother I'll have breakfast there. 
[21:30] Auntie said that I should have it there.
[21:32] Alright fine. It's already getting late.
[21:36] When you go there, don't mention the conversations that we had here.
[21:41] She's a child, she doesn't know much. She just gets emotional.
[21:47] Sure mother I understand.
[21:51] Alright son, take care.
[21:56] Don't be upset, I'm leaving, smile for me.
[22:03] Be safe on your travel
[22:04] Stay happy, it suits you more.
[22:12] I'll get going mother.
[22:15] Farewell*
[22:21] Mother, it's Zara's in-laws...
[22:24] Brother still runs to Zara on her single call.
[22:28] They can object that, it is your duty to make brother understand.
[22:33] Yes.
[22:55] I told your father to made them stay here for a few days. 
[23:00] We would have send them on their travels after feeding breakfast...
[23:03] but no... he doesn't listen to anyone. The poor girl had to call us to have breakfast sent over.
[23:14] What?
[23:17] I told your father to made them stay here for a few days. 
[23:21] We would have send them on their travels after feeding breakfast...
[23:24] but no... he doesn't listen to anyone. The poor girl had to call us to have breakfast sent over.
[23:31] It's not a big deal mother. 
[23:33] They've made breakfast all their lives, so what if they made it one more day?
[23:39] Uncle Ahmed refused that there would be no breakfast ceremony
[23:43] Men do not know anything about this. 
[23:46] This ceremony has been going on for decades.
[23:49] It's obvious that sister Fareeda said something, that's why she called. 
[23:53] Lord knows what she'll say when we don't send her the breakfast at all.
[23:56] Mother please, no can stop aunt Fareeda from talking.
[24:01] Even if you had taken breakfast, she would have found something else to talk about.
[24:04] She can't even digest her food if she doesn't lay out a few taunts.
[24:10] She's not wrong. This is an old tradition. 
[24:13] It's our mistake, we should have been there.
[24:17] Mother, we didn't do anything wrong.
[24:20]  Auntie Fareeda doesn't like Zara and she'll make sure of taunting Zara over everything.
[24:27] Will Zara call us over everything now?
[24:31] Why are we arguing amongst ourselves?
[24:34] We have to go there. So let's get ready and get there as soon as possible.
[24:41] Sister Fareeda starts preparing lunch till ten or half past ten.
[24:46] She's not like us, where breakfasts are made till twelve in the afternoon.
[24:50] I told your uncle to take you and leave home by four or five.
[24:57] It's done now... if we couldn't be there for breakfast...
[25:01] then we should be there for lunch. Let's take lunch for Zara.
[25:05] Every generation before you was an idiot, right?
[25:09]  They had their breakfasts and lunch on time. You guys will do as you want.
[25:15] After all you are all so educated! Do whatever you want.
[25:19] The hell with this problem!
[25:23] Saad, what about you? Can't you say what's wrong, wrong. 
[25:26] This is not a good habit.
[25:28] And... besides... we made these rituals and we can end them as well.
[25:35] These rituals can only end when these issues aren't used as excuses to make the lives of women hell.
[25:40] You do know there's a difference between the family of the bride and the groom?
[25:45] I used to, but after yesterday I've started to understand.
[26:01] What's the matter? Why isn't Mirha at the breakfast table yet?
[26:07] Maybe you've forgotten,
[26:09]  Mirha is injured, she hurt her leg and it is bandaged.
[26:15] She'll have breakfast in her room.
[26:17] She haves breakfast with us daily, so what's wrong today?
[26:22] She was forced to come, what could she have done?
[26:27] You guys couldn't even delay the wedding till she got better.
[26:33] That is true. Things were unjust with her. 
[26:37] The entire wedding she was on a wheelchair.
[26:41] Sister trust their brothers so much.
[26:44] I think you should still think about it.
[26:47] I think you should postpone the reception till she gets better.
[26:53] Listen to me... I just asked why Mirha wasn't at the breakfast table.
[26:59] I didn't think so far ahead.
That's your problem.
[27:04] You don't think about the future.
[27:10] Mahi, check in on the bride. She's late, bring her here.
[27:18] She should be at the breakfast table on time. 
[27:22] One shouldn't keep food waiting, it's bad manners.
[27:26] I'll be back with her.
Greetings*
[27:31] You're quite late for breakfast. 
[27:34] Your mother was getting upset, she said that one shouldn't make food wait. It's bad manners.
[27:40] Sorry uncle, I was helping Mirha.
[27:45] No need to worry for her. 
[27:48] Only her foot is injured, she can do things for herself.
[27:52] Mirha how much will you make you the new bride work?
[27:56] Learn something from your brother.
[27:58] He couldn't even get up in the morning, 
[28:01] but today he's been up since eight to make breakfast.
[28:17] My dear, come sit.
[28:20] Have breakfast.
[28:20] Yes please start, so that we may eat something as well.
[28:29] Some chickpeas?
I'll help myself.
[28:35] What about you?
Have some.
[28:41] Here you are.
[28:46] What will you eat?
Anything will do.
[28:49] Pass me a slice please.
[28:52] Won't you take something?
[29:05] What need is there for this? 
[29:08] Mother has spoiled auntie Fareeda and Mahi for no reason.
[29:13] Mother asked me to do this and I'll have to do this.
[29:19] Who is it?
It's Usama.
[29:22] Why aren't you talking to him?
[29:24] I'll talk to him when I feel like it. I don't want to right now.
[29:27] Why are you doing this sister?
[29:29] You ignored him at sister's wedding as well. 
[29:34] You shouldn't test someone patience that way.
[29:36] Why are you concerned over nonsense things?
 Get ready, we're already running late.
[29:42] I'm going.. let me pack this first.
Go, I'll pack this!
[30:02] Saad hurry up, we're running late, we have to be there with lunch.
[30:06] Let him drink his tea in peace. Go ahead my dear.
[30:11] Saad, you've taken good care of mother in my absence.
[30:15] Mother gives you more importance than me.
[30:20] Someone has to fill in the space you left behind.
[30:24] You are right, that means I'll have visit often, otherwise mother will forget me.
[30:32] Mothers cannot forget their children, even if they live across the seven seas.
[30:37] But it is true that Saad has stood by me like a son.
[30:42] For me, the two of you are equal.
[30:45] Still... thank you so much Saad.
[30:50] Invite Dolly as well, she should come with us as well. Right Saad?
[30:57] Whatever you think is right. 
[30:59] You should go and meet mother, she missed you.
[31:02] You haven't met her yet?
[31:04] No mother, I got busy the moment I got here and I couldn't meet her.
[31:08] I'll meet her right away.
Be sure to come back quickly.
[31:12] I made mince, store it in a hotpot, I'll go and change.
[31:16] Alright mother... did you check your Whatsapp, I sent you a list of dishes.
[31:21] I didn't...
Hurry up then.
[31:23] I'll pack up.
Let me finish my tea.
[31:25] Hurry up, I'll be right back.
[32:04] What's the matter? Are you still upset?
[32:10] I'm not upset.
[32:11] This sentence that wives use about them not being upset...
[32:15] That means that you are very upset.
[32:22] Leave it be... you shouldn't talk to me.
[32:27] I will imagine that you're still abroad.
[32:59] Listen.
[33:02] If you don't mind telling me, why didn't you talk to me properly last night?
[33:08] I was tired and I wanted to sleep.
[33:12] Are you hiding something from me?
[33:14] What could I possibly hide?
[33:16] Anyways, brother Saad told me that you guys are leaving for Hyderabad.
[33:20] Yes, that's what I came. Why don't you come along?
[33:25] Me going there isn't important.
[33:27] It isn't important for anyone to go, but they are and you should come.
[33:33] Someone has to stay with mother and brother Saad is going.
[33:37] I know everything about her medicine.
[33:41] That's not a big deal...
[33:43] Let's take auntie as well.
Mother cannot travel such a long way. What's with you?
[33:48] Anyways, you guys should get going, you're already late.
[33:52] Yes... you're right.
[33:56] I wanted you to come along, but I didn't think about your mother. Sorry.
[34:03] It's alright. 
[34:04] Someone with a mother would understand, everyone thinks that exaggerate things.
[34:10] Exaggerate? Do you think I feel that?
[34:14] Do you think that I was saying that to you?
[34:17] Dolly it's getting a little confusing. Be straight with me.
[34:25] We'll talk after you return from Zara's in-laws.
[34:32] Alright. As you wish.
[34:36] Alright then.
[35:25] Zara.
[35:31] You seem upset.
[35:34] I'm not upset.
[35:37] Then what's the matter?
[35:40] Why are you worried? 
[35:42] Do you miss your family?
[35:46] I've never stayed outside my home.
[35:54] Zara.
[35:57] You're not a strange place, you're at your own home.
[36:02] This is your home now as well.
[36:05] I understand that, but I was talking about my father's home.
[36:10] Yes... that's true.
[36:16] If you want I can video call him for you.
[36:20] I called no one picked up.
[36:23] They must be busy.
[36:25] So busy that they can't talk to me?
[36:29] Why? Can't they be?
[36:31] No... call father, I want to talk to him.
[36:34] I called him, his number wasn't dialing.
