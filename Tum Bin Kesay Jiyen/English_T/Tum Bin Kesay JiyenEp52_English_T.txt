[00:58] Ali, did you make your friend talk to the doctor?
[01:04] Yes mom. I made the doctor talk to him.
[01:07] Dad is handling the police.
[01:10] Don't worry. Everything will be alright. We'll handle everything.
[01:13] Tell them to let me see my daughter once. I won't be at peace until I see her.
[01:19] Once I saw her, I'll be fine.
[01:22] Mom, not now. Just wait for a little while.
[01:25] The doctor will tell herself.
[01:28] Don't worry. Everything will be alright
[01:31] .
Oh God, have mercy.
[01:37] Why did you do this, Zaini? Why did you?
[01:43] Mom!
[01:50] Why is she here? Tell her to go away from here. Tell her to leave.
[01:57] Why are the two of you here?
[01:59] Is there something left?
I want to meet Zaini.
[02:02] I'm warning you. Don't even take Zaini's name.
[02:07] She is in this condition because of you.
[02:11] If something happens to her, I will not forgive you two.
[02:14] Mom, what are you saying? Nothing will happen to Zaini.
[02:18] Her life is as dear to me, as its to you.
[02:21] At least, let Zara meet her.
[02:23] She cannot.
[02:25] And if something happens to her, we'll never forgive you two.
[02:29] What are you saying? Nothing will happen to Zaini.
[02:32] Tell them to leave Ali. Tell them.
[02:36] Mom..
Didn't you two hear? Leave!
[02:40] I will not leave, until I meet Zaini.
If you don't leave,
[02:48] then you'll see me dead.
Mom..
[02:53] Go from here. Go.
[02:56] Why are you being so harsh? Why?
[02:59] I have nobody other than you. Don't do this to me.
[03:02] This man standing with you.. he's all you have now.
[03:07] We don't have any relationship with you.
[03:16] Doctor, how is my daughter?
[03:19] See, your daughter's condition was very serious but timely treatment saved her life.
[03:26] But please try and not do anything similar with her again
[03:30] which gives her stress or makes her repeat this mistake.
[03:35] It isn't good for her mental health.
[03:37] Doctor, can I meet my daughter?
[03:41] Not yet. After a while, one by one.
[03:45] We will keep her under observation today. You can take her home tomorrow.
[03:49] Thank you doctor.
Thank God.
[03:58] Didn't you hear what the doctor said? You will not see her. Leave.
[04:16] Come on Zara.
[04:39] Adnan.. Adnan.. wake up and listen to me.
What is it?
[04:44] Wake up.
Oh.. whats the problem? What happened?
[04:48] We have to go to the hospital.
[04:49] Right now? If you're unwell, we'll go in the morning.
[04:53] I am fine. Zaini, downstairs, have taken sleeping pills.
[04:57] Zaini took sleeping pills?
[04:59] Yes. Sarwat called that she had taken sleeping pills.
[05:02] They're at the hospital. We'll have to go too.
[05:04] They have gone to the hospital, right? I cannot go. I'm sleepy.
[05:08] You're the limit. Why shouldn't we go? We have to go.
[05:10] If there was an emergency, we'd have received a call from the hospital. We didn't. This means she's fine.
[05:15] We'll go in the morning.
[05:17] Adnan, come with me. Please.
[05:19] Listen, I'm sleepy. If you're not sleepy, shut off the lights and go.
[05:29] Keep on sleeping.
[05:34] Sleep!
[05:58] You?
[06:00] What are the two of you doing here?
[06:03] You shouldn't have come here.
[06:06] Zaini's condition is because of you two.
[06:21] Maheen, you go. I'll come.
[06:26] Maheen? Maheen?
[06:44] Did you two meet Zaini?
[06:49] They didn't let us meet.
Don't cry. Everything will be alright.
[06:53] Its not right for you to meet Zaini right now. Her condition isn't good
[06:58] Usama is right.
[07:01] It isn't right to meet Zaini right now.
[07:03] Don't worry Zara. As soon as Zaini is better, I'll ask aunty and uncle.
[07:08] Everything will be alright.
[07:21] Saad? You people were very late.
[07:24] What happened? Everything alright?
[07:27] Yes mom. We were waiting for Zaini to stabilize.
[07:31] How is she now?
[07:36] She's better.
Hmm.. But how did this happen?
[07:40] Why are you asking him, mom?
[07:44] Ask Zara. She's behind all this.
[07:50] Its because of Zara that Zaini attempted suicide and now my life is in trouble.
[08:00] How many of you will you fool with your innocence?
[08:03] You should be ashamed of playing with your sister's life.
[08:10] What are you saying? Are you in your senses?
[08:13] You let it be, brother.
[08:16] Whatever is happening is because of Zara.
[08:19] Its because of her, Zaini is in this condition.
[08:28] I'm telling you brother.
[08:31] If Ali leaves me, I'll leave this world.
[08:37] And you both will be responsible for all this.
[08:39] Dolly, what happened to you? What are you saying?
[08:42] What are you saying? Why are you blaming Zara? Its not her fault.
[08:51] Yes. Zara is never at fault. We are.
[08:56] No matter what we do.
[08:58] No matter what she does, she'll always be right and we'll be wrong.
[09:03] What do you want brother? What do you want?
[09:07] We'll have to bear this trouble all our life.
[09:11] Saad, dear, whether both of you accept it or not.
[09:15] But it is because of the two of you, Dolly's life is being affected.
[09:19] Do you know Ali is calling her again and again and threatening her?
[09:25] If God forbid, something happens to Zaini..
[09:32] Aunty, Ali isn't like this. Whatever he said, he said in anger.
[09:36] He cannot do this. He loves Dolly a lot.
[09:39] He loves her a lot.
[09:41] I saw.
[09:50] Dolly?
[09:53] See Zara.. Talk to your family, dear.
[09:59] If its because of you that Dolly's life is destroyed,
[10:03] you'll not stay in this house too. I'm telling you.
[10:45] Zaini? My dear..
[10:51] Let the patient rest, don't talk much.
[11:06] What did you do, my child? If something had happened to you then?
[11:13] Mom.. Mom..
[11:19] Why did Saad and Zara do this to me?
[11:25] Why did Saad break my trust mom?
[11:29] Why did they do this to me? What did I do to harm them?
[11:39] If they...
Please don't recall. Don't punish yourself.
[11:48] Life doesn't stop if anybody leaves, my child. We're here with you.
[11:56] I am here.. Your dad is here. Do you even know how your dad is right now?
[12:04] For us dear. For us dear. Be strong.
[12:10] Please compose yourself.
[12:13] Mom, I'll never forgive them. I will never forgive them.
[12:19] She was my sister, mom.. Why did she do this to me?
[12:28] Enough my child. Enough..
[12:34] Why did she do this to me, mom? I'll never forgive her.
[12:40] I'll never forgive them.
[13:18] Zara, compose yourself
[13:21] Stop crying.
[13:24] What can I do, Saad?
[13:30] My siblings, my home,
[13:36] I've lost everything.
[13:43] Everybody feels, I'm the culprit.
[13:49] Even here, everybody thinks the same.
[13:52] Your mother, your sister, everybody feels the same.
[13:55] Saad, you do know I didn't do anything, we didn't do anything. We're not at fault.
[14:03] We didn't do anything.
[14:06] Zaini is right.
[14:09] Zaini was right. I should have died with Adeel.
Zara!
[14:12] I cannot tolerate it Saad. I cannot bear it, Saad.
[14:17] If something happens to Zaini, Saad, I won't forgive myself. Ever.
[14:22] Zaini will be alright. Will she?
She's fine. We talked to the doctor. She's fine.
[14:32] Please compose yourself
[14:35] I'm fine. Zaini.. Zaini.. Nothing should happen to Zaini.
[14:46] Saad..
[14:50] Will nobody talk to me now?
[14:55] Will they leave me alone now?
[14:59] Zara...
Saad.. I want to talk to Zaini. Make me talk to her. I'll talk to her.
[15:10] I will clear her misunderstanding. I want to tell her I didn't do anything, Saad.
[15:16] There's no use discussing this now, Zara.
[15:19] Its too late now.
[15:21] Zaini's life is destroyed. Because of me.
[15:30] Whats wrong with me, Saad?
[15:34] I destroyed Zaini's life. What did I do.
[15:42] I destroyed Zaini's life.
Zara, you go to sleep for a while.
[15:51] I will not be able to sleep, Saad.
[15:54] Try.
[15:58] Will Zaini have slept?
[16:01] Will she have felt sleepy?
[16:04] She must have slept. You also sleep.
[16:08] Try.
[16:27] Ali.. take your father home. I'm here with Zaini.
[16:34] No mom. I'll stay here.
[16:36] How can I go home, dear? What if something happen to her?
[16:41] How will I be at peace? I cannot rest.
[16:46] Nothing will happen mom. I'm with her.
[16:50] You can come in the morning.
[16:53] Aunty, Ali is right. A lot of people cannot stay here and even I think Ali should stay.
[17:01] You and uncle come with me. I'll drop you.
[17:08] Alright. We'll go after a while. We'll take a riksha. Don't worry.
[17:14] Don't be stubborn. Go with Usama. I'm here with Zaini.
[17:26] Sit by her bedside. Don't move.
[17:29] Even if she feels a bit unwell, call me. I won't be able to sleep.
[17:35] Mom, don't worry. I'll be with Zaini. I'll keep updating you.
[18:04] Happy engagement anniversary..
[18:10] I'm so sorry, I completely forgot.
[18:15]  Zaini, I'm sorry. It skipped my mind.
[18:20] I'm sorry.. 
[18:24] Zaini..
[21:08] Oh, why do you bother? You could have asked Shaista to do everything.
[21:12] Yes. You could have asked me.
[21:16] I made soup for Zaini. I thought I'd make her eat it today.
[21:21] How is Zaini now?
[21:23] All thanks to God.
[21:27] So when will she be discharged from the hospital?
[21:29] I think she'll be discharged by today.
Thank God, her life was saved.
[21:35] Just pray for my daughter to be patient, Shaista. She's seen a very tough time.
[21:41] Let her come home. We'll make her busy.
[21:44] Manzoor told me to get her enrolled in a university.
[21:48] Yes. This would be better for her. If she's busy in her studies, she'll forget everything.
[21:54] Alright. I'll leave now.
If you say, should I come with you?
[22:00] Adnan is right, Sarwat. Go with Adnan. Why trouble Manzoor?
[22:07] I would be grateful if you drop me, Adnan.
[22:10] Give this to me.
Lets go.
[22:14] Alright. I'll leave now.
Yes. You go ahead. I'll look after everything.
[22:19] Maheen said she'd come and look after the kitchen but its her sister in law's engagement today. I asked her to come tomorrow.
[22:25] Why do you worry? I'll look after everything.
[22:28] Family comes to help in such troubled times. We'll handle everything together.
[22:32] Alright. I'll just come.
[22:35] Don't worry. I'll handle everything. Don't worry.
Come dear.
[22:55] Hello girls.
Where were you lost?
[22:59] Actually I had gone to Lahore.
You didn't even tell us.
[23:03] I didn't get time. I was in a rush, I couldn't tell.
What did you get for us?
[23:08] Its a surprise.
Give it to me. I cannot wait.
[23:13] Wait a minute.
[23:19] What is this?
My engagement card.
[23:22] You're getting engaged? 
[23:24] To whom?
So many questions at once? He's my aunt's son.
[23:29] He's in Lahore. My parents have accepted his proposal for me.
[23:32] You've given us a very good news.
[23:35] Congratulations.
This won't do. You people have to come with your family.
[23:40] Of course. We'll definitely come. Isn't it Mirha?
[23:42] We'll definitely come.
[25:26] Zaini?
[25:41] Why are you here?
How are you?
[25:50] Are you here to see how I am still alive?
[25:58] Why have you become so distrusting? 
[26:02] I'm here to meet you. For you.
[26:09] Saad.. you already have someone else in your heart now.
[26:23] At least, don't lie to me now. Please. Leave.
[26:36] I have nothing left to give you, except hatred.
[26:45] Of course. You can hate me but.. don't think I'm a cheater.
[26:54] I never cheated on you Zaini.
[26:59] Disloyal men never accept they have been disloyal, ever.
[27:06] In fact, they pretend to be loyal to hide their sins. Exactly like you.
[27:20] You doubt my loyalty? 
[27:22] Alright. But don't punish yourself.
[27:29] If something happens to you, I'll never be able to forgive myself.
[27:35] You've already punished me.
[27:43] I wanted to be rid of this punishment forever, but I couldn't.
[27:55] See, even my fate isn't merciful.
[28:04] Maybe I'm alive so that I can hurt about your disloyalty forever.
[28:51] Zaini, please. 
[28:54] Please trust me once. 
[28:58] I will fix everything. I promise I will. Just once.
[29:10] What will happen then? What? Will you come back to me?
[29:22] Will you leave Zara? 
[29:25] Tell me, Saad. Will you come back to me?
[29:34] Saad, my heart is broken into a thousand pieces. 
[29:40] Its not possible for it to break into more pieces.
[29:45] You have turned down my love. What else do you want from me?
[29:52] Zaini..
Saad please.. Leave from here.
[30:00] I don't even want to see your face. Please Saad, 
[30:04] leave from here. Excuse me.. is someone there?
[30:15] Excuse me? Nurse?
[31:08] Was this Saad? He came out of Zaini's room? 
[31:14] Will Zaini be alright?
Everything will be alright.
[31:18] Hold this. I'll come in two minutes. You go to Zaini.
Go and see.
[33:25] You're luck is good Saad. 
[33:28] But don't worry. I'll not spare you.
[33:36] Zaini? Saad went out from your room? Why did he come?
[33:43] He was apologizing?
[33:45] How dare he come here? I'll talk to the staff. I told them not to let anybody else come here.
[33:51] No mom.. Let it be. He will never come back to meet me.
[34:01] This was our last meeting. 
[34:06] Please mom.. I don't want to talk about it now.
[35:13] Saad, my heart is broken into thousand pieces. 
[35:19] Its not possible for it to break anymore.
[35:24] You have already turned down my love. What else do you want from me?
[35:31] Zaini..
[35:35] Saad please.. Leave from here. I don't want to see your face.
[37:30] Dolly? You haven't eaten anything since morning. Eat something.
[37:37] Why are you here?
[37:39] Who told you to make breakfast for me?
[37:41] You haven't eaten anything since morning.
[37:43] Aunt is worried because of you.
[37:46] You think you'll make breakfast for me and I'll eat it?
[37:50] Its not like that, Dolly.
Pick it up and go. I don't want to eat.
[37:56] Why be upset with food? You're not eating and aunty is worried.
[38:01] Mom is worried because of you, not because of me, Zara.
[38:06] And you're sitting here so comfortably. 
[38:10] You're not even guilty or embarrassed.
[38:14] You didn't even worry about your sister's feelings.
[38:17] Don't say that Dolly. She's my sister and I worry for her.
[38:23] I can see that. I can see how hurt you are or how you worry about your sister? 
[38:30] Zara, anything that your shadow touches,
[38:33] it gets destroyed. 
[38:36] Take it and leave my room.
[38:43] And don't ever enter my room without my permission. 
[38:48] I'm amazed to see you. 
[38:51] Your face is so peaceful and satisfied.
[38:56] Looking at you so peaceful, I get uncomfortable, Zara.
[39:04] If Ali leaves me, I'll not let you live peacefully.
[39:15] I'll destroy you. 
[39:18] Remember this. 
[39:21] Take this and get lost.
[39:26] Take it away from here, please.
[39:48] Zara? Why did you go see Dolly?
[39:53] I just wanted to make it up to her.
[39:56] I can see whatever you're trying for.
[40:00]  I told you to talk to your family. Did you talk to someone?
[40:07] No. I couldn't talk to anyone. 
[40:11] Mom and dad are worried about Zaini. Give me some time
[40:16] Let it be.
[40:17] If I depend upon you, my daughter's house will be destroyed. 
[40:23] You cannot handle it. I'll talk to them myself.
