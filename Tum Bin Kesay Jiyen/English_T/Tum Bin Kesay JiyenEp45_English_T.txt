[01:06] Ali, dear, why did you have to be so formal? What was the need?
[01:11] Aunty, mom has sent these and you'll have to eat them.
[01:14] How can I eat all this all alone?
[01:17] You will have to. You need to take care of your diet.
[01:20] Only then will your weakness will subside.
[01:24] And if you don't eat, I'll take you home with me.
[01:27] Mom will take care of you then.
[01:29] My child..
[01:31] How can I thank you for all your love and kindness?
[01:36] I can just pray for your happiness and prosperity. Amen.
[01:42] How is Zara?
[01:44] Zara, is good.
[01:49] She is thinking to work a job.
[01:52] Job? Why?
[01:54] Actually, dad wanted Zara to get married again.
[02:01] And she isn't agreeing for it. She is thinking to work somewhere.
[02:06] Ali, you need to make her understand.
[02:10] What will people say if she works a job?
[02:14] People? Who people and what will they say?
[02:18] Its good that she wants to work. I don't see anything bad in it.
[02:24] No. It isn't bad. Nobody has worked in our families that's why..
[02:32] Yes, you're right.
[02:36] But nobody in our family ever needed to work.
[02:39] Maheen and Zara got married young and Zaini is still studying.
[02:44] We never discussed this.
[02:46] And if Zara has an option now, I don't think there is anything bad about it.
[02:52] As it is, today girls are greater in numbers as compared to men in the field.
[02:58] Even in our office, we have 60% girls.
[03:01] Ali is right. Whether its a girl or a boy, they should work. It gets them everything.
[03:10] And if Zara works, she'll get distracted, its good.
[03:14] Yes aunty.. this is what dad thought before allowing her.
[03:20] Alright, what about your job? How is it going?
[03:25] Yes aunty, its going well.
[03:29] Will you keep talking or will you get something? Ali is here..
[03:33] let me bring tea, sorry
thank you!
[03:35] in fact you should have dinner before you leave.
No aunty.. it'll get late.
[03:41] Come fast dear.. And tell me how is your mother?
[03:58] No Saad don't come again. Don't.
[04:03] Sometimes we need to leave friends behind to save relationships.
[05:10] Hello?
[05:12] How are you Zaini?
[05:14] I'm fine. How are you?
[05:18] I'm fine too. I have to talk to you.
[05:30] Tell me, what is it?
[05:34] Did you say something to Zara?
[05:37] No. Why did she say something to you?
[05:42] Zaini, tell me the truth, did you say something to Zara?
[05:44] So what?
[05:47] Saad, I didn't say anything to Zara. And even if I did.. what would you do?
[05:53] Zaini, this isn't the answer to my question.
[05:56] Then you tell me, what should I say?
[05:59] Zaini, Zara is very upset and she isn't talking to me at all. I don't know what did she not like.
[06:05] Tell me did something happen at home?
[06:09] You're so worried about Zara.
[06:13] If only..
[06:16] you only worried a little about me.
[06:20] Zaini, you're making unnecessary connections.
[06:24] Do you know Saad?
[06:27] I had my exam today.
[06:33] I couldn't write anything.
[06:36] What could I write?
[06:39] I lost answers to all questions.
[06:44] I didn't have anything to say or write.
[06:50] What could I write, when..
[06:52] I didn't remember anything?
[06:54] Zaini, whats wrong with you?
[06:58] What are you doing to yourself?
[07:01] This is the only thing I can control.
[07:04] You've gone crazy. What are you thinking?
[07:09] What do you think? What am I thinking?
[07:13] If you're making an issue out of my friendship with Zara..
[07:17] Issue..
[07:21] this is the issue..
[07:24] Zaini, listen..
[07:26] Zara is only my friend. Nothing else.
[07:30] And Zara doesn't know anything about it. Please don't tell her anything.
[07:34] Why don't you understand me?
[07:37] Saad, will you now shout at me?
[07:45] You're fed up of me?
[07:47] Alright. I'm sorry.
[07:50] But stop thinking that.
[07:53] You're still worried about Zara.
[07:57] How can I make you believe my love for you?
[08:00] Saad, where you have to make someone believe your love..
[08:04] Love no longer exists there.
[08:07] The relationship is enforced, not lived.
[08:14] Love isn't a thing that you can tell someone.
[08:22] Saad if you love me, then why can't I feel it?
[08:29] Even when you're associated to me.. why do I feel myself incomplete?
[08:38] Tell me Saad.. do you have an answer?
[08:46] Saad, say something. I'm talking to you.
[08:49] I need an answer..
[08:52] Saad..
[09:01] Bye..
[10:02] Saad, where you have to make someone believe your love.. love doesn't exist there.
[10:10] The relationship is enforced, not lived.
[10:17] Love isn't a thing that you have to tell someone about it.
[10:25] Saad, if you love me, why can't I feel it?
[10:32] Even when I'm associated to you.. why do I feel incomplete?
[10:43] Sometimes we have to leave friends behind to save our relationships.
[11:28] Zara?
Yes mom?
[11:31] Zara, can you do me a favor? Are you busy?
[11:34] No. Not at all. Did you need something done?
[11:38] Your father told me to get the books out from the store with the maid.
[11:42] He needed to give a few old books to the kids.
[11:45] I didn't remember it earlier.
[11:48] Can you help me get out the books from the store?
[11:51] All of them. Take the keys. The store is locked.
Yes.
[13:15] What are you doing here?
[13:20] I asked you a question but you didn't answer me.
[13:25] What answer?
[13:27] I asked you if you'd be friends with me.
[13:30] You didn't answer me and ran away. Now I'm asking you. Tell me.
[13:34] Will you be my friend?
[13:36] Have you lost your mind? Aren't you ashamed of such cheap thoughts?
[13:41] What is there to be ashamed about?
[13:43] You're friends with Saad. You're so frank with him. What will happen if you become my friend? Be my friend.
[13:50] People like you don't understand the meaning of friendship
[13:54] That's why I'm telling you..
[13:55] Move back..
[13:56] You make me understand the meaning of friendship.
[14:00] Move back. Leave.. If you don't leave, I'll call everyone. Go away.
[14:06] If you call everyone, I'll be scared. For God's sake, don't call anyone.
[14:10] Whats the harm in becoming my friend?
[14:13] See Saad is your friend and you're so frank with him.
[14:15] You laugh with him and hold his hand. Be my friend as well...
[14:24] I'm warning you. I'm warning you. Don't take a step further.
[14:33] I'll not spare you.
[14:37] I'll avenge this slap.
[15:32] What happened?
[15:36] Saad.. actually..
[16:35] What happened? Why are you so angry?
[16:38] Why do you look so disheveled? Did you have a fight?
[16:41] No. You go from here and I didn't fight with anyone.
[16:44] Don't eat my brain. Leave me.
[16:47] Tell me, who did you fight with?
[16:49] I didn't fight with anyone. Leave me alone. Spare me.
[16:54] If you have a headache, should I make you some tea and give you a painkiller?
[16:58] Give me poison. I'll be rid of you. I'm asking you to leave me alone. Go away.
[17:04] Why are you so angry? I'm leaving!
[17:41] Zara? Tell me. What happened? Why are you crying?
[17:45] I'm asking something.
[17:49] Zara, I'm worried.
[17:51] Saad, leave. I cannot talk right now.
[17:54] But Zara..
[17:55] Please leave from here, right now.
[18:18] Hello aunty..
[18:21] Saad, when did you come?
[18:24] I just came a little while ago.
[18:27] I wanted to meet Zara but I think she's in the washroom so I couldn't meet her.
[18:32] Alright. You can meet Zara later. Come sit with me for a while.
[18:36] Of course.
[18:40] Will you have tea? Should I make it?
No. I had it at home.
[18:49] You seem worried. Is everything alright?
No. I'm not worried. But..
[19:00] Do you want to say something?
[19:04] I want to say something to you
[19:07] but I don't know how..
[19:11] I think I've always taken you as my mother.
[19:15] You can tell me whatever is in your heart, without any hesitation.
[19:25] Dear, you're watching how we've been through a mess lately.
[19:37] Zara's life is in front of you.
[19:43] I have three daughters and if any one of them is in pain, I get hurt, dear.
[19:53] I just want to take precautions and move ahead in my life.
[20:04] I'm afraid now.
[20:08] I don't understand. What are you trying to say?
[20:13] Dear, your friendship with Zara is very old
[20:18] and I've never objected on your friendship. But,
[20:24] when people outside start talking, things come to the house as well.
[20:34] I wanted to say that.. dear you please come here a little less.
[21:56] Mirha?
[22:00] What has she done to her room?
[22:41] Saad.. dear, don't mind what I said. I don't doubt your intentions dear.
[22:52] But I don't want anyone to point a finger at my daughters.
[22:58] For me, Zara, Zaini..
[23:02] both of them are equal.
[23:05] And you're more than Ali for me, Saad.
[23:10] Do you understand me?
[23:15] Yes aunty..
Do you talk to Zaini?
[23:19] Yes aunty.. Sometimes.
[23:22] She's often busy studying and I'm at my job but we do talk a little.
[23:30] I'll send her to you.
[23:37] Give her time, dear.
[23:40] She needs your attention and time, more.
[23:46] All of us are there for Zara.
[23:54] I'll try.
[24:04] I'll send her.
Sure.
[25:08] Oh.. did you see? She is such a strict woman. She's hurting her daughter in law.
[25:15] Mirha, what is this?
[25:18] Where did you get this from?
[25:20] This isn't the answer to my question. Answer me what I asked you.
[25:23] Whats wrong Mahi? Why are you arguing with your sister?
[25:27] Wait a minute, mom. Let me talk to her.
[25:29] Tell me what do you want to talk about?
[25:33] Who allowed you to fill this form?
[25:35] Whats the issue in this?
There is an issue. There is a big issue.
[25:40] You will not step out of this house to do as you please.
[25:43] You better not cross your limits.
[25:45] Can someone tell me what are you arguing about?
[25:50] She filled the university form without our permission. She's getting an admission.
[25:54] What?
[25:55] And even if I have filled the admission form, what is your problem?
[26:00] Oh Mirha.. how could you take such a big decision yourself?
[26:06] This is what I'm saying. Who allowed her to do this?
[26:11] She will not go to the university. She will not leave this house
[26:15] Why? Why shouldn't I study further?
[26:18] I want to build a career for myself like my friends.
[26:21] Really? Have you grown up so much that you'll decide for your life, yourself?
[26:26] At least, I'll not let you decide for my life.
[26:29] Listen to her.. Her tongue wags like the scissor.
[26:33] What is wrong with you Mirha? Why do you want to study further?
[26:39] And why do you need to study further? You'll end up in the kitchen as it is.
[26:44] Mom, I don't want to end up in the kitchen like you.
[26:47] I want to study, mom..
[26:49] Enough. I'll not hear another word, Mirha.
[26:55] I did bring an educated daughter in law in this house.
[26:59] What did she do? Didn't you see?
[27:03] Should I blacken my face sending you to the university?
[27:07] Nobody is going anywhere. Listen to me.
[27:11] Take care of the house. Take care of the kitchen from tomorrow.
[27:14] In fact, not from tomorrow. From today. Mahi..
[27:20] She'll be making flat breads at night.
[27:24] Did you hear? You'll make the flat breads.
[27:30] Mahi...
[27:45] She has lost her mind. She spoilt my entire drama.
[28:35] I want to talk to you.
[28:40] Your silence has already said everything. 
[28:44] What more do you need to say?
[28:48] Your words have lost all meaning.
[28:53] Zaini, its important that we talk.
[28:58] Hows that? 
[29:02] Mom told you to talk to me?
[29:12] Then you should have told her no? 
[29:17] Or couldn't you say no?
[29:18] Zaini, why are you talking to me like this?
[29:25] Saad, the person you're here to meet.. she's in her room. Go and meet her.
[29:31] Zaini, I'm here to meet you.
[29:34] If only.. this truth was evident in your eyes as well.
[29:47] Zaini, whats happening to you?
[29:50]  Why are you doing this?
[29:52] Aren't you tired of asking the same question again and again?
[29:57] Why did aunty tell me to come here less often or meet Zara less or to give you more time?
[30:02] Oh.. so..
[30:06] you didn't like this.
[30:08] I don't understand you Zaini. First you told Zara and then your mom. Why?
[30:17] I didn't tell anyone, anything.
[30:18] Don't lie. If you didn't say anything, why did aunty talk to me?
[30:23] I don't know. You should go and ask her.
[30:28] Zaini, what are you trying to prove, doing all this?
[30:30] Am I trying to prove something? Or do you prove that you don't value me at all, coming here everyday?
[30:37] Do you even realize that?
[30:40] Zaini, you're over exaggerating.
[30:43] Am I over exaggerating? Then you tell me, how should I react? 
[30:49] Maybe you could tell me whatever is going on in my brain, its true or false?!
[30:54] Zaini, the truth is what you don't want to listen to. 
[30:57] This is stuck in your mind and you keep arguing to me about it?
[31:01] Am I arguing with you?
[31:03] The way you mind me questioning you or mom's concern.. 
[31:08] I do feel bad in exactly the same way.
[31:11] When you come here for Zara and not for me.
[31:13] Zaini, Zara is my friend and I'll not here a word against her.
[31:20]  You can think whatever you want.
[31:24] I'm tired of giving you explanations. 
[31:29] Zara was my friend, she is and she always will be.
[31:35] Nobody can stop me from taking care of her or meeting her. Not even you. 
[31:43] My intentions are pure.
[31:47] And next time, I'll not argue with you about it.
[33:30] I had never thought Adeel that you and I will be together for such a short time
[33:38]  and that we'll part ways so soon.
[33:42] After you left, I didn't realize, I'd be so unsafe, Adeel.
[33:51] I want to come to you. 
[33:53] Please call me to you.
[33:57]  I cannot tolerate all this.
[34:25] Hello?
Hello. Are you back?
[34:28] I just did.
What did you bring?
[34:33] This is for you?
[34:35] Such a heavy dress?
[34:38] Wear it on the engagement, you'll look good.
[34:41] You know I don't wear such clothes. It won't suit me and everybody will laugh at me.
[34:48] Its good.
[34:50] It is good. How much did it cost?
[34:53] 8000.
[34:55] Only 8000? 
[34:58] Did you even think about your wife once before you bought such a cheap dress?
[35:03] Do you know, when we have events in our house, dad at least gets us dresses worth twenty five, thirty thousand. 
[35:10] And its your sister's engagement and I'm her only sister in law.
[35:14] You didn't even think once before buying this dress.
[35:18] See, I don't have bungalows and properties like your father.
[35:23] I could only buy this in my salary and this inflation. 
[35:27] If you don't like it, I'll get it returned.
[35:30] No. I'll wear it since you brought it for me.
[35:37] Will I get tea?
I'll get it.
[36:12] What happened brother? Why are you so quiet?
[36:16] Nothing. I was just listening to the news.
[36:19] It doesn't seem so. It seems your thinking something else.
[36:23] Its nothing. Its just work related tension these days.
[36:29] Brother, don't take so much stress.
[36:32] I do try not to take stress. But now you tell me, how is Ali? 
[36:36] Is everything alright between you two?
[36:39] Everything is alright but he's very busy these days.
[36:42] How is his office coming along?
[36:44] There are a lot of problems with his job these days.
[36:48] What sort of problems?
[36:49] I don't know. He said there had been a change in management in his office and some other issues. 
[36:57] He's caught up with those.
[37:00] Alright.
[37:02] Zara wants to work?
[37:07] Yes, she was thinking about it but I don't know.
[37:13] Didn't you talk to her?
[37:15] Yes I did. But let it be. She'll work when she wants to.
[37:24] Is everything alright between you and Zaini?
[37:28] Yes. Why?
[37:31] No. I was just asking. Do you want tea?
[37:34] Yes. Get me a cup, please.
[38:11] What are you doing? Come mom is calling you.
[38:14] I'm not coming.
[38:15] Have you forgotten mom asked you to make flat breads at night? You have a duty.
[38:22] I will not touch any chore.
[38:24] So what will you do? I tore your forms.
[38:29] So what? I'll buy a new form. In fact I'll fill an online form.
[38:35] So you'll not listen to us?
[38:36] No. And not yours at all.
[38:40] Wow.. even the ant has learnt to fly.
[38:47] Do you know what I can do?
[38:52] And do you know what I can do? After all I am your sister.
[38:58] You've done enough blackmailing. 
[39:01] Your blackmailing will not work any more.
[39:05]  If you stand in my way, I'll stand in yours.
[39:14] What will you do? Tell me.
[39:19] I'll tell everyone.
[39:21] That you were the one who called Aquib that night. Not Zara.
[39:25] Enough Mirha.
[39:27] Its enough. If you try and come in my way, I'll not spare you.
