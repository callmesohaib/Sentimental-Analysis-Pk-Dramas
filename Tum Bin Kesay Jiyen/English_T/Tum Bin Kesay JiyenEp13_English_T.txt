[00:15] She can't bear this Zara. 
[00:18] So You are intentionally pushing yourself towards that hole.
[00:24] You have still time to think about it. 
[00:26] You have still time to make a right decision.
[00:30] Adeel is with me. He will handle Maham. 
[00:34] And what's wrong with dad, why will he share the half expense?
[00:38] So tell this to your father and brother.
[00:42]  Your dad is so keen to give everything to his sister.
[00:48] You are so fond of creating dramas.
[00:52] So do my mimicry in front of everyone. 
[00:57] Now tell everyone.
That aunt was apologizing like this.
[01:15] where are you taking me?
[01:16] please come...
look at this
[01:21] this... 
[01:25] what is all this?
[01:27] bride's car
[01:29] what was the need for it, brother? All this is done by the groom
[01:34] that's the problem, we give all the importance to the groom's family
[01:38] not to our sisters
[01:40] when the groom's car is decorated, he starts his new journey with his wife
[01:46] but we want our sister's life to stay full of fragrances while she gets wed off from this house
[01:52] there shouldn't be any obstacles in it
[01:55] that's why we have decided that today you'll go to the parlor & hall in this car
[02:00] tell us, how do you find it?
[02:03] very nice! 
thank you!
[02:06] thank you, brother
[02:08] its all Saad's idea, he did everything
[02:11] yes, true that
[02:13] lets quickly go inside before your mother-in-law catches us
[02:17] yes, you guys shall go I am coming
[02:19] Alright, come quickly. Ok?
[02:29] Saad
[02:36] I want to talk to you
[02:44] I know about what you wanted to talk to me
[02:47] I'm very sorry, Saad. Aunt shouldn't have insulted you like this
[02:52] I apologize on her behalf...
Its ok
[02:55] forget it
[02:58] and why are you saying sorry on her behalf?
[03:00] it was my mistake, also you were stopping me
[03:03] but I was... 
anyways!
[03:06] today is such a big day of your life
[03:09] and to get this day, you've faced every danger
[03:11] you fought the battle of love by going against everyone
[03:15] today is the day of your victory, for which you had been waiting for so long
[03:20] Saad, I will beat you!
[03:23] then don't make such faces. What will people say, that we gave them the girl with a bad face
[03:28] come inside
[05:28] oh wow!
[05:30] All praise to God.... evil eye off
[05:36] you are already beautiful but you are looking more pretty after becoming a bride
[05:44] may God protect Adeel, right?
[05:48] on such a joyous occasion, its evident that we shall have a picture together. Say what?
[05:56] look here, over here... 
[06:00] hey!
please go away from here
[06:02] I'm just taking a selfie. Anyways, you are looking beautiful after becoming a bride, look here
[06:07] look here, smile... fix your scarf
[06:10] here... oho!
[06:14] wait! look at this picture
[06:17] oho, you've ruined it
[06:20] what are you doing here?
[06:21] what's wrong? You are always angry
[06:24] please go
Saad, stay here
[06:27] please go, they are already calling you
[06:30] yes, you shall stay here
[06:32] the time for separation is near, if anything is left to be said then go ahead
[06:40] okay then I am leaving
[06:41] please go
[06:42] by the way, you are looking way too beautiful after becoming a bride. I am leaving now
[06:47] this guy will get good beatings from me!
[07:00] please sit down, come on
[07:13] why are you worried?
[07:23] I don't know
[07:26] I am so scared
[07:29] I don't understand
[07:36] I don't know why I am so afraid
[07:40] but I am feeling so afraid, Saad
[07:42] afraid about what?
[07:43] I am with you
[07:46] no matter whatever fear or problem you have, just call me
[07:49] I will come running for you
[08:02] do you remember... 
[08:04] I always used to say, "leave me after getting wed off"
[08:12] today when you are getting wed off, so I am loosing my life
[08:27] anyways, your in-laws are saying that they'll do the departure ceremony soon after the completion of pictures
[08:36] I won't come to see you off
[08:43] take care of yourself
[08:47] take very good care of yourself
[08:58] Saad!
Saad... 
[12:24] Mr. Ahmed, I gave you my daughter
[12:28] today on wards, not me but you are her father
[12:35] just try that she doesn't cry while missing me on any matter
[12:43] I will be grateful to you
[12:56] brother Manzoor, you did a favor on us by handing over the piece of your heart to us
[13:02] I will try my level best that neither you or she shall have any complaint ever
[13:09] Take care
[14:42] yes mom, everything went well
Okay
[14:45] brother, what does sister Maheen think of herself?
[14:48] she keeps taunting me on every other matter. It feels as if she haven't learn to talk without taunting
[14:53] what's wrong? Has she said something?
[14:57] she said something? 
Mom, She was after me in the entire wedding ceremony
[15:01] I was on the hit list. She was taunting me about Ali for every other matter as if... 
[15:05] as if he is not my fiance but I have some inappropriate relation with him
[15:09] you know her nature, she is like this with everyone.. 
please brother!
[15:13] all of you have spoiled her by saying that its her nature. Its not like that
[15:17] And, you shall leave it brother. You don't mind any of her words at all
[15:23] tell me something, Zara's in-laws gave you the gift themselves right?
[15:27] did Zara said anything or did her family said anything?
[15:30] did anyone asked them that why they had misbehaved a lot?
[15:34] dear, they are her in-laws. They are the groom's family & our guest
[15:40] mom, what shall I do if they were the groom's family?
[15:42] is this some way? 
[15:43] they are the groom's family or our guests so do they get the right to do whatever they want to!
[15:47] brother, everyone's respect is equal
[15:49] so, I am accepting that it was my mistake!
[15:52] first, I had made fun of her 
[15:54] yes yes, all is your mistake. Whenever you fight with Zara, then its your mistake
[15:58] Whenever you fight with Zainy, then also it was your fault
[16:01] but whenever you fight with me, you make such a long face
[16:03] isn't it your fault at that time? 
At that time, only I am being accused
[16:06] Ok ok, forgive me
[16:09] I am telling you as well that its all my mistake
[16:11] and you know what, ask mom. What did the doctor said, when I was born
[16:16] congratulations, a mistake is done!
[16:18] on brother, you always joke around
[16:20] Okay enough, now end this argument. Spit your anger
[16:24] now its done, everything is fine. Its ok
[16:28] we shouldn't come into anyone's words
[16:30] come on
[16:33] at least drink tea
yes, serve me
[16:38] what difference does it make, if they would have gone after one day?
[16:41] I had told them the girl is so tired, don't make her travel for so long. But no!
[16:46] sister Farida only does whatever comes to her heart
[16:52] not only a few hours has passed that your daughter has gone
[16:56] and you've started to miss her
[16:58] its not about missing her, Mr. Manzoor. Its about principles
[17:02] its about manners
[17:04] they were staying here, right? In our house
[17:06] what difference it would have make if they would have stayed here for one more day?
[17:10] if you think about principles Sarwat, then now they have more right on Zara than us
[17:17] they did whatever they found better
[17:19] it will be wrong if we'll do an objection
[17:22] yes yes, I know that too
[17:25] but my heart isn't accepting 
[17:27] how can I accept that within a day I have lost my right from my daughter
[17:32] others have more right than me
[17:37] its quite strange
[17:39] that you always talk about sending back Maheen from our house
[17:44] now you are doing questions upon Zara's departure too
[17:48] there is a lot of difference between both of them
[17:51] don't know whether there is a difference, or you are doing it
[17:56] both are our daughters
[17:58] Maheen knows how to fight for herself
[18:01] while Zara is different
[18:03] She starts crying if she sees anyone with long face
[18:06] don't know how sister Farida will treat her
[18:10] remember my words, Sarwat
[18:16] she is only our daughter
[18:20] and now she is others daughter-in-law as well
[18:24] if you'll meet Zara while considering this difference
[18:31] then you won't feel much hurt
[19:12] I have warmed up some rice, would you like to have some?
[19:15] No, you are eating rice so late night & then you'll say that you are getting fat
[19:19] I am so hungry. Do you know the entire kitchen was a mess, just now I have cleaned it all
[19:24] why, where is Dolly?
[19:26] has she left?
[19:27] yes, she has gone
[19:29] by the way, she should have stayed
[19:32] she should have thought about you, no?
[19:37] by the way, I saw you talking to her in the same manner
[19:41] what if she will mind, then?
[19:42] So? Let it be
[19:45] As it is, I haven't said anything wrong
[19:48] do you know how many days prior people cousins come to stay over & help them?
[19:53] and look at her, she came only when Ali had arrived
[19:55] just to do the drama & show off that look, how much work I am doing
[19:59] She would have come, but her mother wasn't well. How could she come after leaving her alone?
[20:04] yes, so? She could have brought her too
[20:08] we had never objected
[20:11] what is this? She came like a guest & left like a guest
[20:14] and did you notice, how she was snatching the garlands from me
[20:18] just to show off Ali, that look how much work I am doing
[20:22] why are you favoring her so much?
[20:25] yes! obviously you'll favor her after all she is your only sister-in-law
[20:30] if she hadn't been my sister-in-law. Still, I do realize about others compulsions
[20:35] and I understand it very well
[20:36] yes yes, even I am understanding your compulsion
[20:40] also I do understand that her mother wasn't well, still she came one day prior to the wedding
[20:46] that's quite enough
[20:48] yes, but what she did after coming here? She just sang a few songs
[20:52] she haven't done any work, or did any favor on us
[20:55] the rice are hot, would you like to eat some?
[20:57] No, I don't like to become fat. You may carry on
[21:01] I am looking at the pictures
[21:03] look, how pretty I was looking
[21:05] See... 
[21:08] hmm.... this one is more pretty
[21:11] look, how pretty is this one
[21:13] wow!
[21:15] I think Saad has bought the ring of his size, what shall we do now?
[21:26] Okay
[21:30] if its of Saad's size then..
[21:38] give it to Saad
[22:04] hey, let me get off
[22:06] oh God! I am so tired
come on
[22:09] mom, did you kept my earrings?
[22:11] yes, I did. At least help her to get off
[22:13] why shall I?
[22:19] Sorry Zara, we couldn't do any preparation for your welcome
[22:26] as they pour flower petals or so.
Since there was nobody home so...
[22:30] but Adeel your friends could have done that
[22:32] True that! they could have done it for sure
[22:39] but its alright, our bride isn't a kid
[22:44] she is sensible, and she knows that such things cannot be catered in a hurry
[22:51] if her parents would have given us time, then we would have done all arrangements by fulfilling our heart's desires
[22:58] what to do, we are helpless
[23:01] its not looking good to take the new bride inside the house without flower petals or so
[23:11] but anyways... welcome is done by heart. These flower petals doesn't make any difference
[23:18] May God forgive us, people pour the flower petals on the funeral too
[23:24] as well as on the grave.
Shall we go inside?
[23:29] its ok mom, why are you worrying?
[23:33] As it is, these things doesn't affect Zara at all
[23:38] shall we go?
[23:39] yes, lets go. Come on
[23:42] come
[23:42] lets go Zara, come
[23:46] let us go first, then you may bring her
[23:56] Welcome!
[24:19] we'll take a group photo of you all
[24:21] smile please
[24:28] stop it! How many more pictures you'll take? One after another
[24:32] I'm fine but she is tired, she is a bride. Let her go
[24:35] lets take a couple photo. Aunty, please move aside
[24:39] I am already so tired, do let me know when all these things are over
[24:45] move away, give me side
[24:48] move....
Adeel, move aside
[24:56] please take a side
[24:58] lets take one couple photo
[25:01] dear...
[25:04] sir, look here. One couple photo
[25:08] smile please
[25:11] maam, look here
[25:14] smile please
[25:16] thank you!
[25:17] take one picture with your dad too
[25:41] what are you doing?
[25:43] are you checking my phone in my absence?
[25:46] I am not checking
[25:48] its already checked, I had picked it to make a call
[25:51] listen to me very carefully
[25:53] I hate such wives who doubt their husbands & check their phones
[25:59] why you've kept so many pictures of the girls in it?
[26:02] there is a picture & video of every girl in it, why you have captured it?
[26:06] there was an event going on, so I was just taking pictures of everyone
[26:11] so, people take their own pictures & videos in an event. They don't make it of others
[26:15] but your phone is full! So many pictures & videos of girls
[26:18] I have captured my pictures & videos, & along with mine I took of others too
[26:23] we do make our pictures & of our loved ones right?
[26:27] yes, true that
[26:28] I am also your family
[26:30] but there isn't any of my picture of video in it. Show me
[26:35] where am I, tell me!
[26:36] show me if you have any of my picture of video. 
Look, don't you feel ashamed?
[26:42] where am I? tell me
[26:47] rubbish discussion!
[26:53] don't know what is happening to you!
[26:55] the more you are becoming older, the more you are getting crazy!
[27:00] what's wrong! Why you've brought me inside the room?
[27:03] I wanted to get my pictures clicked with everyone outside
[27:05] do you want your tongue to be caught?
[27:07] I feel like pulling off your tongue & curling with your broken leg. Sit quietly!
[27:12] why are you talking to me like this? What have I done now?
[27:16] you haven't done anything, you are so innocent
[27:20] have you forgotten, you got this house robbed.
now rot here!
[27:24] Mahi...
[28:08] here you go Zara, your gift
[28:12] Adeel's granny gave me on my wedding
[28:16] they are gold bangles & quite an expensive ones
[28:22] they are so nice, aunty
[28:24] thank you! 
thank you so much
[28:28] oh Adeel, didn't you tell your wife not to call me aunty
[28:34] mom, you may tell Zara that by which name she shall call you
[28:41] I was just joking
[28:45] its her choice, she may call me by any name
[28:48] As it is, if I'll ask her to call me mom then she won't say it with her heart
[28:56] no matter what anyone says, it doesn't make any difference
[29:00] one's respect is done from the heart
[29:04] ok I am leaving as I am so tired
[29:07] I have to get up early tomorrow morning, as the guests will start visiting
[29:11] oh yes! Zara... will your family bring breakfast tomorrow morning or not?
[29:18] what did your mother said?
[29:23] mom, what are you talking about?
[29:26] what am I talking about?
[29:28] it happens, it has been happening since always
[29:31] the bride's family bring the breakfast the very next morning of the wedding, I am not saying something strange
[29:37] I...
[29:39] I don't know about breakfast
[29:42] oh...
[29:45] Sarwat didn't discussed anything with me as well
[29:47] anyways, its alright. I will call & ask them tomorrow morning
[29:50] there is no need to ask them, mom
[29:53] it won't look good that they'll come to give breakfast from so far
[29:56] you are talking so weird, mom
[29:59] they won't come to give breakfast from so far my dear, they will come to fulfill the traditional customs
[30:05] even we had gone so far to get your wife after the wedding
[30:10] we have brought her here from so far, right?
[30:16] this tradition is useless
[30:17] there is no need to do it
[30:19] you might find it useless, but ask Zara
[30:23] a daughter's family is her pride!
[30:28] it gives a good impression to their in-laws house for life time
[30:32] its not just about breakfast items
[30:36] right Zara?
[30:38] anyways...
[30:40] its fine if they cannot bring it, I will make it myself
[30:44] no problem
[30:46] after all, its Zara's uncle's house as well
[30:51] look at me, what I am discussing. I think I am so tired right now
[30:59] I am leaving, you guys shall also rest. See you tomorrow morning
[31:26] Zara
[31:31] what happened?
[31:33] if my family won't bring breakfast, so will aunt mind it?
[31:40] even you will say this?
[31:42] See, I won't like it if they'll bring the breakfast from so far
[31:51] listen, don't you worry
[31:54] everything will be fine
[32:31] are you still awake?
[32:33] were you waiting for my call?
[32:35] Ali, when you knew it that I was waiting for your call. Then can't you call me earlier?
[32:39] you enjoy while making me wait
[32:43] are you still upset upon my late arrival?
[32:45] I have become habitual of all this
[32:48] oho, I had told you that I couldn't get the leaves
[32:53] else, who comes late at his own sister's wedding?
[32:57] you only remember Zara's henna ceremony, don't you care about how I was waiting for you?
[33:03] then you shall also keep a henna ceremony, then I will remember yours as well
[33:08] you are only waiting for it
[33:11] rest you don't care about anything
[33:13] ok listen, come on the video call. I want to see you
[33:18] really?
[33:20] you've realized it quite soon, by the way
[33:22] what's wrong, have you washed your face?
[33:24] if I have to see the same face after spending quite a lot of money then...
[33:27] Ali, its so wrong!
[33:31] your money gets wasted upon my makeup?
[33:34] by the way, do you know its so wrong to make fun of any girl's makeup
[33:39] what's wrong? I am just joking, I am not making fun of you
[33:45] Ali, there is a slight difference between joking & making fun of someone
[33:50] only that person can understand, who is either doing the joke or making fun of someone
[33:54] and the guy whom we are making fun of, he is unable to understand anything
[33:58] what's wrong? You aren't liking any of my words
[34:02] is your mood fine?
[34:05] honestly Ali, even right now I don't feel like talking to you
[34:09] I want to sleep
[34:12] Okay fine, go to sleep
[34:16] I will talk to you tomorrow
[34:19] Okay, bye!
[34:25] what happened to her!
[34:49] what is this?
[34:53] You get worried on such petty matters
[34:57] I used to consider you so courageous
[34:59] I don't want aunt to have any complain against me
[35:06] that's why I got a bit worried
[35:09] so this is a good thing
[35:12] that nobody shall have any complain
[35:15] but if anyone will have any complain
[35:18] then its normal
[35:20] what's the need to get worried in it?
[35:26] Okay won't you take the wedding gift from me?
[35:30] today, first I will give you the wedding gift
[35:34] really?
[35:35] does it happen this way?
[35:37] It was Saad's idea
[35:39] he was saying, we boys are not that free of cost that you may look at us freely
[35:44] one second
[35:48] for you
[35:52] give me your hand
[35:56] it doesn't fit you
[35:58] I think Saad has bought the ring of his size, what shall we do now?
[36:09] Okay
[36:13] if its of Saad's size then..
[36:21] give it to Saad
[36:24] have you mind it, Adeel?
[36:27] No
[36:28] why would I mind?
[36:32] because if I will mind about Saad's words, then you will mind it
[36:36] so why will I mind it?
[36:40] do you find mine & Saad's friendship wrong?
[36:44] do you have any problem with our friendship?
[36:46] yes, I do have a problem!
[36:48] I don't like your friendship with him
[36:52] a girl & a boy can never be friends
[36:56] but you have never said such things ever
[37:00] now I am saying
[37:02] will you agree with me?
[37:04] which matter?
[37:07] today onwards, you won't have any relation with Saad
[37:11] the friendship that you guys had, was in the past
[37:15] not anymore
[37:18] now he is just a stranger for you, nothing else
[37:24] got it?
[37:26] tell me
[37:28] do you agree?
[37:34] what happened?
[37:37] why are you thinking too much?
[37:41] I haven't asked you such a difficult question
[37:44] its not difficult for you
[37:47] Saad is my childhood friend
[37:50] I couldn't imagine that you'll keep such a condition on me ever
[37:55] Okay...
[37:58] it means, I am not as per your standard
[38:02] right?
