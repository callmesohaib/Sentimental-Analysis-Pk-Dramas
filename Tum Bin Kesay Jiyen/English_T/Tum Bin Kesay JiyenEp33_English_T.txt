[00:12]  Dolly, Maheen shouldn't have done whatever she did with you. I am so ashamed of it
[00:22] She did all this to humiliate me in front of all, so that I shall stay ashamed in front of her for lifetime
[00:28] but I will also see, that how come she'll stay happy after coming here
[00:33]  what's your problem? Why are you after her?
[01:06] okay bye
bye!
[01:09] Saad, you!
[01:13] yes I... 
[01:14] but you have your office at this time
[01:18] I took a half day today
[01:21] what as such important work it was that you took a half day?
[01:27] sit, let me tell you
[01:30] Okay
[01:56] So, tell me
[01:58] what do you wanted to say?
[02:02] Zaini, I wanted to talk to you
[02:04] by the way, I know what you want to say
[02:08] what do you know?
[02:09] You want to talk about our marriage
[02:15] yes but... 
[02:17] but what?
[02:20] Zaini, I cannot marry you
[02:45] what happen, from where you are coming in such a hurry? Is everything fine?
[02:49] hey! you seem worried. What happened, tell me
[03:02] it seems that poor girl's heart got broken once again
[03:31] Zaini, listen to me
[03:35] when you don't want to marry me then what's left to be heard?
[03:45] at least, listen to me...
that...
[03:49] you don't want to marry?
[03:53] but Saad on that day
[03:56] when you had expressed your love for me, what was all that?
[04:00] Zaini, I am compelled. I want to marry, but right now I am helpless
[04:06] Can I know?
[04:10] what as such compulsion is it?
[04:12] Zaini, I want to settle down. I am not ready for this
[04:25] when you've already said too much, then tell me the truth as well
[04:29] what do you mean?
[04:31] what are you trying to say?
[04:32] that... you don't want to marry because of Zara
[04:39] Zaini, you are crazy! From where Zara came in between?
[04:42] She had always been in between us, Saad
[04:47] and this reality can never change
[04:49] you are thinking wrong, there is nothing like that
[04:55] try to recall, at the time of our engagement we had decided not to marry until I get settle
[05:02] and you had agreed on it
[05:04] all of these are excuses, Saad!
[05:07] you are still lying to yourself & to me as well
[05:10] for God sake Zaini, try to understand my point
[05:25] Zaini, listen to me
[05:27] Zaini!
leave my hand
[05:29] listen to me
I said leave my hand. Saad, leave my hand!
[06:28] Maheen will apologize to Dolly 
[06:31] Come on, apologize!
[06:36] Maheen didn't you hear, what he is saying?
apologize to Dolly
[06:56] when did you come?
[06:57] nobody told me
[06:59] Greetings! actually you were sleeping after taking your medicine that's why I didn't wake you up
[07:04] Greetings!
[07:07] why did they call you?
[07:08] Actually they had to visit Ali's in-laws house that's why
[07:12] you must have gone there being the elder sister, right?
[07:15] obviously, why? I shouldn't have gone there?
[07:19] No no, you should have gone there for sure
[07:22] but you should have taken your husband along with you, after all he is the eldest son-in-law of that house
[07:28] he wasn't required there aunty, dad was there to look after everything
[07:32] hmm... right. Because they don't treat a son-in-law like a son-in-law in your family
[07:37] what are you trying to say?
[07:39] see, I don't like to beat about the bush
[07:43] if you've decided to live with Usama, then you have to fulfill my wish too
[07:50] what kind of a wish?
[07:52] for the heir of this house
[07:55] its been 4 years to your marriage, and you haven't given any good news to my son as of yet
[08:00] look at your sister, its been only a few months to her marriage & God has blessed her with a good news
[08:05] and you... 
[08:10] do think about it
[08:48] I was missing you a lot, mom
[08:50] my child, why don't you call me then?
[08:55] do you know, I keep waiting for your call at all times
[08:59] then I think about calling you myself
[09:02] then I think, she might be busy somewhere else she would have called me herself
[09:07] when brother Ali is coming back?
[09:10] God willing, he is coming back day after tomorrow
[09:11] I have so many complaints with you, mom
[09:14] a lot had happened & you didn't even tell me
[09:17] what I should have told you, dear?
[09:19] one thing or the other was happening here, Maheen didn't left a chance 
[09:25] to get us humiliated
[09:27] even brother Ali was so worried
[09:30] how he cannot be?
[09:33] he got trapped very badly. One side is his wife & on the other side is his sister. He doesn't want to make anyone upset
[09:40] I have asked brother Ali as well, not to worry at all
[09:44] mom, can't you get this wedding done earlier by talking to dad?
[09:49] you know sister Maheen, she never want this wedding to happen
[09:54] She doesn't like Dolly
[09:56] that's why your father is showing haste, this time Maheen has crossed all the limits
[10:02] mom, please don't worry. God willing, everything will be fine
[10:06] anyways, don't you worry. Everything is fine now over here
[10:09] tell me, how are the preparations going on over there for the wedding?
[10:12] mom, the work is quite a lot
[10:15] you tell me, when are you guys coming?
[10:18] yes yes, we are coming for sure. In fact, Manzoor was saying that we'll stay with you for 2 days
[10:23] really?
[10:26] yes, I am telling the truth
[10:28] in fact, your father was saying that he'll talk to your father-in-law to send you along with us
[10:34] after all, you have to do you preparations too over here
[10:40] yes mom
[11:10] Greetings mom!
Greetings!
[11:14] where have you gone?
[11:15] I have gone to the parlor. Why, do you have any work?
[11:18] why did you go alone? You should have taken Mirha along with you
[11:21] have you forgotten, you have house arrested her
[11:24] oh yes... how can I forget that. Oh God, she got me so much humiliated in front of Zara
[11:30] what she must be thinking
[11:33] So, you shall also insult her
[11:36] what do you mean by this?
[11:38] nothing
[11:39] I was just saying, if you had to go out then you should have asked me. I would have accompanied you, why did you go alone?
[11:46] what's wrong? Have I gone outside for the first time?
[11:48] you haven't gone for the first time
[11:50] but you are about to get married, try to sit at home for a few days
[11:56] your granny didn't used to let me go to the terrace even
[12:00] she had made me sit at home for almost a week's time
[12:05] oh mom, these are old school thoughts. Nothing as such happen nowadays
[12:10] really? Do these Djinn & evil eye changes with time?
[12:15] dear, there are evil eyes which affect girls. Specially the brides
[12:20] honestly, sometimes I feel that you should be sitting at some shrine
[12:24] oh God forgive me, its totally useless to talk to you
[12:28] I was joking...
[12:31] oh mom, look at my hands they look so pale. At least, you can apply some mask
[12:36] I will make it tonight, and will apply you tomorrow. Your skin will start glowing
[12:42] would you like to drink tea?
[12:43] yes, make me a good cup of tea
[12:45] let me bring it
[12:46] my dear child... 
[13:15] what are you doing?
[13:16] I don't want to stay here, drop me to my house
[13:18] but Maheen, what happened? Why are you so angry?
[13:21] as I said, I won't stay here for a minute
[13:23] Maheen, why are you being so angry? Its not good for your health
[13:26] why don't you go & ask your mom? Why she doesn't leave me alone!
[13:32] what did mom said now?
[13:33] She was taunting me. She was saying that I've kept you away from a child's happiness since so many years
[13:40] well, she haven't said anything wrong though
[13:43] even I want the same that we shall have a family
[13:46] so, am I only at fault for this?
[13:48] when did I say that?
[13:50] but you want to say that, right?
[13:52] I didn't mean that, what's wrong with you?
[13:54] I know it very well, that how people like you treat their wives when they are unable to give birth to children
[14:00] enough Maheen!
[14:03] every men desires for a child
[14:06] and today our relation is suffering because of your negative thinking
[14:10] you want to leave this house, right?
then leave
[14:13] but remember one thing very clearly
[14:16] if you leave this house today, then all the doors of this house will be closed on you forever
[14:24] do think... 
[14:26] that what do you want to do
[14:49] Mirha, I am so sorry... 
[14:52] go away from here, sister
[14:55] I never wanted to hurt you
[14:57] then what else was your intention? 
You don't care about my pain, sister
[15:01] I know what had happened with you
[15:07] you don't have any idea sister, that what had happened with me
[15:10] I know, you wanted to take revenge from me. Right?
[15:14] Revenge?
[15:16] I will take revenge from you, Mirha? What rubbish you are thinking?
[15:20] I am thinking absolutely right thing, sister
[15:22] since you never got any happiness, that's why you cannot digest my happiness as well
[15:33] you are misbehaving now
[15:34] go away! Go away, nobody had asked you to come here
[15:38] Mirha, I just came to explain you that whatever you are doing is wrong
[15:42] stop it, sister! Please, don't pretend to be so sympathetic towards me
[15:48] and kindly do knock the door before entering someone's room
[16:29] Sarwat
[16:31] Greetings!*
[16:34] for the first time it had happened today that I came in & you didn't get to know
[16:40] when did you come?
just now
[16:43] where were you lost?
[16:48] Mr. Manzoor, only if there is one thought then I shall tell you
[16:52] anyways, you can tell me any one of the thoughts that you wish to
[16:56] just now I was talking to Zara on call
[17:00] don't know why I had felt that she is worried
[17:03] also she is upset & wanted to say something
[17:06] why did you felt that way?
[17:08] whenever she says to me that "I am missing you, mom"
[17:14] it means, she is worried
[17:20] didn't you ask her?
[17:22] she never tells me anything, you know her
[17:28] anyways, since we are going to see her tomorrow. So we'll meet & ask her
[17:32] I have told her as well
[17:34] that your father & I are thinking to bring you along with us, so that you can do the preparations here
[17:41] what did she said?
[17:43] she said, ok
[17:44] okay
[17:48] did you talk to Asfa? Did she talked to Saad, any answer from their side?
[17:54] No... She couldn't speak to her, since its his new job so he must be busy
[18:02] yes, that's right but they haven't answered about such an important matter. I don't get it
[18:11] even I am worried about it. I've kept the matter of Zaini & Saad's wedding in front of her from my side
[18:17] now I am waiting for her answer
[18:20] what do you think?
[18:23] I think they wouldn't have any objection
[18:28] but yes, I also understand that Saad's consent shall also be there in this relation
[18:33] yes yes, that's right. Why he would have an objection?
[18:39] if God wills!
[19:17] Zaini, you are crazy! From where Zara came in between?
[19:20] She had always been in between us, Saad
[19:24] and this reality can never change
[19:30] leave my hand
listen to me
[19:32] I said leave my hand. 
Saad, leave my hand!
[20:07] No, its not like that.
[20:09]  Life had become so weird
[20:11] somewhere or the other there are tensions in life
[20:13] what's wrong Saad, you seem quite worried to me. Is everything alright?
[20:19] I miss you a lot
[20:22] I wish you had been here, then there wouldn't be any problem in life
[20:33] every men desires for a child
[20:36] and today our relation is suffering because of your negative thinking
[20:41] you want to leave this house, right?
then leave
[20:44] but remember one thing very clearly
[20:47] if you leave this house today, then all the doors of this house will be closed on you forever
[21:08] how are you, Maheen?
[21:10] what am I asking, how you must be
[21:13] I heard that you've gone back to your in-laws house
[21:18] anyways its good, I've sent this card specially to you
[21:22] as you don't have to come alone anymore
[21:25] I hope that you'll come for sure
[21:28] oh God what had happened to me, why you won't come?
[21:33] you should also see that what a good suitor I have got
[21:38] ok then, I will wait for you
[21:58] Mahi, I have come to talk about something important to you. What are you doing in your phone since so long?
[22:03] I am showing you something, wait a second
[22:08] look at this, how does this card looks?
[22:11] what is it?
[22:12] we have to invite few people, I would have called & invited them
[22:16] from where this card came in between, what was the need of it?
[22:18] you don't know what is needed where & when. You know nothing!
[22:23] I don't understand your words. Don't know what rubbish you utter
[22:29] there is no need to think too much about me
[22:32] just let me fulfill my desires
[22:35] now you'll see how they'll be jealous
[22:38] its looking good, right?
[22:40] the card is good, but where are you setting the fire?
[22:43] over there... in Karachi
[22:50] ok listen, I am forwarding it to you. Send it to the people in Karachi as well
[22:58] send it
Okay

[24:15] I cannot accept the responsibility of someone else's child, I am not ready for it
[24:26] have you ever thought
[24:28] what will happen to us?
[24:32] who will be our support in our old age?
[24:35] until now God is our support, He will be our support in the future too
[24:40] and we aren't the first husband & wife who doesn't have kids. There are many couples in this world who doesn't have kids

[25:39] I am not coming, mom
[25:40] there is no need to talk rubbish with me, got it?
[25:45] if you will talk much, then I will tell your antics to your father
[25:50] mom, at least listen to me once. He is a nice guy
[25:54] Don't you dare to take that guy's name from your tongue
[25:58] tomorrow is your sister's wedding, your aunt will be here. If you'll make any spectacle in front of her
[26:04] then no body will be as bad as me, I am telling you!
[26:08] quickly come outside, enough of your tantrums
[26:33] its good that you came, else I was about to call you

[27:21] but sister, only a few days have passed after Adeel's demise

[27:33] then we thought to talk to my brother after gathering some courage

[27:44] I thought, as I have to go there so now I will discuss it after going there

You've called after so many days
[36:50] yes, actually I was so busy that I hardly got any time
[36:54] you tell me, how are you doing?
[36:56] I am absolutely fine
[36:57] See, I didn't had an idea that both of us are about to become relatives
[37:04] I was about to call you
[37:26] Zaini, are you ready?
[37:28] yes

[38:01] you don't have to do much work, we are here & we'll handle everything
[38:05] come, go check Mahi whether she is ready or not
[38:23] are you still upset with me?
[38:30] I'm sorry
[38:32] I was angry at that time, that's why
[38:36] you were angry, huh!
[38:38] so does it mean that you've got a certificate to misbehave with me?
[38:44] Ok I am saying sorry, now spit your anger
[38:49] drink your tea, as its getting cold
[38:50] let it be
[38:52] here my wife's anger isn't cooling down, and you are worried about the tea
[38:55] it cannot happen, because you've become habitual of taking out someone else's anger on me
[39:01] I'm sorry! I promise, next time you can take out all of your anger on me
[39:08] I came early from office today just because of you
[39:10] since its your cousin's wedding, so lets go there
[39:13] I don't want to go anywhere
[39:15] why? But you were saying that she is your close relative
