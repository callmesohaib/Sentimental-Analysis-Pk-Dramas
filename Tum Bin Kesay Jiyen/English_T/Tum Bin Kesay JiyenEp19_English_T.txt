[00:21] Mom, she was telling you that her mother has taught her how to respect and obey elders.
[00:26] But you couldn't teach your children anything.
[00:29] That's why, at the same time Adeel was arguing with you that Zara won't put off flowers.
[00:34] Do you remember that?
[00:36] She has taunted and humiliated you.
[00:39] I wanted everything to stop.
[00:43] Zara stays with me and she may not go anywhere.
[00:49] It's really strange.
[00:52] But I didn't want Zara to get married.
[00:55] My dad was against such friendships. They should be careful.
[01:01] Such friendships are not good.
[01:04] But no one thinks that way these days.
[01:07] Saad and Zara have very good friendship.
[01:09] They roam around all the time and do whatever they want but no one says anything.
[01:32] I am telling you Mr. Ahmed that if anything happens to my son then I won't leave your niece.
[01:40] She is doing some weird things.
[01:43] I never heard anything like that.
[01:45] It's unwise from your side.
[01:48] It's not poor Zara's fault.
[01:51] Oh poor.
[01:53] So she is poor soul.
[01:55] She argues with me in every matter.
[02:00] My children never argued with me as much your niece has argued with me.
[02:05] I am telling you that stop her otherwise someday.
[02:09] I am thinking that when will you keep quiet.
[02:14] If you will stop talking then I will tell you that why have I asked you to come here.
[02:19] OK
[02:21] Tell me.
[02:23] Go ahead, your words must be more important.
[02:26] More important than my insult.
[02:29] I don't know why you keep sticking on your insult.
[02:35] I am about to talk about our honor.
[02:39] I took Mr. Tasadduq to property dealer regarding his plot.
[02:45] I met Mr. Noor Alam there.
[02:49] Which Noor Alam?
[02:51] The same Noor Alam which was our neighbor in our old neighborhood.
[02:55] Yes.
[02:56] Hadn't he shifted to Karachi?
[02:58] Yes, he shifted to Karachi but he has shifted back here three years ago.
[03:03] He was asking about all of you.
[03:05] Did you ask about sister-in-law?
Yes.
[03:09] She has passed away.
[03:11] Oh my God. When did that happen?
[03:14] It's been a long time.
[03:19] It's been a long time since they shifted to Karachi and we didn't meet with them
[03:22] and now they are shifted back here three years ago.
[03:24] Anyways, he was talking about proposal.
For Mirha?
[03:30] Let me complete my sentence.
[03:33] I am sick of your habit to interrupt me.
[03:38] I was just asking Mr. Ahmed. What's wrong with you.
[03:42] No, he wasn't talking about Mirha's proposal, he was talking about Mahi's proposal.
[03:49] For Mahi?
[03:54] Did you call me dad?
[03:57] Yes.
[04:00] Aren't you busy? Can we talk?
[04:03] Why are you talking like this dad?
[04:05] It's the way to talk. Right?
[04:09] No, I was cooking food for Ali because he has to leave at 1:00 AM
[04:16] OK then cook food, we will talk later.
[04:20] Is there something important dad?
[04:24] Yes it is that's why I asked about your busyness.
[04:28] We will talk later.
[04:31] OK.
[04:32] Have you invited Dolly on dinner by calling her?
[04:39] No, we didn't discuss any such thing.
[04:43] She is future daughter-in-law of this house.
[04:46] Ali is going to Islamabad so she must be invited on dinner. It's understood.
[04:54] I didn't talk to her. Maybe Ali talked to her or maybe mom talked to her.
[05:03] OK ask them and if they haven't talked to her then call her and invite her on dinner.
[05:08] You are Ali's elder sister and he will feel good that you have invited his future wife.
[05:13] Relations become strong by doing such things.
[05:16] Right dad.
Good girl, do your work.
[05:35] So why are you so surprised?
[05:39] Can't someone bring proposal for Mahi?
[05:42] No, it can come.
[05:45] But
[05:46] As per my knowledge, he had only one son and he went to London
[05:52] And he was younger than Mahi.
[05:55] And I heard that he got married to an English girl.
[05:58] No, he was talking about his nephew Zaviar, son of sister Gul.
[06:05] Didn't sister Gul get divorced?
[06:07] Yes she got divorced but she got married again after that.
[06:12] And his second husband refused to accept her son.
[06:19] So brother Noor has brought up Zaviar.
[06:23] Oh I see.
[06:26] So what did you say?
[06:29] I asked him to come here and meet us.
[06:33] But before his visit, I want you to get Mahi's consent.
[06:42] There is no need to talk to Mahi. You talked to him then it's OK.
[06:46] Mahi won't say anything.
[06:48] I am surprised that you are talking about Mahi and saying this to me.
[06:54] It would be better to ask Mahi. At least I will be satisfied.
[07:00] Talk to me without taunting sometime.
[07:05] I swear, it doesn't make any difference.
[07:08] And you also talk thoughtfully without any argument.
[07:14] It will make difference. I swear.
OK, as you wish.
[07:20] I will talk to Mahi.
[07:26] She doesn't think anything.
[07:30] I don't know when will she become wise.
[07:39] What did you say? You talked to him about proposal.
[07:45] Well, I met him so he told me that he is finding a proposal for her daughter.
[07:55] So I talked to him about Zaviar's proposal.
[07:57] How can you do that without any know how?
Well.
[08:03] That's strange. He is my old neighbor from my old neighborhood.
[08:12] We left that neighborhood after Malka's death.
[08:16] And you see, I met him today.
[08:20] It's God's will.
[08:22] Just leave it.
[08:23] I won't marry Zaviar to any unknown family.
[08:27] I admit that I have no such relation with Zaviar like your late wife had with him.
[08:31] But I always treated him like my children
[08:34] He is like a son to me.
[08:36] And I am telling you very clearly that I will chose bride for my son myself.
[08:40] Yes I agree that you love Zaviar like your own children but I am also his uncle.
[08:49] So I will think good for him.
[08:51] I have just talked about proposal.
[08:55] I didn't fix his marriage.
[08:57] It will be fixed when Zaviar will like that girl.
[09:06] And please no more discussion on this topic.
[09:13] You have to go to see that girl in any case.
[09:27] Zenny, did you tell Saad about Ali's departure.
[09:32] No, I didn't tell him.
[09:34] Why? Why didn't you tell him?
[09:39] I didn't think that it is important to tell him.
[09:42] OK, tell him now and also call Dolly. Dad asked me to invite them on dinner.
[09:50] And this quantity of rice will not be sufficient so add one more cup of rice in it.
[09:56] And bring meat as well.
Right.
[10:10] He was not his best friend but he is his old neighbor.
[10:15] I think there is no harm in meeting them once.
[10:19] We can't get a clear picture in only one meeting.
[10:22] And truly speaking, I don't want to marry.
[10:25] Hey, what are you talking about?
[10:28] God accepts our words. Just repent.
[10:32] And listen, you won't say any such thing again. Right?
[10:37] Some people married twice or thrice.
[10:41] And they are keen to marry for one more time.
[10:44] You only got married once.
[10:47] And that was not your fault.
[10:49] So why would you get punished for that?
[10:51] But that was my mistake mom.
[10:55] You advised me so much and forbade me so much.
[11:00] But I didn't listen to anyone.
OK.
[11:04] You won't discuss this again at all.
[11:06] OK, that was your mistake and you admitted your mistake.
[11:10] It's enough.
[11:12] So will you get punished for that one mistake.
[11:15] If our inner self is good then we feel ashamed on our mistake.
[11:22] Hey, why are you feeling ashamed.
[11:24] Those shameless persons should be ashamed who didn't give my daughter her real worth.
[11:29] Now, agree with me
[11:31] Just leave this and agree with me.
[11:36] You got married once with your choice so get married this time with our choice.
[11:40] God is very merciful and you will see that He will do everything better.
[11:47] OK
[11:49] As you wish.
[11:52] Parents don't make any wrong decision for their children.
[11:56] Maybe there is something better for me in this.
[11:58] May you get my life. You made me happy.
[12:04] May God bless every parent with a daughter like you.
[12:08] Ameen
[12:11] You don't have to worry at all. Everything will be alright.
[12:16] But remember one thing.
Hmm
[12:18] Strictly forbid Zara that don't discuss this matter with her family.
[12:22] We will inform them when marriage will be fixed.
[12:24] You don't have to worry about it at all.
[12:27] We will send your wedding card to Sarwat's house.
[12:32] And I won't let that cursed girl know about it.
[12:34] Her evil sight may effect you.
[12:36] She is cursed. She can say something bad.
[12:40] Let me tell you dad about it. Right.
[13:02] Hello. Hello.
[13:08] Hello.
[13:10] Zenny, can you hear me?
[13:12] Yes I can.
[13:15] OK.
[13:20] Say something, you have called me.
[13:24] Don't you want to say anything to me?
[13:27] No, you have called me Zenny.
[13:32] Brother Ali is going back so dad asked me to tell you and he has invited your family for dinner today.
[13:40] Oh so you have called me on your dad's advice.
[13:44] I was thinking that...
Maheen asked me to call you.
[13:48] Dad didn't ask me.
So, it's the same thing.
[13:51] Why didn't you call me by yourself.
[13:54] And I am unable to understand that why are you angry with me?
[14:01] Where is Dolly? I want to talk to her.
[14:04] What will you say to her?
[14:06] I will invite her for dinner.
[14:08] May I know the reason for this formality?
[14:13] I am asking something from you.
[14:14] OK, I won't get formal.
[14:16] You tell her yourself. OK. Bye.
Bye.
[14:21] Indeed God protects us. There is no second opinion in this.
[14:27] I have to make arrangements for dinner. We will talk later. Bye.
Bye.
[14:48] Zara. Only she can help me.
[14:55] Dolly.
Yes brother.
[14:57] Listen, Ali is going back today so Zenny called me, they have invited us for dinner today.
[15:04] So you go there, I won't go there.
[15:07] What do you mean by that?
[15:10] Brother, I don't want to get humiliated.
[15:14] You are taunting me.
[15:17] Why? Why did you think that way?
[15:20] Do they do this to you?
[15:22] What are you talking about Dolly?
[15:25] I was talking about myself.
[15:27] But if you have felt bad about it then it means that you get treated in same way.
[15:32] OK just leave it and tell me when will you get ready.
[15:35] Brother I won't go there. Please don't insist.
[15:37] Don't do this Dolly. I am saying this because of Ali.
[15:42] Your issue is with Maheen not with Ali. Ali is going back
[15:45] and he will mind if you won't go there.
[15:47] Brother I will go to that house after marriage only because of Ali.
[15:51] I have told Ali clearly that
[15:53] if he can't ask his family to give me respect then he should re-think.
[15:56] I don't want to get humiliated,
[15:59] I am sitting here in my house very respectfully and peacefully.
[16:02] It's the limit.
Dolly.
[16:32] That's really wonderful from your side.
[16:34] I mean, your black tea was magical.
[16:37] I drank once and my fever went away.
May God keep you like this for ever.
[16:44] And with you.
Ameen.
[16:59] Who is calling?
[17:05] Guess who.
It's Saad.
[17:07] Let me tell him that what are you saying about him.
OK tell him.
[17:11] I am not scared from your family.
[17:13] That's good, you shouldn't be afraid.
[17:16] Hello Saad, how are you?
Greetings.
[17:19] Leave me, tell me about yourself. How are you?
[17:21] Me? I won't tell you anything.
[17:24] Where were you? You didn't call me once.
[17:27] Everyone talks to me except you.
[17:30] Nowhere, I am busy these days that's why I couldn't call you.
[17:33] Oh so you were busy that's why you didn't call me.
[17:35] I am busy now and I have no time so we will talk later.
[17:39] Listen to me.
[17:41] I want to discuss something important with you.
[17:43] So you have called me for an important discussion.
[17:46] You didn't call me because of me. You are so mean. By the way you were like this.
[17:52] Tell me what's the problem?
[17:54] No, this is not the case. Actually, Zenny is angry with me because of you.
[18:01] What are you talking about Saad? It's very useless thing.
[18:05] Why would Zenny angry with you because of me.
[18:07] You must have done something that's why she is angry with you
[18:11] and you are blaming me for no reason.
[18:13] I am not blaming you, I am just telling you.
[18:17] I talked to her but she minded that and since then her behavior got changed.
[18:21] Saad she is your fiancee, she can think anything if you will say such things in front of her.
[18:30] You should think before saying something. You talk without thinking.
[18:45] Just think about your words. What did you say to Zenny?
[18:50] That you don't talk to me because if you will talk to me then you will want to meet me and see me.
[18:57] And you didn't say farewell to me on my wedding day because you didn't like that I am going.
[19:02] Now tell me, is this the right thing to do.
[19:05] If you will say such things in front of her then she will mind that.
[19:08] Who says such things about his friends.
Which friends?
[19:11] I have no other friend except you.
[19:13] OK, you don't have any friend except me. But Zenny
[19:18] Zenny is your fiancee and she will feel bad if she will listen these things.
[19:23] But why is she feeling bad about it.
[19:26] Why is she objecting on our friendship?
[19:28] Saad, don't be foolish.
[19:31] Zenny has no objection on our friendship but you should think about your words.
[19:35] Other people don't give same importance to our friendship which we give.
[19:40] They won't see us in that way.
[19:43] I understand you and you understand me.
[19:48] You shouldn't say such things. You should be careful.
[19:52] And you shouldn't say such things in front of Zenny. She will feel bad about it.
[19:55] And she has minded that.
[19:58] Please don't say any such thing in front of her again.
[20:02] Right? I am in kitchen so I will talk to you later.
[20:06] OK Zara.
[20:08] You won't understand my feelings.
[20:10] Good bye.
Good bye.
[20:18] He is crazy.
[20:34] No Zara.
[20:36] Your friendship is very important for me.
[20:41] If your friendship with Saad can hurt Zenny then
[20:45] Why can't it hurt Adeel?
[20:48]  I didn't even think about it.
[20:50] You have given me your weak point, idiot girl.
[20:58] I want to say one thing.
[21:02] Actually, Mahi want that Zara shouldn't know about this proposal.
[21:08] But why?
I don't know, Mahi wants it.
[21:14] There is no harm if we will hide this from Zara.
[21:24] Mr. Ahmed.
[21:27] I have talked to Mahi and she is convinced.
[21:30] You can invite brother Noor Alam.
[21:32] I told you that he will come on Saturday?
[21:35] On Saturday?
Hmm
[21:37] This Saturday?
[21:38] It's day after tomorrow.
[21:40] You should have informed me earlier.
[21:43] How many persons will come. We have to make arrangements.
[21:46] I don't know how many persons will come. I will ask when he will call me.
[21:51] OK.
[21:54] I want to say one more thing.
[21:56] Actually, Mahi wants that Zara shouldn't know about this proposal.
[22:04] But why?
I don't know, Mahi wants it.
[22:10] There is no harm if we will hide this from Zara.
[22:14] And what's wrong in telling her?
I don't know.
[22:17] There is no harm in telling her nor in hiding from her.
[22:20] Mahi told me that she wants it.
[22:24] If there is no harm in telling her nor in hiding from her then we should tell her
[22:29]  because she is part of this family.
[22:31] And every member of family should know everything.
[22:35] You exaggerate the matter.
[22:40] The point is that Mahi doesn't want to let Zara know about this proposal.
[22:47] If she doesn't want then we shouldn't tell her.
[22:50] There must be some reason behind this.
[22:52] OK, let's assume that Mahi has some reason but which reason do you have?
[22:58] I have this reason that Mahi doesn't want it 
[23:01] and I don't want to make Mahi angry.
[23:04] She will refuse if she will irritate.
[23:07] You know about her nature.
[23:09] I will tell Zara later.
[23:12] Anyways, she won't have any objection on this proposal.
[23:15] Why can't you make Mahi understand right now which you will do to Zara later 
[23:20] that what she wants is wrong.
[23:24] Yes, I can't do that.
[23:25] I she will listen to you then you advise her.
[23:29] I was just saying that if she got irritated and refused to marry
[23:35] Then no one will be able to convince her for this marriage
[23:39]  and you know it very well because you are her father.
[23:44] There will be no harm if Zara won't know about it. 
[23:48] I just want to fix this marriage without any trouble.
[23:53] Do whatever you want. I told you about my opinion.
[24:06] I am unable to understand her.
[24:09] Dolly what happened to you. 
[24:12] There is no certainty of life and death of a person.
[24:14] And what do you want
[24:16] That I die with this desire that I couldn't marry my daughter in my lifetime.
[24:22] Mom, I didn't say any such thing. Why are you so scared?
[24:26] I have asked Ali to give me my right.
[24:29] Don't I have this much right that my in-laws will respect me?
[24:32] Why are you mentioning your in-laws?
[24:35] It's about Maheen. She is married and she will go to her house one day.
[24:41] The other members of your in-laws family didn't say anything to you.
[24:45] And look at Ali, he takes very good care of you.
[24:50] Why are you worried if there isn't any problem between both of you.
[24:55] Mom, I am not worried.
[24:57] I have no issue with anyone.
[25:00] I don't say anything about sister Maheen, it doesn't make any difference to me whether she goes back to her in-laws house or not.
[25:07] I talked to Ali.
[25:10] So Ali should have kept this matter between me and him.
[25:13] But if I am hearing about this matter then it means that he has told everyone about that.
[25:18] This is not fair mom.
[25:19] It's a matter between two persons so why did he tell everyone. 
[25:23] What does it mean? Are you getting my point?
[25:26] So it means that he shared your complain with Maheen.
[25:32] And you know it very well that what must have Maheen's reaction.
[25:36] But even then he talked to her so what can it mean.
[25:41] Mom, I don't know.
[25:44] Don't try to convince me.
[25:51] Let me see.
[26:11] Hmm, you are cutting cucumber.
[26:13] I have told you so many times that don't disturb me while I am working in kitchen. Put it back.
[26:17] Put cucumber back Zenny.
[26:19] Has anything happened?
[26:21] What did I do?
[26:23] Why are you talking to me in this tone?
[26:26] You are my sister. Right?
[26:27] Hmm, so that's why I am trying to make you habitual.
[26:30] So that when Dolly will ride on your head someday then you won't have any problem.
[26:37] What do you mean by that? I didn't get your point.
[26:40] Yes, you are a kid and you are so innocent that you don't know anything and I have to tell you about everything.
[26:47] And then you will backbite against me in future. Am I right Zenny?
[26:52] Why are you creating these fake stories?
[26:56] Why would I backbite against you in front of someone?
[27:00] Oho, don't think about backbiting.
[27:04] And my dear daughter, tell me that why mom and dad have gone there to appease Dolly?
[27:10] She is just increasing her worth for no reason
[27:13]  and everyone in this house is just a fool.
[27:15] She has told us very clearly that until we won't request her then she won't come here.
[27:22] Yes, I am bad, I am very bad.
[27:25] But what about mom and dad Zenny?
[27:27] Why is she humiliating them? What will she get by doing that?
[27:33] What happened to you? There won't be any such thing.
[27:35] And Dolly don't know that mom and dad have gone there to appease her.
[27:39] Rather she will be happy to see them.
[27:42] OK, close your door when you will have to cry someday.
[27:46] I don't want to hear you cry. I will feel your pain for no reason.
[27:50] Because when there was time to listen to me then my own sister didn't listen to me.
[27:54] And doubted me instead.
[27:57] I didn't mean that, why are you taking me wrong.
[28:01] OK, forgive me. I made a mistake by advising you.
[28:06] I won't advise you again. Eat these green vegetables.
[28:10] Maybe your brain start to work after eating these.
[28:37] Zara, is pudding ready?
[28:39] Yes.
Let me taste it.
[28:42] Do you know that your in-laws are very conscious about dessert.
[28:46] Zara.
[28:49] Wow Zara, the pudding is very delicious.
[28:53] Now I knew that why does my brother roam around you like a crazy man.
[28:58] You make good dessert as well as say sweet things.
[29:02] So it means that you are convinced.
[29:05] That Zara is perfect for me.
[29:07] What do you want to say?
[29:09] You are saying as if I was against your marriage with her.
[29:15] I always liked Zara for you.
[29:18] It's very delicious and bring it quickly.
[29:27] What was that?
[29:30] You told me that whatever you will cook here you will give me first.
[29:34] Yes.
[29:36] So?
You didn't fulfill your promise.
[29:39] You gave this pudding to Mahi first.
[29:41] I promised you that I will give you first but Mahi has just tasted it.
[29:47] So my promise is still in tact.
[29:50] Wow.
[29:52] You are so intelligent.
[29:55] Tell me that you were intelligent from beginning or is this effect of my companionship?
[30:01] Please maintain some distance from me.
[30:04] Because this is kitchen not your bedroom 
[30:06] and if Mahi saw us then she will say that Zara's companionship is the reason behind this shamelessness.
[30:11] So it means that you have understood Mahi's nature.
[30:13] Yes of course. You called me. Did you want anything?
[30:18] Yes I wanted to tell you about something but I will tell you after a while.
[30:21] But at the moment give me pudding.
But you can't eat pudding at the moment.
[30:25] But why can't I eat?
[30:26] Because I want my reward for making pudding from you separately.
[30:29] I won't convince on honey moon tickets.
[30:33] Yes I know about that because I received the tickets because you were not at home.
[30:38] This is not fair.
[30:39] I thought that I will...
What did you think?
[30:41] Whatever you want to think, you should think in your room.
[30:45]  Kitchen is not right place to think. Go and let me do my work.
[30:50] And what if I don't go then?
[30:54] So.
[30:55] Then I will hold your hand and will forcefully take you to your room so that I can do my work.
[31:01]  Don't come here again.
[31:15] Oho.
Switch off TV.
[31:19] Look at this. You will give this to Zara.
[31:24] Are you mad Mahi?
[31:27] Who gives gold jewelry on this ritual.
[31:30] I will only give her five hundred rupees. That's it.
[31:34] But I don't have any five hundred note. I have only one thousand notes.
[31:38] Give me five hundred note.
Mom, you will give her this one.
[31:42] I am telling you that we have to show off sometime.
[31:45] Everyone should know that you have accepted Zara happily. 
[31:50] Try to understand my point.
[31:53] I have accepted her so what else should I do?
[31:57] Do I hang my self upside down to show off?
[32:00] I am not saying that.
[32:02] We have to show off.
[32:05] When you will give it to her then if Zara will have any problem with you and me ever 
[32:10] and she complain in front of Adeel and dad.
[32:14] Then she will definitely think once.
[32:17] No, I will give this set to you on your marriage.
[32:24] I won't give this to her at all.
[32:26] Put it back in cupboard.
[32:28] She doesn't deserve to wear this set.
[32:32] Is it possible that you understand my point?
[32:35] Yes, I don't understand your point.
[32:36] Bring five hundred notes for me.
I don't have any change.
[32:40] Give thousand rupee note and ask her to give you two five hundred notes.
[32:43] You are so mean.
So what should I say?
[32:48] If you want to fall then fall completely. I think you shouldn't give her anything.
[32:52] OK.
[32:53] I won't give her anything. At least I won't give her this set.
[32:58] No matter whatever you do.
[33:00] That's right. I won't give her five hundred rupees now.
[33:04] It's the limit. You spoiled my drama.
[33:11] Why are you staring at me? You spoiled my drama.
[33:33] Zenny why are you so sad?
No, you had to go back.
[33:38] So why are you so sad?
[33:41] My face is like this.
Don't say this Zenny.
[33:45] When you were born then everyone said that you are like me.
[33:55] Zenny, won't you tell your brother?
[33:59] Nothing, I am just tired. Nothing else.
Tiredness and you.
[34:05] I have heard this first time from you.
[34:08] Tell me what happened? Has sister Maheen said something?
[34:13] Why?
[34:15] Did she had to say something?
[34:17] I am asking you.
[34:19] No, she didn't say anything.
[34:23] Sister Maheen didn't say anything.
[34:26] Has Saad said anything? Is he alright?
[34:30] Yes, he is fine.
[34:34] Then what's the matter?
[34:42] I am not fine.
[34:47] I washed some of your shirts and those are upstairs, I will bring those.
[34:54] But
[34:55] Zenny listen to me. Zenny
[35:10] Wow, it's very delicious.
[35:16] The food was very tasty and this dessert is out of this world.
[35:23] She deserves a reward for that.
[35:32] Take it my child.
[35:36] Uncle, there is no need for this.
[35:40] What are you talking about. Take it.
[35:44] It's happiness. Don't refuse.
[35:47] If you want to give me then don't give me this much amount.
[35:54] You are absolutely like your mother.
[35:57] Come on, take it.
[36:04] Thank you uncle.
[36:13] Are you happy now?
[36:16] She took money.
[36:22] You are right.
[36:25] She is absolutely like her mother.
[36:29] Just like she doesn't stop you spending your money on her.
[36:34] In the same way she accepted amount from you.
[36:45] That's right.
[36:47] The way sisters have faith in their brothers in the same way nieces have faith in their uncles.
[36:55] By the way mom, I don't remember that our uncle has ever sent us Eid gift.
[37:04] You should keep quiet Mirha. You have some issues with uncles.
[37:10] By the way, do you remember that advertisement.
[37:16] In which an elderly uncle says that there is magic in our daughter-in-law's hands.
[37:23] Do you remember that in that advertisement the girl makes pudding first time
[37:26]  so it means that we can also say
[37:28] Our daughter-in-law is a witchcraft.
[37:39] What happened? Why are you angry? I am just joking.
[37:43] And when she makes black tea for you then your fever goes away.
[37:46] And when she makes pudding then everyone praises her.
[37:49]  It means that there is some magic.
[37:52] Am I right mom. No one else can do this magic.
[37:56] Hmm.
Be careful while choosing words Mahi.
[38:02] You just say without thinking.
[38:05] You forget that your father has taught you to speak.
[38:25] Adeel, you discussed about your honey moon so what's your plan for that?
[38:31] Yes dad, our tickets are confirmed.
[38:37] Where are you going?
[38:39] Where are we going?
[38:41] That is a surprise.
[38:46] OK that's good.
