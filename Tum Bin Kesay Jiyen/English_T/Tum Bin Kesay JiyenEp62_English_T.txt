[00:12] You will have to tell the truth to everyone.
[00:16]  Whatever you did to my sister-in-law, now you will tell everyone that it was not her fault.
[00:21] She can never become a mother.
[00:27] Zara has gone back to her house.
[00:32] Yes
[01:02] Mirha
[01:05] the police has arrested Aqib
[01:08] don't you worry at all, he will get strict punishment
[01:14] thank you brother Saad
[01:16] thank you so much!
[01:30] did you talk to the doctor, how is he?
[01:35] he will be fine, mom
[01:37] if God wills, he will be fine
[01:43] mom, I will be back in a minute
[01:49] I'm coming in a while
[02:18] Zara, we got to know about brother Ahmed's health
[02:23] but dear, we didn't had the courage to face his wife
[02:29] Sir, I respect you a lot
[02:32] but whatever you guys did with Mahi
[02:37] none of us will forgive you for that ever
[02:42] I agree that aunt & Mahi hid the truth from you
[02:47] but you could have come to our house, & discussed it
[02:50] the way you have made my uncle's spectacle, & got him humiliated by not bringing the wedding procession
[02:56] who will repent for it?
[02:58] today, in whatever condition my uncle is. Both of you are responsible for it
[03:03] you are right, dear
[03:06] but what we could do?
[03:08] the situation was as such at that time
[03:12] that we couldn't understand anything and...
[03:15] and we did such a big injustice with Mahi
[03:20] I don't have any complaint with you, but with him
[03:24] you had said "yes" for this proposal
[03:27] if you couldn't nurture this relation, then why you did false promises with Mahi?
[03:33] its not only one person's duty to handle the relation
[03:36] its everyone's right to do second or third marriage
[03:41] and if a person is not comfortable with its past, and doesn't want to tell you
[03:45] then you shouldn't force that person & leave that matter
[03:50] Instead, you had left Mahi
[03:54] that's why I came here to apologize to all of you
[03:57] you shouldn't apologize to me but Mahi
[04:00] you had hurt her, you are her criminal
[04:04] I will apologize to all of you
[04:06] but before that you have to tell me
[04:09] that if you didn't get to know this matter from our house, then who told you this?
[04:23] No... No
[04:26] what are you saying?
[04:28] its true dad, we are being deceived. Mahi is divorced
[04:32] her family hid such a big reality from us
[04:35] but dear, there is a possibility that whoever told you this must be telling a lie
[04:42] its impossible dad! Zara's sister Maheen had personally told me this
[04:48] now tell me, do you still think this matter could be fake?
[04:52] really!
[04:54] it means that Zara also hid this matter from me
[04:58] dad, there might be so many things which we don't know
[05:01] and after talking from Maheen, I had realized that don't know how many more matters of Mahi she is hiding
[05:07] dad, do something & stop this wedding. This proposal isn't good for Zaviyar
[05:17] Maheen, your elder sister...  told this matter to us
[05:24] then how come we could have ignored it?
[05:29] yes!
[05:31] but we did a mistake that we couldn't come & talk to you on this matter
[05:39] and dear, that's why we are here today to apologize to all of you & to tell the truth
[05:55] Zara!
[05:58] uncle's condition..
[05:59] what!
[06:13] are you Mr. Ahmed's family?
yes yes
[06:16] we tried our level best, but we couldn't save him
[06:19] I'm sorry, he is no more
[06:21] No...  no
[06:39] Zara!
[06:42] what happened?
[06:44] uncle is no more, my dear
[06:46] my brother left us
[06:49] but you were saying that he'll be fine
[06:54] Zara...
[06:57] your dad had left us
[07:07] mom!
[07:11] mom, please compose yourself
[07:13] brother...
mom, please compose yourself
[07:20] your father has left us alone
[07:37] my brother...
[07:59] mom, there is a bad news from Hyderabad
[08:02] oh God, what happened?
[08:04] uncle Ahmed died
[08:06] "Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return"
[08:09] may God give him a highest place in the paradise
[08:12] Amen
[08:17] how is sister Sarwat?
[08:20] she must be crying a lot, as she couldn't meet her brother in his last moments
[08:26] Ali was telling me that mom is really unwell
[08:29] her condition is so bad due to continuous crying
[08:31] neither she ate or drank anything
[08:33] even aunt Fareeda is apologizing now with everyone for her bad behavior
[08:37] what's the use of it now? The one who had to die has died already. So what's the benefit of apologizing now?
[08:41] don't know, I didn't talk to him in detail. Maybe, she regrets about something
[08:47] Thank God that she also feels regretful
[08:51] the child didn't bear something small, what not she had tolerated
[08:57] mom, I was always sympathetic towards Zara
[09:00] she has suffered a lot, don't know why all such things happens with her?
[09:03] yes, but I am happy in God's will
[09:06] what do you mean mom, I didn't get it
[09:10] Zara became my daughter-in-law, and God had to bring her to my house
[09:15] you are right, mom
[09:17] but now both of them shall agree to live together
[09:21] they will agree
[09:23] you'll see, if God wills..
[09:25] Mom, we can say this only if Zara agrees
[09:28] what is the importance of yours or my words ?
[09:30] dear, show some patience... if God wills
[09:33] if my God wants...
[09:36] you'll see, if God willing... Zara & Saad's family will also experience good blessings
[09:42] If God wills
[09:58] compose yourself, mom
[10:34] I won't eat
[10:36] I won't eat anything
[10:40] you haven't eaten anything since yesterday, aunty
[10:43] eat little
[10:46] for my sake
[10:48] please
[11:05] mom..
[11:07] I think...
[11:09] you should go to aunty
[11:14] she needs you, please forget the past
[11:18] please
[11:54] everything is finished, Sarwat
[12:03] everything is finished
[12:05] Sarwat, please forgive me
[12:13] I had hurt your feelings so much
[12:19] I had hurt your feelings a lot
[12:23] Ahmed had explained me so many times
[12:35] but I had never agreed with him
[12:44] what shall I do, Sarwat?
[12:51] See, how God took revenge from me
[12:58] He didn't gave me a chance to apologize to my husband & son for hurting their feelings
[13:12] I couldn't apologize & both of them had left
[13:22] I am such an unlucky woman
[13:28] my husband died, my only son died
[13:36] everything is finished
[13:39] everything is finished... Sarwat, I am left alone. All Alone!
[13:46] please don't say such things, we all are with you
[13:56] my brother had respected you so much, sister
[14:01] he had never confronted you on anything wrong
[14:07] if he ever did anything against your will then...
[14:12] he did it for the betterment of this family, sister
[14:16] my brother was such a nice person
[14:20] he was such a dear brother
[14:23] you are right
[14:25] you are absolutely correct!
[14:29] I couldn't understand ever
[14:34] Sarwat, I never wanted to understand that whatever he is doing is for the betterment of this house & family
[14:48] I couldn't understand
[14:51] I always used to favor wrong things for my entire life
[14:57] I always used to falsify the truth
[15:01] I favored the lie & kept on proving the truth as wrong
[15:16] the one who had to die has died already, sister
[15:20] just pray that he gets our apologies
[15:24] and they shall be accepted, sister
I pray that God also accepts them
[15:29] my brother shall also forgive us
[15:35] forget the past
[15:39] forget?
[15:43] how can I forget that?
[15:47] how can I forget?
[15:51] Sarwat, there had been two deaths in this house within a year's time
[16:01] my only son had left me
[16:08] my husband had left me, how can I forget it?
why am I alive, why I didn't die?
[16:19] he was my sky..
[16:23] he was my land...
[16:27] I am left without any support
[16:32] I don't have anyone now
[16:36] aunt, why are you talking such hopeless things?
[16:41] your words will hurt Adeel & uncle's soul. Please don't say such things
[16:53] Zara... my child
[16:59] please forgive me
[17:02] I did a lot of injustices with you
[17:07] I did so many cruelties
[17:09] I have forgiven you, aunty
I don't have any complaint
[17:14] I don't have any complaint against you.
You haven't forgiven me?
[17:28] my Lord, please forgive me
[17:58] come in
[18:09] Mahi
[18:11] I am going to my house
[18:16] take care of yourself
[18:25] Zara
[18:34] please forgive me, Zara
[18:38] please forgive me
[18:44] I hated you so much
[18:46] so much that...
[18:51] my hatred had burnt me
[18:58] whatever I did with you
[19:02] nobody can thought of it
[19:06] my only brother...
[19:11] I had killed my only brother's child
[19:26] sit down
[19:30] Zara, I caused you so much of loss
[19:34] however, you weren't at fault
[19:40] why will you ruin my life
[19:46] I had become so mad in your hatred that..
[19:50] I had used Aqib
[19:53] and dad..
[19:59] dad...
[20:04] Zara, dad was so upset when he got to know everything
[20:09] he didn't even forgave me
[20:13] please forgive me Zara, I beg you
[20:28] please forgive me
[20:32] she had pushed me deliberately 
[20:35] she had snatched Adeel's last memorable from me
[20:38] she had snatched my baby from me, only because of you!
[20:44] not only she did this
[20:46]  in order to oust me from that house, she had alleged me of being characterless
[20:52] so that I can get defamed & can never go back to that house 
[22:41] tea
[22:46] Sawera
[22:47] yes brother?
[22:48] I can't find my file, don't know where Mahi had kept it. Can you please find it for me?
[22:53] let me check
[23:02] dear, I wanted to ask you something
[23:04] yes mom, go ahead
[23:06] had Maheen gone somewhere with her mother?
[23:10] No, she didn't
[23:12] Okay
[23:14] she is completely quiet since she came back, she isn't talking with anyone
[23:18] No, she didn't discuss any such thing with me

[23:28] shall I keep it back?
[23:31] show me, what is this
[23:35] what is this?

[24:30] Nothing
[24:40] mom... sister Maheen is here
[24:46] what happened, why all of you are looking at me like this?
[25:10] mom, why did you slap me?
[25:13] I should have slapped you long time ago, Maheen
[25:18] if I had an idea that how low you've stooped
[25:24] Why? What as such I have done, that you are making my spectacle in front of all?
[25:31] are you saying this, Mahi?
[25:34] you have made the spectacle of my life
[25:37] I had lost Adeel's house because of you!
[25:40] what rubbish you are talking? What as such I have done, Zara?
[25:45] your hatred, & jealousy took over my house as well
[25:49] my character got tainted, just because of you!
[25:53] are you in your senses? You are my sister Zara, how can I be the reason of this?
[25:58] how can I do it with you & why?
[26:01] what do you think, Mahi? What were you thinking?
[26:05] that you'll do a conspiracy to ruin someone's life & nothing wrong will happen with you!
[26:09] you will stay fine
[26:12] from the beginning of this world, every person has reap whatever he had sown
[26:19] who got the punishment of your actions?
[26:22] your own family... me
[26:24] all of us got affected by this storm
[26:28] you had called sir Alam's family to take revenge from Mahi
[26:32] and told them everything about Mahi's past
[26:35] this is a lie, I haven't done any such thing
[26:38] I know everything, sir Alam had told me everything!
[26:41] Sir Alam told me that you called Farah & told her everything about Mahi's first marriage
[26:47] yes, I had called but just to congratulate her. That's it, mom
[26:59] again you are lying
[27:01] how much more you'll lie, Maheen?
[27:03] do you know, what Mahi did with me because of you?
[27:08] how low she had gone to hurt me?
[27:12] do you know, what she did?
[27:14] she had pushed me deliberately
[27:17] she had snatched Adeel's last memorable from me
[27:20] she had snatched my baby from me, only because of you!
[27:26] not only she did this
[27:28] in order to oust me from that house, she had alleged me of being characterless
[27:33] so that I can get defamed & can never go back to that house
[27:37] its all because of you
[27:44] Zara, Mahi had pushed you?
[27:50] you had a miscarriage because you had slipped due to her push?
[27:55] oh my God!
[27:57] Zara, I kept asking you my child. I asked you to tell me what happened but you didn't uttered a single word
[28:07] you had beared everything all alone
[28:12] mom, whatever happened with me... whatever
[28:18] its all because of her. It happened with me because of her hatred
[28:23] No Zara no, its not like that. I just wanted to teach a lesson to Mahi because she used to treat you badly. That's it!
[28:32] Enough Maheen enough!
[28:34] don't utter a single word
[28:40] with how many lives you'll play?
[28:44] you don't even care about the relations
[28:48] you did such a big injustice with Mahi & Zara
[28:54] I feel ashamed while calling you my child
[28:58] dad, believe me. I didn't know that Mahi did all this with Zara
[29:04] Zara, you'll see. I won't spare Mahi
[29:07] whatever she did with you & your child, I won't spare her
[29:11] stop it Maheen, stop it!
[29:13] I beg you, for God sake please stop it
[29:18] I don't want anything from you. Neither justice nor your sympathy
[29:22] just spare me & leave me alone!
[29:25] Zara, listen to me... Zara
[29:27] dad, mom... dad, please believe me. I haven't done this intentionally
[29:35] dad, please forgive me. I will never do this again, please forgive me
[29:44] at least say something
[29:49] you got quite late in apologizing, Maheen
[29:52] today, if Zara hadn't said it then we would have never got to know
[29:58] two lives got ruined because of you
[30:03] everyone tried to explain you a lot, but you didn't listen to anyone
[30:11] Tell me, how can you sit peacefully after committing such a big sin?
[30:19] didn't you feel ashamed on your actions even once?
[30:23] don't you feel ashamed?
[30:25] I am hating you right now
[30:29] you took undue advantage of our love, girl!
[30:33] mom...
[30:35] mom, please forgive me
[30:39] please forgive me
[30:41] how?
[30:43] how shall I forgive you, & why? Why shall I forgive you?
[30:47] go away, get lost from here. Go from where you came
[30:51] go to your house & live there
[30:54] don't treat me like this, please mom
[30:58] enough!
[31:02] we don't have any other option
[31:05] today on wards we don't have any relation with you
[31:08] no dad, please...
[31:11] and all of you shall also listen to me
[31:14] if anyone from this house tried to meet her or talk to her
[31:20] then he will see my dead face
[31:24] the doors of this house are closed on you forever
[31:28] go away from here
[31:30] Ali...
[31:33] drop her to her in-laws house
[31:40] no dad, please don't do this. I will die
[31:44] how will I live without you guys?
[31:48] mom... please forgive me
[31:51] mom... mom, please forgive me
sister, lets go!
[31:56] sister, get up
please, try to explain mom
[31:58] Zaini... Zaini....
[32:33] mom
[32:40] I want to discuss something with you
[32:47] is there anything left to be heard to said, Mahi?
[32:59] that night, my wedding procession wasn't stopped by Zara
[33:09] Maheen did that
[33:14] in order to take revenge from me
[33:21] and unintentionally, I had put the entire blame on Zara
[33:28] she didn't had any fault, mom
that poor girl was innocent
[33:38] I did a very big mistake
[33:41] I did a grave mistake
[33:45] I had committed such a big sin
[33:54] your hatred & jealousy...
[33:58] ate away the happiness of this house, Mahi
[34:05] You & I are left with nothing, except for regrets
[34:14] nothing is left
[36:14] why did you hide such a big thing from me?
[36:19] I was about to tell you but...
[36:22] when you wanted to tell?
[36:24] you have made my son go crazy!
[36:27] I had realized it long time ago that I won't be able to see your child in this house
[36:31] but I was just quiet for my son's sake
[36:35] you hid such a big matter from Usama as well
[36:38] what did you get Maheen? What did you get by hiding all this from me?
[36:43] I had trusted you so much
[36:44] I had trusted you so much. I would have understood, if you would have told this to me once
[36:49] nobody was precious to me than you, Maheen
[36:52] but by hiding this matter from me, you have proved that you can never change
[36:57] I cannot trust myself anymore
[37:00] I couldn't win your trust in such a long time?
[37:07] No... I was about to tell you
[37:12] I was afraid that what if you leave me
[37:16] please forgive me, Usama
[37:19] please forgive me, Usama
[37:23] its too late now
[37:25] I don't need your clarification anymore
[37:29] please don't say this
please forgive me, Usama
[37:35] Usama...
[37:39] you have ruined my son's life
[37:42] don't know what wretched time it was that I had fixed your marriage
[37:45] mom, be quiet
[37:47] all of my desires have died
[37:52] lets go inside mom, you will get sick
[37:54] go away from my house.  
 I will see my son's pain, whenever I will see you
[37:59] go away from here!
[38:01] mom, you'll get sick. Please go inside
[38:04] go, call your brother. He has gone outside, what if he does something wrong with him
[38:09] quickly go
[38:10] mom, lets go inside
[38:49] she had pushed me deliberately
[38:53] she had snatched Adeel's last memorable from me
[38:56] She had snatched my baby from me, only because of you!
[39:01] not only she did this
[39:04] in order to oust me from that house, she had alleged me of being characterless
[39:09] so that I can get defamed & can never go back to that house
