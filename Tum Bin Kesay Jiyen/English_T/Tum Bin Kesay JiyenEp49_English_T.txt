[00:12] Uncle has strictly instructed us not to let you enter in this house alone.
[00:18] It would be better for you to leave and come back with your family.
[00:20] Who are you to stop me?
[00:24] Why do you want to play with uncle's honor?
[00:27] Who will scheme against you?
[00:30] All of us took such great care of you. We loved you.
[00:34] Why would we scheme against you?
[00:38] If my son's name has been associated with your daughter's name....
[00:43] then he should be married to her.
[00:47] Zara should be married to Zara.
[00:50] What are you saying mother?
[01:00] Enough mother, how much more will you cry? Give her water
Mom, drink water.
[01:05] Here mother, drink water.
[01:07] We can't bring back the people who are gone.
[01:09] You guys might have forgotten about Adeel...
[01:12] but I can't.
[01:16] That's what you think.
[01:18] We miss Adeel as must as you.
[01:22] Mother I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
[01:29] You guys must think that I'm insane.
[01:36] I'm not insane! What I say happens!
[01:41] I ask you not to say outside for long hours...
[01:45] Try and understand what I'm saying.
[01:50] Mother... this was all the time brother Adeel was meant to be with us for.
[01:55] You couldn't have possibly saved his life.
[01:58] Are you insane? How are you speaking to mother?
[02:01] Are you here to lessen her pain or increase it?
[02:04] It's necessary for her to accept it.
[02:07] Will you teach me between right and wrong now?
[02:12] Alright fine. Mother...
[02:15] you'll have to understand what I'm saying.
[02:18] I'll often be late from university because of extra classes.
[02:21] That doesn't meant that you'll cry about me.
[02:24] If you do this, then how will I focus on studying?
[02:28] Let her go mother. She's gotten used to being at the university.
[02:33] She likes it now.
[02:35] She won't get better, rather you should turn back two hours on your watch.
[02:41] Do you really like provoking her?
Enough of that nonsense!
[02:45] Mind you tongue, otherwise I'll snatch it off!
Enough!
[02:51] Begone!
[02:55] I don't know what's with you two. You two will never understand what a mother goes through!
[03:01] Mother...
Get away from her!
[03:06] Mother... quiet yourself.
[03:10] Keep on crying then.
[03:14] You guys don't know a mother's pain.
[03:23] Father, you can't do this.
[03:27] I promise that I will not look at Saad and will not talk to him ever again...
[03:32] but don't do this to Zaini and me.
[03:36] Listen to me father.
[03:38] I don't want to hear anything anymore.
[03:41] Nor do I want to give any opportunity.
[03:48] I cannot tolerate anymore humiliation than this.
[03:53] For a father if his daughters become his weakness...
[03:57] then that is enough for a father to be buried alive.
[04:04] Uncle what you're doing is wrong.
[04:07] The time has passed for right and wrong.
[04:12] Now there will be punishment.
[04:15] Alongside you, all of us will be punished.
[04:17] Then punish me... do whatever you want...
[04:22] strangle me... but...
[04:24] Even if you sacrifice yourself you cannot bring back the honor to this house!
[04:36] If you want your father to die, then do as you wish.
[04:41] No father...
[04:44] Brother Manzoor don't take the wrong decision out of emotions.
[04:50] Don't think of marrying Saad and Zara. Don't punish Zara!
[05:02] You played this game...
[05:05] don't talk in between.
[05:08] Anyone can think whatever they want... and they can do whatever they want.
[05:12] I cannot marry...
[05:13] Not even for your sister's happiness?
[05:19] What did you say?
[05:22] You destroyed both of my sisters' lives!
[05:27] Do you think I'll let your sister be happy?
[05:34] What nonsense are you saying?
[05:35] If you don't want this marriage to happen...
[05:38] then you can take your sister away from here.
[05:41] But remember one thing...
[05:43] this will be our last meeting.
[05:45] What's the matter with you Ali?
[05:47] Silence yourself, why are you speaking nonsense?
[05:50] Mother please, let me speak.
[05:54] Is he cares about his ego so much, then I care about my house's honor as well.
[06:00] An honorable man could go to any lengths for his sister's honor,
[06:04] even if he has to sacrifice his happiness.
[06:08] What's with you Ali? We are speaking, silence yourself.
[06:11] Father please... if he cares about his ego so much...
[06:16] then I care about my house's respect.
[06:19] What's your decision now?
[06:24] Ali... my dear this is unjust. You can't do this to my daughter!
[06:34] Brother, how can I do this to Dolly?
[06:37] Why are you dragging her into this?
Silence yourself.
[06:41] I'm not speaking with you. I'm speaking with him... answer me!
[06:46] If my sister can by punished then why not your sister?
[06:51] That's what you said, right auntie?
[06:53] If your son could get away with destroying my sisters' lives...
[06:58] then we will not take long in breaking this relationship.
[07:04] Ali...
[07:05] Don't talk to me Dolly.
[07:07] Whatever you want to say, say to your brother.
[09:05] I didn't expect this from you Ali.
[09:08] That's the only option you have now.
[09:10] If you want your sister's relationship to remain as it is, then you'll have to marry my sister.
[09:18] Saad agree... this is best for all of us.
[09:22] Saad... because of your stubbornness,  my daughter's life will be ruined.
[09:30] I beg you.... for God's sake agree to marrying Zara.
[09:40] No mother... I cannot marry her.
[09:43] Wait!
[09:45] If you're leaving, then take your sister with you.
[09:52] Otherwise I in my senses...
Ali!
[10:07] Not one more word!
[10:26] I accept it!
[12:03] What's the matter? You didn't come down for dinner.
[12:11] I don't feel like it.
[12:19] Did someone say something to you?
[12:23] No..
[12:25] Then?
[12:29] I don't know...
[12:31] Nothing seems nice.
[12:35] I don't feel like doing anything.
[12:40] Mirha told me.
[12:45] Look... if you stop eating...
[12:50] then that will bring pain to Adeel's pain.
[12:55] Don't cause yourself pain.
[12:59] What else can I do?
[13:02] What else can I do?
[13:07] I miss Adeel.
[13:14] Nothing seems nice.
[13:18] Wherever I go I see Adeel and...
Forget it..
[13:25] Forget it.
[13:29] I've forgotten everything and moved on.
[13:33] Forget it.
[13:41] I've asked for a Quran gathering at the madrassa.
[13:46] The children will be here tomorrow.
[13:51] Alright.
[13:54] We will offer food there as well.
[13:59] I've arranged for it.
No...
[14:04] We will offer it there...
[14:07] but we have to give it at that place as well.
[14:12] What place?
[14:17] Where Adeel...
[14:20] used to distribute food.
[14:25] The place where...
[14:28] he went to give food after his reception.
[14:37] I tried stopping him...
[14:40] but he didn't listen.
[14:44] He never listened to me...
[14:50] But what he did was great.
[14:56] He had a soft heart.
[14:59] He took care of everyone.
[15:05] Anyways...
[15:08] I'll ask Mirha to bring food for you.
[15:13] Eat something.
Listen Ahmed...
[15:20] What?
[15:23] Forgive Mahi.
[15:30] For me, forgive her.
[15:32] She's our daughter.
[16:21] Why did this happen? This shouldn't have happened.
[16:26] Zara getting married to Saad! I wanted Saad...
[16:31] to be ousted from this house forever.
[16:34] But now, Zara will be marrying Saad.
[16:38] I will not let this marriage happen.
[16:41] I will not.
[16:44] I will have to stop this marriage.
[16:48] At any cost.
[17:01] I also have a condition.
[17:04] Condition?
[17:06] What condition?
[17:11] Zara will leave this house first, only then will Dolly return to this house.
[17:20] What kind of condition is this?
[17:24] Auntie...
[17:26] I don't trust your son at all.
[17:33] Sure..
[17:35] We accept your condition.
[18:23] You destroyed both of sisters' lives...
[18:28] Do you think I'll let your sister have a life?
[20:03] If my sister can be punished then why not your sister?
[20:08] That's what you said, right auntie?
[20:10] If your son can get away with destroying my sisters' lives, then we don't take long in breaking this relationship.
[21:14] Maheen... I'm going home.
[21:17] Why?
I need to do take care of things at home.
[21:22] What will I say to mother and father?
[21:25] They need me, you know what there position is.
[21:28] And if you leave then I will have to leave with you.
[21:33] So that's not a problem, I'll bring you back here tomorrow.
[21:35] I can't leave, you've seen how Zaini is...
[21:38] How can I leave my mother and father?
[21:40] You're not leaving anywhere.
What will I do staying here?
[21:43] I cannot stay... mother has called me a few times now...
[21:47] Then tell her that my father, Ali and everyone else needs you here.
[21:54] Can't you do this for us? You know how father got unwell yesterday.
[22:00] Call auntie, I'm sure she'll understand. If you can't, then let me talk to her.
[22:06] No I'll call her myself.
[22:10] Alright... if she asks to come, please refuse.
[22:29] Not only just your father, you embarrassed your entire family and proved...
[22:36] that your father failed in carving out a diamond.
[22:41] Who I thought was a diamond turned out to be an ordinary stone.
[22:56] My dear why are you putting yourself in pain for him. If he was never yours...
[23:02] then why are you crying for him?
[23:06] Mother he was mine. Why did he betray me?
[23:11] Why did he betray me?
[23:13] Why did Zara do this to me? Why did she steal my love for me?
[23:19] Why did she do this?
[23:22] Zaini... my dear...
[23:27] I will die without Saad mother.
[25:32] How's Zaini feeling now?
[25:35] She's crying alot. She's in pain.
[25:42] I couldn't find the courage to go in front of her.
[25:47] For a father, it's so hard to see tears in the eyes of his daughter.
[25:54] May God protect all parents from this pain.
[25:59] I'm an unlucky father...
[26:03] Sarwat, if someone in the market I could buy a good fate for my children...
[26:09] then I would have sold myself to buy them.
[26:12] You have to control yourself.
[26:15] Zaini needs us right now.
[26:17] Yes, I have to control myself for Zaini.
[26:21] I have...
She had such high fever.
[26:25] I just gave her medicine.
[26:27] What should I do? Should I take her to the doctor?
[26:30] No... the fever will come down. We can't do anything but wait.
[26:36] Tomorrow will be very hard for her... don't leave her alone for a single moment.
[26:46] How will tomorrow pass?
[26:50] I pray that it goes by without destruction.
[26:59] Check in on her please.
Sit down, I'll bring tea for you.
[27:03] Sit down for a few minutes.
[27:05] I'll bring you some medicine.
[27:46] Zaini...
[27:50] Zaini...
[27:56] Zaini, wake up.
[27:59] You have a fever Zaini.
[28:02] Get up and take your medicine. Your fever has increased.
[28:08] Get up.
[28:10] Zaini wake up.
[28:25] You'll have to take your medicine, otherwise how will you get better?
[29:01] Rest up... I have to take care of something with mother.
[30:14] Fareeda, I've been here for ages and you aren't speaking.
[30:21] I just don't feel well.
[30:26] I want to rest for a while.
[30:30] Go ahead, she's here.
Sure, sit with her.
[30:39] It's good you're here auntie.
It was hard for me to find the time.
[30:44] Sadaf told me that your mother wasn't feeling well.
[30:48] That's why I came here.
[30:49] After Adeel's death, mother has been very down.
[30:54] Yes dear, I can understand. It's hard to forget one's son,
[31:00] Of course.
[31:04] How's your sister-in-law?
Who... Zara?
[31:07] You had only one sister-in-law...
[31:11] I'm sure she's fine.
[31:13] You should check up on her. She was your relative.
[31:19] She was... but we've cut all ties with our aunt.
[31:23] Relationships aren't ended so easily, besides you have a blood relationship with her.
[31:28] What are you saying? Let's talk about something else.
Why?
[31:33] Find out what she's doing nowadays. Adeel's death anniversary is around the corner.
[31:38] Are they thinking about marrying her?
Marrying her?
[31:42] Oh yes... girls nowadays don's stay at home for long and your sister-in-law...
[31:50] I think that she has forgotten your brother, that's why she didn't ask about anyone.
[32:00] Please drink your tea.
[32:20] Uncle, you have it wrong.
[32:24] The time between right and wrong has passed.
[32:29] Now there will be punishment.
[32:31] Alongside you, everyone else will be punished.
[32:34] Then punish me however you want. Strangle me...
[32:40] Even if you sacrifice yourself you won't be able to redeem the honor of this house.
[32:57] Mother sent this, change it.
[33:03] Where is mother?Why?
[33:05] I want to talk to her.
[33:06] She doesn't want to talk to you. Wear this and come downstairs.
[33:10] I will not wear these clothes.
[33:11] Why are you creating a scene? Mother didn't choose to send you this...
[33:18] Think that this is your coffin which you have selected for yourself.
[33:24] If you guys hate me so much then what's the need for these theatrics?
[33:29] Send me away as is...
[33:30] We have to do this! Not all of us are like you.
[33:35] Someone who doesn't are about her father or sister!
[33:40] I'm keeping this here, be sure to wear it and come outside.
[34:07] Find out what's she doing nowadays.
[34:10] Adeel's death anniversary is around the corner...
[34:14] Girls nowadays don't stay at home and your sister-in-law...
[34:20] I think that she has forgotten your brother, that's why she didn't ask about anyone.
[34:31] Try and understand my compulsion, I have to prepare for everything right now.
[34:39] I cannot wait till tomorrow. Try and do it today, please!
[34:44] I'll be waiting for you.
[34:48] Father...
[34:54] Father please don't turn away from me...
[34:57] I cannot see myself falling from grace in front of you.
[35:01] I don't want to talk to you.
[35:03] Father why are you doing this? You have always believed me... then why...
[35:08] What else can a father who is compelled do?
[35:14] Zara the face we are born with...
[35:18] is not our choice...
[35:22] But surely we are responsible for the face we have when we die.
[35:30] And that face represents our character.
[35:37] You not only degraded your father, but also your family and proved...
[35:44] that your failed in carving out a diamond...
[35:49] What I thought was a diamond was an ordinary stone.
[35:55] Father...
[35:57] Don't do this father... I'll die! Don't do this to me!
[36:04] Your father died long before you did!
[36:11] This is your last day on in this house. Keep my respect.
[36:16] Father... please listen to me
[36:53] Mother... get up.
What's the matter with you?
[36:55] We have to go now.
Where?
[36:58] I'll tell you about it later, but get up for now!
[37:00] Who will tell your father?
[37:03] We'll say anything... but for now... get up.
[37:06] What's with you? Where are we going?
[37:10] Lord knows where you are taking me...
[37:12] You ask so many question... come with me.
