[00:13] I am not ready to change my decision about the plot I have given to Zara.
[00:20] Why are you mentioning that plot? I don't want that plot back.
[00:25] When I have given her my only son that there is no worth of that plot in front of him.
[00:31] Actually, I want to clear all grievances.
[00:36] I have made that mistake so I apologize in front of you for that.
[00:41] Mr. Manzoor.
[00:43] I made a very big mistake.
She was absolutely doing like this.
[00:49] Please forgive me.
[00:53] I will treat Zara as my daughter not as daughter-in-law.
[01:12] Aunt, do you need anything?
[01:19] Please sit otherwise you will get tired.
[01:23] Are you still angry with me?
[01:27] No aunt, I never got angry with you.
[01:31] Really?
[01:34] But Adeel told his dad that you refused to marry him because of my behavior.
[01:38] Actually....
No problem if you are not finding any excuse. No problem.
[01:47] I already forgot that thing.
[01:51] I realized that you must have said that out of anger but
[01:57] This is not a right thing to do.
[02:00] Because when we have to respond such thing.
[02:07] Till then the anger cools down.
[02:12] But that thing doesn't get finished.
[02:16] If you mind that then I apologize to you.
[02:21] Hey no, just leave it. There is no need to apologize.
[02:27] This is my nature. I say what is in my heart.
[02:32] Just like I said everything clearly in front of Saad.
[02:38] You must have felt bad about that.
[02:41] Because he is your best friend.
[02:46] No aunt, it's Saad's habit to tell jokes like this.
[02:50] I was stopping him and I forbade him as well.
It's OK.
[02:55] If his parents didn't teach him that how to treat elders then they must have faced it's consequences.
[03:02] I don't care.
[03:04] His dad must be getting punished in the life hereafter.
[03:08] I think his mother is also very ill.
[03:11] Yes, she is not feeling well.
[03:15] Oh and look at that joker.
[03:18] He roams around Zenny round the clock.
[03:24] But that's good specially for Zenny.
[03:28] If she will treat him as a slave then she won't face problems like Maheen.
[03:35] Otherwise people don't stop saying weird things.
[03:41] They will say that what's wrong with the girls of this house that they can't live happily in their house.
[03:48] Saad has been coming here since his childhood.
[03:52] At that time, no one even knew that he will be engaged with Zenny.
[03:55] Oh yes.
[03:58] Everyone was so surprised on this engagement.
[04:03] Even I also thought that he will be engaged with you.
[04:08] I am saying this because you have a very good friendship with him.
[04:14] Anyways, the boys like Saad are
[04:20] It's not good to make them friend nor enemy.
[04:25] I don't talk to even friends of such people's friends.
[04:32] Well, don't take it to yourself.
[04:38] I am not saying anything to you, my dear child.
[04:42] If I will have to say anything to you then I will say that very clearly.
[04:46] And I will also slap you on your both cheeks.
[04:51] This is my nature.
[04:54] By the way, we don't have that conventional mother-in-law and daughter-in-law's relation.
[05:00] You are my daughter and this is normal among mother and her daughter.
[05:06] And I also treat Mahi and Mirha in same way.
[05:11] Why am I telling you, you must have known about that.
[05:14] Adeel shares each and everything about our house with you.
[05:19] Am I right?
[05:24] Anyways, press my dress quickly.
[05:28] And after that make a cup of tea.
[05:31] Right?
[07:08] What happened to both of you?
Nothing.
[07:13] And where is Zara?
Zara is at service of her mother-in-law.
[07:19] Which service?
[07:21] Aunt has asked her to press her dress so she is doing that.
[07:28] Hmm.
And her mother-in-law has give her work immediately.
[07:36] By the way, what do you think about aunt Farida's drama?
[07:41] I don't know Saad and I don't want to know about it either.
[07:48] What happened to her?
[07:51] I don't know.
[07:52] Right now I am worried that what must be happening there.
[07:57] Nothing will happen. I am here.
[08:00] I will take care of everything.
[08:03] Really? But how.
[08:08] If I will have to bow down my head because of this friendship then I will do that.
[08:13] I will apologize to Zara's mother-in-law.
[08:16] Will you apologize? Huh, you can't face aunt.
[08:21] Now, you are teasing me.
[08:25] I will see you once this tension is finished.
[08:30] Yes I am also worried about that.
[08:33] Zara hasn't come back yet.
[08:38] Mahi, we should call police.
[08:40] I am going to neighbor's house and call dad.
No Mahi.
[08:44] Don't go by leaving me alone. Please.
[08:46] I am afraid that they will come again.
You opened the door, so why are you scared now?
[08:51] I didn't open the door for them Mahi.
Really?
[08:53] Then who came that you went out even in this condition?
Mahi.
[08:58] I don't know.
[09:01] Sit here quietly. I will be right back.
[09:23] Do you know, what was Maheen saying?
What was she saying?
[09:27] She said that sister Farida was just pretending to apologize and she has some other intentions.
[09:34] Make her understand that we don't have to take this matter long.
[09:39] I also said this to her but she was continuously repeating the same thing then I said that should we ask Zara to stay here like you.
[09:49] Then she got angry with me and said that she will never say anything about Zara's matter.
[09:54] That will be good if she won't say anything.
[09:58] Whatever she said was her childish behavior but whatever you said was not right at all.
[10:05] Is this the way to talk to our daughters? Why did you say that?
[10:10] As I told you that she was continuously talking so I just said that to keep her quiet at any cost.
[10:17] I told her that Adeel is a nice guy and he will handle everything. If husband is good then mother-in-law and sister-in-law can't do anything bad.
[10:25] He is ready to give her a separate house so he will make everything better.
[10:31] Usama contacted me as well.
[10:36] Usama called you?
[10:38] What did he say?
He wants to come here.
[10:44] He shouldn't come here in their presence.
[10:52] OK, I forbid him.
[10:56] If you will forbid him then he will think that you don't want to meet him.
[11:01] O God.
[11:04] Children are test for parents.
[11:13] What do you say?
[12:04] Where did you go?
Were you missing me?
[12:08] I wasn't missing you at all.
Really?
[12:12] Then I am leaving and I won't come back until you won't miss me.
[12:16] It's not good to go there where you are not missed.
[12:19] Let's go in like a good boy and that won't benefit you if you will do that because I won't miss you even then.
Really?
[12:27] So, it's my misconception. You don't love me at all. Right?
Adeel.
[12:33] Adeel.
[12:35] Where were you? I was looking for you for a long time.
[12:40] What have you brought?
[12:42] What have you brought for my daughter-in-law?
Actually.
[12:47] Sister-in-law called me and asked me to pick something from her mother's house so I have picked that.
Which sister-in-law?
[12:53] The wife of your newly married friend?
Yes.
[13:01] Oh my God.
[13:04] I am unable to understand the girls of this generation.
[13:08] He just got married and now she is missing her mother's house.
[13:12] If that was the case then she should have stay with her mother and wouldn't get married. No one forced her to get married. Right?
[13:18] OK, I will tell her when I will go back.
Why will you make her understand?
[13:23] You should talk to your friend. Tell him that if he will  control his wife right now
[13:30] Then he will be saved otherwise he will regret.
[13:34] OK, I will tell him.
[13:36] Tell me, did you talk to sister Maham?
[13:39] I called her but her phone was switched off.
Well.
[13:43] I was about to ask you but you are asking me. I thought that you must have talked to her.
[13:47] No, I even called Mirha but her phone was also switched off.
Oh God.
[13:52] Zara, you must have talke to her. When did you talk to Mahi last time?
[13:57] I didn't talk to Mahi.
[14:00] You didn't talk to her.
[14:02] But you must have called Mirha to ask about her well being.
[14:08] What did she say? Why are their phones switched off?
[14:11] I didn't talk to Mirha as well.
What?
[14:15] You didn't talk to Mirha. You didn't even call her.
[14:19] At least you should have called her to ask about her well being. My daughter got such a big accident but you didn't even call her.
[14:26] I called her that day and I have calling her since last two days but Mirha didn't receive my call.
[14:30] Well, she was not in her senses during last two days.
[14:34] You should have called her later and ask her about her health.
[14:38] What she must be thinking that her sister-in-law doesn't take care of her.
[14:41] At least you should have taken care of that.
But Mirha should have called her back if she couldn't receive her call.
[14:47] Anyways, just leave it. Let me try to contact them.
[14:50] Yes do something Adeel.
[14:53] My heart is pounding. Some weird thoughts are coming to my mind. My daughters are alone at home. What must have happened to them?
[14:59] Aunt, why are you getting worried. Nothing must have happened, everything must be alright.
And by the way, two girls are not alone at home
[15:07] Don't worry, let me call her.
Yes ask someone to give information about them.
[15:11] Hey, ask the same friend, for whom you are doing these services.
[15:15] Ask him to do this for you, he should go to our home and get information about my daughters.
[15:21] My heart is pounding. You don't understand that my daughters are alone at home.
[15:47] Hello.
Hello, greetings dad. Dad, where are you and where is mom?
[15:55] What happened my child, you look worried and whose number is this?
[16:03] Dad, I am calling you from Reshma's number. Just tell me, where are you?
[16:07] I am at home and I was sleeping.
[16:11] Tell me, why are you so worried?
[16:14] We are in big trouble. Our house has been robbed and they took everything.
[16:20] What do you mean?
[16:23] Are you and Mirha alright?
[16:27] Yes me and Mirha are alright but
[16:30] They took all cash, jewelry and our mobiles that's why I am calling you from her number.
[16:34] Dad, please come back quickly.
Don't worry about those things, those will be bought again.
[16:40] Thank God that both of you are safe.
[16:45] My child, don't worry.
[16:49] Please come back quickly dad.
OK, we are coming back immediately.
[16:55] Listen to me.
[16:58] Don't tell anyone about this incident.
[17:01] Especially to your mother.
[17:04] Otherwise she will keep crying on the way back.
No, I won't tell anyone dad.
[17:10] But please come back. I need you dad.
Yes, we are coming back.
[17:15] Go back to home and take care of yourself and Mirha. OK, good bye.
OK. Good bye.
[17:22] Thank you Reshma.
[17:23] Maham do one thing. Bring Mirha here until uncle and aunt are back.
No Reshma, I have to go back home.
[17:29] Mirha's foot is injured.
[17:31] She can't even walk. OK, I am leaving. She is alone at house.
Good bye.
[17:37] OK, ask them to talk to me as soon as you reach there. OK.
[17:42] What did he say? When will he reach there?
I asked him to go there and ask them to talk to me.
[17:47] Oh God, I don't know whose evil sight effected my house.
[17:51] Who is that cursed one?
[17:54] Nothing is right, first Mirha got that accident and now this. Oh God.
Mom, why are you getting worried? Nothing will happen.
[18:06] We will talk to them shortly.
How will that time pass Adeel.
[18:10] I am so worried. Ask him to go there quickly and ask them to talk to me.
[18:15] All these problems only come to me. Look at your dad.
[18:19] He is sleeping soundly. He doesn't have any worry that his two young daughters are alone at home.
[18:24] Mom, nothing will happen. Please be patient.
[18:27] Just think, that how can I get relax. Have their phones switched off like this earlier?
[18:34] The phones of both of them are switched off.
Why are you thinking negatively? Nothing will happen.
[18:40] Please pray to God.
[18:43] Just relax.
[18:46] Oh God, My Lord, keep my daughters safe.
Everything will be alright.
[19:04] Maheen.
[19:17] Maheen.
[20:22] Last time Adeel and Mahi came here then Mirha got accident.
[20:26] And now, our house is robbed.
[20:29] God forbid, I don't know whose evil sight is effecting my house?
[20:44] Tell me, didn't your mother-in-law say anything to you?
[20:51] I forbade you Saad.
[20:53] But you get out of control in your jolly mood. That's really rude.
[21:00] It means that she has said something.
She didn't say anything.
[21:04] But she has felt bad about that.
[21:09] And anyone can feel bad about that.
[21:13] You should be careful.
[21:15] All of us can understand your nature.
[21:19] I can understand that because I know you but not everyone will understand that.
[21:25] So please be careful.
You are hiding that from me.
[21:30] I am hiding nothing. I told you that she didn't say anything. Why are you repeating same question again and again?
[21:35] So why are you so angry? That was just a joke.
[21:39] And I think that you are minding more than aunt Farida.
[21:43] Saad don't talk to me in a loud voice. You know that I am right.
No, you are not right.
[21:49] This has been happened so many times that you are misbehaving with me because of them.
[21:54] I didn't say any such thing. I am just saying that
[21:59] If you don't tell me then won't I understand?
[22:02] Do you understand? What have you understood?
[22:06] Saad, you are son-in-law of this family so take care of your honor.
[22:12] And just go, I have to do my work. I don't have spare time to talk to you.
[22:17] And listen to me.
[22:19] I am son-in-law of this house.
[22:22] So treat me with respect.
[22:45] Hey, hey, stop. Where are you going in such a hurry?
[22:48] I am going back to home.
So soon?
[22:51] What do you mean by that?
[22:53] I am not that son-in-law who stays in in-laws' house.
No, I didn't mean that.
[22:59] Has anything happened?
Nothing has happened.
[23:02] Has someone said anything to you?
[23:05] Has aunt Farida said something?
There is no such thing. Why do you stick with everything?
[23:11] Saad, I will do that if you won't tell me.
[23:16] When I am saying that nothing has happened. Then?
[23:19] Oh I see, it means that Zara must have said something.
She didn't say anything.
[23:25] Give me the way.
OK, you can go but don't go with this bad mood.
[23:31] Dolly called me, mom's medicine have been finished so I have to bring her medicine.
[23:36] OK, but when will you come back.
I will come back, but let me go now.
[23:42] OK, ride your bike carefully. Please.
[24:00] Dad, you called me.
Yes, Adeel, we will have to go back immediately.
[24:06] We will have to go back immediately?
[24:09] Is everything alright?
No my son, nothing is right.
[24:13] But don't tell your mother.
[24:19] What's the matter dad, please tell me.
[24:21] Our house has been robbed.
[24:25] Our house has been robbed?
Yes.
[24:28] Keep your voice low.
[24:29] Your mother shouldn't know about it.
[24:33] Did you talk to Mirha and Mahi.
[24:35] I am trying to call them continuously but their phones are switched off.
What happened? What are you hiding from me?
[24:41] My house has been robbed and you are hiding this from me.
[24:45] Oh God, In which condition are my daughters? I want to talk to my daughters.
[24:53] My house has been robbed.
Farida, keep quiet.
[24:58] That's why I didn't want to tell you.
[25:01] I knew that you will react like this.
[25:05] Both Mahi and Mirha are safe.
[25:08] And such robberies are a common thing now.
[25:14] It's not a common thing for me.
[25:17] It's a very significant thing but why are you saying that this is normal.
[25:21] It's a very significant thing for me.
[25:23] I never lost anything in my house.
[25:27] And now my house has been robbed today and that too at which time
[25:32] Had this robbery to be happened today when we are here to fix Adeel's marriage date and you are saying that it's a normal thing.
[25:38] It's just a mere coincidence.
[25:41] Such people do research of houses and they must have known that both girls are alone at home.
[25:47] It's not a coincidence.
[25:51] It's a signal from nature. Why don't you understand?
[25:54] Nature is trying to tell us that this girl is not right for my house.
[25:59] She has a bad omen. She will bring destruction to our house. She is cursed.
[26:03] And now I won't take her to my house. I am telling you.
[26:08] Dad, make her understand, what is she talking about?
What am I talking about? Don't you see?
[26:14] I won't take her to my house. I can't see my house ruined.
[26:19] I will make decision. Refuse them.
Just keep quiet.
[26:24] I don't understand you. You change your thoughts within seconds, you become mad.
[26:30] Yes, I become mad. Yes, I am mad.
[26:33] But I am telling you clearly that I won't let my house destroy like this.
[26:39] Adeel, make the decision right now, right away.
[26:41] Divorce that cursed girl right now, right away. I am telling you that I won't take her to my house.
[26:55] My daughters are alone there. My house has been robbed but you don't care about that. You only care about that cursed girl.
[27:03] Divorce her.
[27:04] She has a bad omen. My house has been robbed because of her. Oh God.
Just shut up.
[27:23] I am going to talk to brother Manzoor and I warn you if you tried to follow me.
[27:28] And one more thing.
[27:29] Pack your things. I will be back.
[27:37] Mom, listen to me.
You listen to me.
[27:41] Do I also pack your things or will you sit here in front of them to explain everything?
[27:47] They will blame us that we have made an excuse.
[27:53] It's very easy for them to blame us.
[27:57] OK, I am going also going with you. Please lower your voice.
[28:03] As you know that Mirha is very sensitive.
[28:06] She is youngest among siblings.
[28:09] She was so scared.
[28:10] She was so scared that she tried to stand from wheel chair and run away, she forgot that her leg is broken.
[28:15] She wanted to safe her life.
[28:17] Thank God that you are safe.
[28:20] We can buy those things again.
[28:22] But nothing is more important than our life.
[28:25] You are absolutely right.
[28:27] Let me call Adeel, you should talk to him.
[28:29] He asked me to do that.
[28:33] Yes please.
[28:38] Someone is calling you.
[28:42] Hold on, it's Hamza's call. Maybe Mahi wants to talk to me.
[28:45] Let me talk to him. Hello, Hamza
[28:49] Hamza, how are you?
[28:53] Ask Mahi to talk to me.
[28:59] Hello.
Are you alright Mahi? Is Mirha alright?
[29:07] Didn't those goons misbehave with you? I am so worried.
[29:11] Yes mom, both of us are absolutely fine.
[29:13] When will you come back? Please come quickly, I am afraid.
[29:17] Did you see my child?
[29:19] You asked me to bring that cursed girl to our home.
[29:25] Did you see now?
[29:26] Our house has been robbed before her marriage.
[29:34] I have made my decision. I have told Adeel.
[29:38] I won't get convinced at any cost.
[29:40] I will ask Adeel to give her divorce right now, right away.
[29:46] Mahi, my heart is pounding. I don't understand anything.
Mom, hello, hello.
[29:52] Mom, I can't hear you. Let me go outside.
[29:57] Hello, mom.
[29:59] Hello. Can you hear me.
[30:03] Yes I can hear you and I was hearing you earlier as well.
[30:05] But Hamza was sitting there so I couldn't talk to you.
[30:09] OK. Mahi
[30:13] I have told Adeel clearly.
[30:15] I won't accept Zara at any cost now. That's it.
[30:20] What are you doing mom?
[30:21] I told you everything. Treat them with fake love.
[30:26] They shouldn't know about your feelings.
[30:29] I can't do that.
[30:31] I can't do such dramas.
[30:34] I have told Adeel clearly that I don't need this girl so I don't need this girl. That's it.
Don't you need your son as well?
[30:41] If you will reject Zara then you will also lose Adeel.
[30:46] Why don't you understand Mahi? Try to understand my point.
[30:51] She has a bad omen and because of her my house has been robbed today.
[30:57] She don't have a bad omen.
[30:59] All of this has been done by your own daughter. Mirha is behind this robbery.
[31:04] What?
[31:07] What are you talking about?
[31:09] Why would Mirha do that? Why are you blaming her?
You know it very well that I don't lie.
[31:14] I never lied, I am telling you the truth.
[31:16] Anyways, it's not important at the moment. We will talk about it when you will come back. Just fix marriage date and come back.
[31:23] Hey, go to hell that marriage. Tell me about Mirha.
[31:28] Why are you blaming her?
[31:31] Why do you repeat same thing again and again? As I said that we will talk about it when you will come back.
[31:36] Mom, you should assure them that Zara will live very happily after marriage in our house.
I won't do that at all.
[31:44] I can't do that.
[31:47] Why don't you understand?
[31:51] If you want to remove Zara's love from Adeel's heart then you will have to accept her first. And listen to me very carefully, I won't support you this time.
[32:01] I will support dad and Adeel.
Wow, that's wonderful.
[32:06] Now you will also go against your mother?
Yes.
[32:10] I will go against you but I won't oppose you.
[32:14] Both of us will have to do this hypocrisy to accept Zara.
[32:19] You will see that this hypocrisy will bring your son to your feet. Are you getting my point?
[32:25] OK, don't day anything.
[32:28] Tell me about Mirha's matter.
[32:31] What's that matter?
Hello. Hello. Mom.
[32:36] Mom, I can't hear you, I will talk to you later.
[32:39] Hello, I can hear you clearly.
You are hearing my voice. Right?
[32:44] So listen.
[32:47] Just do what I am saying. Pretend to be kind to them.
[32:51] And how to change this sweetness into bitterness, I will tell you about that.
[32:55] Are you getting my point?
[32:57] I am going. Good bye.
No Mahi.
[33:00] Mahi.
[33:04] She hanged up the phone.
[33:08] What's that Mirha's matter?
[33:12] How did you get this accident?
[33:15] I was hit by a bike rider and I fell down.
[33:20] Oh sorry, I didn't know about that.
[33:23] Can you please take me to doctor. I am feeling so much pain.
[33:27] Me?
I will get brother Adeel's permission.
[33:31] Please take me.
[33:32] OK don't worry. Let me try to bring doctor here.
[33:38] Thank you.
[33:54] Brother, here is your coffee.
[33:57] I don't want to take it.
[34:00] But you asked me to bring it.
So, I am refusing now.
[34:04] I will tell you when I will need it. Take it away.
[34:10] What's the matter? Is everything alright?
[34:15] No.
[34:18] Did Zara say anything?
No.
I am your sister.
[34:23] I can understand brother. Tell me what's the matter?
[34:29] That was my mistake.
[34:37] Brother, can I say something if you don't mind.
[34:43] Do you know, what is your mistake?
[34:46] That you go there so often.
[34:48] Brother that is your in-laws' house. You shouldn't go there that much.
[34:52] Yes, that's my in-laws' house.
[34:54] That is not any border that I will be caught if I cross the line of control.
[34:57] That's not a border but there is a line of control in relations. And that should be there.
[35:04] Brother you go there everyday and sometime you go there twice or thrice in a day.
[35:08] It's not good. Your respect may lessen if you go there often.
[35:13] This is old school of thought. Now no one believe this.
People do believe on this.
[35:19] And people who accept this they don't listen such things.
[35:24] So you are taunting me.
[35:27] Why would I taunt you brother?
[35:29] I am just telling you brother, that is not only your in-laws' house, that is also my in-laws' house.
[35:34] And I don't like at all when you come back in this bad mood.
[35:38] But I told you that it was my mistake.
But that doesn't make any difference that whose mistake was that or not.
[35:47] I am talking about your relation with that house.
[35:50] Try to understand this thing.
[35:51] Now just imagine that I will live in that house in future and if the same thing will happen in front of me then will I like that. Not at all.
[35:58] You don't know brother, it's a very big thing for a sister.
[36:09] OK, bring coffee again. It must be cold.
[36:15] Right.
[36:42] What are you talking about brother? Your house has been robbed.
[36:45] Oh my God, but how did that happen? Are our daughters safe?
[36:49] Yes, thankfully both daughters are safe.
[36:52] Such incidents happen these days.
[36:56] But you don't have to worry?
But why don't I worry?
[37:01] Our daughters were alone at house and house was robbed but you are saying that nothing to worry about.
Oh my God, I am saying the same thing.
[37:08] I am also saying the same thing that why should we worry. Make your brother understand.
[37:13] Last time Adeel and Mahi came here then Mirha got accident and this time our house has been robbed.
[37:23] God forbid, whose evil sight is effecting my house.
[37:30] Be thankful to God that our daughters are safe.
[37:34] And what about my desires with which I came here.
[37:37] I came here to fix my son's marriage but I couldn't put a red scarf on my daughter-in-law's head.
[37:45] It's a happy occasion but we won't be able to give sweets to each other.
[37:51] Oh God, it's such a bad start to this marriage, I don't know what will happen next.
[37:58] Sarwat listen to me.
[38:02] Recite Quran in house.
[38:06] Feed the starving and needy people.
[38:09] Give charity otherwise the jealous people will effect our children happiness.
[38:16] My God, keep my children happiness safe from evil sight.
[38:25] Stop sister.
[38:27] God accepts our wishes so don't say any bad thing, just mention good things.
[38:36] Hey, my child.
[38:38] My dear daughter. The light of my house.
[38:42] May you get my life.
[38:44] Don't tell your friends about Adeel.
[38:47] Girls do tell their friends about gifts from their fiance.
[38:55] But you don't know my child because you are so innocent.
[39:00] Girls become jealous.
[39:03] And my son gives you such expensive gifts then they must feel jealous about that.
[39:09] Aunt, what happened? Is everything alright?
[39:13] Nothing has happened. Just come here. Give me some cash.
[39:19] Give me some cash. Why are you delaying it.
[39:23] Let me give charity in my daughter's name.
[39:26] O God, keep my daughter's happiness safe from evil sight.
Take it Sarwat.
[39:33] Give it to any beggar. It's my daughter's charity.
[39:38] And you will see.
[39:41] Whoever has put an evil sight on my children happiness.
[39:44] He will get eye infection. You will see.
[39:50] What? No.
[39:53] No, I wasn't mentioning you. I swear I didn't say that for you.
[39:58] My heart is pounding.
[40:00] Bring water for me.
[40:03] My heart is pounding, I don't know about my daughter's condition.
Just sit down.
[40:10] Sit down. Bring water.
[40:14] I don't know whose evil sight effected my children happiness.
[40:20] My heart is pounding.
[40:22] Oh God.
[40:24] Oh God.
[40:25] Bring water.
[40:27] Bring it quickly.
