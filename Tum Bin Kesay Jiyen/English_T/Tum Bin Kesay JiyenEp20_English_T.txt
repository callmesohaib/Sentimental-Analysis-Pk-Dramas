[00:15] But remember one thing. 
[00:16] Hmm
[00:17] Strictly forbid Zara that don't discuss this matter with her family.
[00:21] We will inform them when marriage will be fixed.
[00:23]  You don't have to worry about it at all.
[00:31] Saad, don't be foolish. 
[00:33] Zenny has no objection on our friendship but you should think about your words.
[00:37] Other people don't give same importance to our friendship which we give. 
[00:42] They won't see us in that way.
[00:47] I want to say one more thing.
[00:49] Actually, Mahi wants that Zara shouldn't know about this proposal.
[00:57] But why?
[00:58] I don't know, Mahi wants it.
[01:02] There is no harm if we will hide this from Zara. 
[01:13] so brother, tell me is Zara happy in her in-laws house?
[01:17] yes, all thanks to God everyone is so happy. I am so grateful to God, I had a word with her yesterday
[01:22] Okay
[01:23] hey! so you should have made me speak to her as well. But you didn't tell me
[01:28] I will make you speak to her today
[01:32] please sit, meanwhile let me go & offer prayers
[01:39] by the way sister, there is one thing
[01:43] they should have sent Zara, as the bride & the groom visits the bride's house after marriage
[01:48] when will Zara come?
[01:50] No, actually both of them are going on a honeymoon
[01:54] so Zara said that she'll come back here directly from there
[01:58] may God always keep our daughter safe, and shall keep their love intact for each other
[02:03] may God save her from an evil eye of her friends too
[02:09] we had heard a phrase that "may God save from an evil eye of an enemy" but today you've brought something new
[02:13] a person shall not get affected by a friend's evil eye. Wow!
[02:16] since Zara doesn't have an enemy, that's why I didn't mentioned an enemy
[02:21] So, are you talking about brother? Because my brother is Zara's best friend
[02:26] No no, nowadays we easily get affected by the evil eye of a friend than an enemy. That's why I had said it
[02:33] rest, I didn't mean to point towards Saad. I've just said a general thing
[02:38] you are right
[02:40] how can you say this to me?
[02:42] because I am not habitual of keeping an eye on girls
[02:45] and that too bad one
[02:47] but shall I tell you something? I keep quite a strong eye on the people who keep bad eye on anyone
[02:55] are you getting my point?
[02:56] oh dear, what's wrong with you?
[02:59] you know its Adnan's nature to joke around. He isn't serious at all!
[03:03] so do you find me serious?
[03:05] oh...
we got scared
[03:07] I've seen someone joking around so seriously for the very first time
[03:11] he is such a good actor!
[03:29] oh God... look at the attitude of Sarwat's sharp knife
[03:35] she made a honeymoon's program so secretly
[03:38] and we got to know when they've received the tickets at home
[03:41] then stop them
[03:43] stop them, make some excuse
[03:46] hmm... I have to
[03:49] let me do one thing. 
[03:50] Let me say that we are fixing a proposal here, and my daughter-in-law's presence is so important
[03:54] mom, what happens to you? Why do you get so excited?
[03:57] you start talking like crazy people. 
Will you tell Zara that you are looking for my wedding proposal?
[04:01] oho... I have completely forgotten! It had slipped out of my mind all of a sudden
[04:07] I don't remember anything when something comes into my mind all of a sudden
[04:13] had I kept such torment in my house, if I knew how to do conspiracies in cleverly manner?
[04:18] I must say, let them go
[04:21] once she'll come back after enjoying with Adeel for a few days, only then she'll have a few good memories with Adeel in her old age after her divorce
[04:29] Okay, now don't talk too much
[04:32] I know you very well too
[04:35] you are provoking me deliberately, right?
[04:39] well.. no matter what happens. I won't let her go on a honeymoon
[04:44] what do you think? Will Adeel agree with you?
[04:48] no problem, if Adeel wants to go alone on the honeymoon then he can
[04:53] but I won't let Zara step outside the house, its my contumacy now!
[04:58] oh mom, there is a limit. Will Adeel will go alone on his honeymoon?
[05:02] what are you saying?
[05:04] do you know, go & sleep for sometime. Your mind is not working at all, go sleep for sometime
[05:10] Wow! who will feel sleepy?
[05:13] I won't be able to sleep tonight, what to do!
[05:17] I'm telling you, try to sleep for sometime
[05:20] maybe you get some dream or hint, and your son shall not go from here
[05:26] No... nothing can happen
[05:31] nobody agrees with me. 
Had anyone agreed last time?
[05:35] I did so much of drama, but still Adeel had gone
[05:40] this time this dream related thing won't work
[05:42] it doesn't matter if it didn't work once, try again
[05:46] maybe this time they agree
[05:48] what do they say?
"it is worth an attempt, whatever the outcome"
[05:53] at least try, besides nobody can harm you at all
[05:57] No
[06:00] it won't happen this time
[06:02] do you know, all of them think that my dreams are false
[06:07] what did you say? They think this way?
[06:13] mom, your dreams are false
[06:16] stop your rubbish, ok?
don't talk non-sense
[06:20] you'll see, there won't be any issue of false dreams anymore
[06:25] now I'll show you how to turn a dream into reality
[06:29] my name is Farida 
[06:33] be quiet, I am saying!
[06:36] oh God... 
[06:37] rubbish!
ill-mannered!
[07:40] everyone is feeling that something is wrong between us
[07:45] then let them feel
[07:47] as it is, everyone will get to know
[07:50] as if you'll be able to keep the matter to yourself
[07:53] I haven't told anything to anyone
[07:55] really?
[07:56] you must have told Zara, right?
[08:00] if you haven't told her now then you will tell her in a while
[08:02] and by tomorrow, I will get a call from her
[08:11] means, you didn't talked to Zara as of yet?
[08:13] oh!
[08:15] so it means you have already talked to her
[08:18] this is what I am saying
[08:20] when you have to tell everyone, then why are you telling me that everyone is feeling this because of me?
[08:30] Zaini...
[08:32] Zaini, listen to me!
[08:35] I shouldn't have called Zara
[08:50] Zara I was calling you, but you didn't pick up the call
[08:53] do call me back once you see my message
[08:56] and yes! if you talk to Zaini then don't tell her that we had discussed anything
[08:59] actually she has gone completely mad, I will tell you on the call
[09:02] yes but don't tell her anything that we had discussed any matter
[09:14] what happen Saad?
[09:17] who has gone mad?
[09:19] I've gone mad! And before its too late, I am going downstairs
[09:48] why aren't you facing me?
[09:52] I don't want to talk to you about anything right now
[09:54] and there are a lot of work at home
[09:56] mom has asked me to prepare tea
[09:58] you can make the tea later, but first listen to me
[10:03] see, there are guests in the home
[10:06] don't talk to me like this
[10:08] my family is not guest
[10:10] whatever
[10:13] I don't want to talk to you about anything right now
[10:16] Zaini, I am not liking this attitude of yours. Not at all!
[10:20] tell me if there is something
[10:23] Fine
[10:25] you'll come to drop me tomorrow, right?
[10:28] I'll talk to you then
[10:32] Zaini...
[10:35] listen
[10:38] you were right
[10:40] there is some problem going on between Saad & Zaini, because of Zara
[10:46] what are you saying?
[10:49] who said this to you?
Zaini?
[10:51] No! just now I was going to the terrace to get the clothes
[10:54] so Zaini was coming back from the terrace, she was so angry & furious
[11:00] I called her, but she ignored me deliberately
[11:02] and when I went upstairs, I saw Saad speaking to Zara on the call secretly
[11:07] he was saying, that nobody shall get to know about this matter
[11:14] by the way, what can be the issue? Do you know anything?
[11:20] what can be the issue?
[11:21] the same issue, that I had been mentioning since day one
[11:24] that Zara & Saad aren't friends at all, they are having an affair
[11:30] talk softly, have some God fear. What if anyone hears you!
[11:33] the dooms day will come now, this matter was a secret until Zaini wasn't aware of it
[11:37] but now everyone will get to know.
now someone has bowed down
[11:43] what will happen now!
[11:48] if you allow me, then can I talk to sister?
[11:52] there is no need to talk to sister, as if she'll agree to whatever you'll say. 
Absolutely not!
[11:58] you'll get affected by your own words
[12:01] you'll be proved a liar
[12:03] true that!
[12:05] but...
but?
[12:07] no ifs or buts, now we'll enjoy the game
[12:12] what was that innocent guy saying today?
[12:14] that I keep bad eye on girls & he keeps an eye on me, right?
[12:19] this is God's justice
[12:21] when this matter will be exposed, then I will see that guy
[12:27] how he will face the people
[12:30] by the way, for the first time you've brought a good news
[12:49] Dolly
yes brother?
[12:51] get me a cup of tea
[12:53] brother, I wanted to discuss something with you
[12:58] yes tell me
[13:00] are you & Zaini having any differences?
[13:03] No
[13:05] but it seems that you guys are having some issues, even mom was saying the same thing
[13:09] tell mom that there isn't any such thing
[13:12] I will tell her but she won't agree
[13:15] I cannot do any such thing about it
[13:17] and about what you had talked to Adnan?
[13:21] specially about Zara?
[13:24] brother, I haven't discussed it specially. The matter came up one after another, so I have said it
[13:31] so why you have said it? You shouldn't have
[13:34] don't you know that guy? He talks rubbish everywhere
[13:39] brother, this way he can also say that whatever you had said was not right
[13:43] why are you favoring him?
[13:46] whatever I had said, I would have said it for some reason
[13:49] I am not favoring him, I was just saying that whatever I had said about Zara was not bad
[13:56] but whatever you've said about brother Adnan that...
I've said completely right thing
[14:01] you know nothing about it
[14:05] and it would be better for you to stay away from this matter
[14:09] also keep yourself away from Adnan
[14:12] he is a disgusting man, a vile person!
[14:17] whatever I had said
[14:20] was absolutely correct!
[14:25] go, bring tea for me
[14:29] Ok
[14:41] uncle, is it important for me to get married? Don't you find me happy like this?
[14:47] dear, so have you planned to stay unmarried for lifetime?
[14:54] I don't want to get married right now
[14:56] then when you'll get married?
[14:59] if you like any girl then tell us
[15:03] we will take your wedding proposal there, & we won't have any objection
[15:07] No uncle, there isn't any such thing. I don't have any girl in my life
[15:12] Okay, then why are you refusing?
[15:16] do you think, will I be able to fulfill any relationship?
[15:19] yes yes, why not?
[15:22] I know, the life you've spent
[15:26] you have started to hate the relatives
[15:30] look at me
[15:32] dear, after your aunt's demise I was completely alone
[15:37] and then, I had the responsibility of the upbringing of all three of you
[15:41] the time helped me
[15:43] and I got remarried to Razia
[15:47] if I had been thinking like you at that time
[15:50] then how could I fulfill the responsibility of all three of you?
[15:53] what if they are also cheaters, then?
[15:55] no no, it won't happen
[15:58] they are my acquaintance, I know them very well
[16:03] they are not like that, they cannot be cheaters
[16:06] at least meet them once
[16:10] Ok uncle, if you think that family is good
[16:14] then I don't have an objection
[16:16] very good dear, very good!
[16:19] I was sure that you will never break my trust
[16:40] aunt, did you call me?
[16:43] yes? I had called you. I wanted to discuss something important with you
[16:48] yes
[16:49] all your traditional after marriage ceremonies have ended yesterday
[16:54] you know that, right?
[16:55] So, now bring back your life to the normal routine
[17:00] what?
[17:01] what do you mean by this?
[17:03] don't you know about normal routine?
[17:07] what do you mean by this, I didn't get it
[17:11] let me explain
[17:12] come with me, come... let me explain you right away
[17:19] Okay, so you love cooking right?
[17:23] alright then, today on wards its your responsibility to make all the three meals of the day
[17:29] ok fine
[17:31] by the way, which dishes you can cook?
[17:33] Umm... I can cook everything, Actually mom had taught us cooking after the completion of tenth grade
[17:39] we sisters can make all kind of food
[17:42] Ok ok, its such a good thing though
[17:45] my mother used to say that a girl's skill set can be observed from her kitchen
[17:54] if a woman is skillful then her kitchen will be always shining clean
[18:00] and if she will be unskillful then her kitchen's sink will always be flooded with dirty dishes
[18:06] don't worry, I will wash all these dishes right away
[18:09] since you have given me kitchen's responsibility, so now you'll always gets shining clean kitchen
[18:15] what do you mean?
[18:17] what are you trying to say?
[18:18] do you mean to say that I am unskillful & clumsy?
[18:23] No aunt, I didn't mean that. And how can I dare to speak such words for you?
[18:30] by the way, its not right to say used dishes as dirty ones
[18:36] what do you mean by this?
[18:38] mom says, the dishes in which we eat food. We shouldn't say them dirty
[18:42] Ok enough! whatever your mother had to say she has said it
[18:46] and you've heard it. Now forget it
[18:48] now remember what I am saying & act accordingly
[18:53] today on wars, this entire kitchen is your responsibility
[18:57] I shall see the kitchen shining clean 24/7
[19:02] you have to make all the three meals too
[19:04] I have done too much of work of this house, I've served everyone enough
[19:09] got my point?
[19:11] I am going
[19:13] I will come back after an hour
[19:15] I will check each & everything, everything shall be shiny
[19:20] why one hour aunt? I will clean everything within half an hour
[19:23] you don't have to get rid of it, you have to work hard
[19:29] got it?
[19:30] and yes! I am also having severe headache
[19:34] first make tea & serve me
[19:55] I couldn't even think
[19:57] that you can think about such things about me & Zara
[20:00] you know everything
[20:02] do you remember, when Ali & Dolly's proposal was getting fixed
[20:06] so our proposal was also fixed by Zara
[20:10] if there had been something as such between us, then why she would have done all this?
[20:15] yes, when did I said that I am doubting you both?
[20:19] even I haven't said anything about doubt
[20:22] Saad, why don't you say it clearly?
[20:25] if you aren't talking about doubt, then why are you giving so many clarifications?
[20:29] I have just said to you that you are ignoring me in front of her
[20:33] if you had felt that way, then you should have said at that time
[20:37] why are you saying it now?
[20:40] I didn't felt it at that time
[20:42] now I am feeling it that's why I have said it
[20:45] and... do you even remember your words what you had said to me?
[20:51] yes, whatever I had said I shouldn't have said it
[20:54] but I hadn't lied to you as well, Zaini
[20:57] I had said whatever I had felt, and the reason behind it was just friendship
[21:01] how does it feel when a friend goes away
[21:05] Zara was going far away
[21:08] and I didn't like her departure
[21:13] what's this, Saad?
[21:15] her departure was decided, right?
[21:18] one day or the other she had to leave with brother Adeel
[21:22] and... everyone stays mentally prepared for the girls
[21:27] because she never stays for lifetime
[21:29] there is no girl or boy in friendship
[21:32] a friend is a friend
[21:34] and she wasn't a girl for me but my friend, that's it!
[21:41] you have said the right thing.
[21:45] you have never considered me a girl as well
[21:52] Did you elder sister went on the honeymoon?
[21:55] or did your mother go?
[21:57] or your uncle took me to the honeymoon?
[22:00] nobody had gone, right?
[22:02] nobody had gone from our entire family
then you guys will also not go
[22:07] I am telling you very clearly
[22:10] remove these honeymoon thoughts from your mind
[22:51] Mahi, I was saying that tomorrow brother Noor Alam is coming
[22:54] as its Saturday tomorrow
yes
[22:56] I was thinking, what if he asks that why Mahi got divorced
[23:03] then what answer we'll give him?
[23:04] means, you'll tell him about my divorce?
[23:07] hey, obviously they'll ask. We cannot hide such matters
[23:11] people hide way too many things if needed, mom
[23:13] won't you be able to hide a divorce?
[23:16] hats off to you!
[23:20] I think, you won't be able to do this work & I won't get myself insulted
[23:24] leave it
[23:25] oh God Mahi, what shall I do with you?
[23:32] what happens to you!
[23:34] why do you become stubborn for no reason?
[23:36] you start talking rubbish, and now you've put up a new condition
[23:41] listen to me, think with a calm mind..
my thinking is not so useless, mom
[23:47] if you can't do whatever I have asked you to do, then refuse them for coming here
[23:54] what do you do!
[23:58] what's this?
[24:00] you've asked a newly wedded bride to start working? 
At least, let her come back from her honeymoon first
[24:05] what! honeymoon?
[24:08] which honeymoon? Honeymoon for what?
[24:12] who had gone for the honeymoon from our family?
[24:15] did you go? Or her elder sister had gone on the honeymoon?
[24:18] ask her
[24:20] tell me Zara, did you elder sister went on the honeymoon?
[24:24] or did your mother go?
[24:26] or your uncle took me to the honeymoon?
[24:29] nobody had gone, right?
nobody had gone from our entire family
[24:33] then you guys will also not go
[24:36] I am telling you very clearly
[24:39] remove these honeymoon thoughts from your mind
[24:44] go, wash the dishes & start preparing for the dinner
[24:47] Ok?
[24:54] now go
[25:01] honeymoon...
[25:03] enough! you are always after her
[25:06] what's wrong?
[25:10] she'll go on a honeymoon
[25:16] don't know how she has prepared the tea, its look quite bad
[25:32] remove these honeymoon thoughts from your mind
[25:36] go, wash the dishes & start preparing for the dinner
[25:40] Ok?
[25:51] greetings mom!
[25:53] how are you?
[25:55] greetings! my dear... stay blessed
[25:59] what's the matter? Are you having cold, because your voice sounds a bit heavy to me
[26:04] No mom, there isn't any such thing
[26:07] you tell me, how are you & how is dad?
[26:10] everyone is absolutely fine
[26:13] you tell me, is everything fine at home?
 I hope there is nothing to worry about
[26:18] actually I was missing you all, as I haven't met you guys since so long
[26:24] then ask Adeel to bring you here
[26:28] I am telling you, he will never refuse you
[26:31] do you know, even sister Asifa & Shaista were saying the same thing yesterday
[26:35] that you didn't even come back once ever since you got married
[26:39] mom, Adeel was telling me that he'll take me but I had asked him not to
[26:44] you say that daughters look good at their in-laws house
[26:48] I wish that Maheen shall also understand this
[26:51] that girl has made me worried sick
[26:55] sometimes I get worried for her, and sometimes your things makes me worried
[26:58] what shall I do?
[27:00] mom, please give some time to Maheen
[27:03] the time is slipping from our hands, dear
[27:05] she has been sitting in our house since so many days that...
[27:09] now the people have stopped asking us, they think that maybe she is here for forever
[27:13] Mom, please don't worry
[27:17] if you say so, then shall I talk to Maheen?
[27:19] No no, your father was saying that first I shall talk to her politely. So let me talk first
[27:25] ok?
[27:27] promise me that you won't get worried
[27:30] otherwise, I won't go anywhere & will come to your house
[27:33] oh no, no... go happily my dear as you are going abroad for the very first time
[27:39] enjoy a lot, ok?
[27:41] keep your warm clothes, as the weather might be cold over there
[27:44] and be little careful about your diet, dear
[27:46] because if your stomach will get upset then it will ruin the entire journey
[27:51] I will do whatever you have asked me to do, mom
[27:54] stay blessed my dear, & convey my love to Adeel. By the way, when is your flight?
[27:59] the flight is of day after tomorrow
[28:02] ok, do keep me posted
[28:03] both of you shall keep informing me. When you'll go to the airport, do let me know about the take off too. Ok?
[28:09] I will, mom
[28:11] can I talk to you later? As I have to do the packing as well
[28:14] okay my dear, in God's protection
[28:17] Bye!
bye!
[28:23] my dear child
[28:51] what do you mean by this?
[28:56] leave it
[28:58] you won't understand
[29:08] why shall I leave it?
[29:10] if I won't understand, then explain me
[29:13] but Zaini, stop it now
[29:16] its been so many days, now end your anger
[29:20] Zara is your friend
[29:23] so who am I to you?
[29:25] what kind of a question is this?
This question is wrong
[29:33] no question is wrong
[29:36] the answer is right or wrong
[29:39] and you have to give me the right answer
[29:43] you know its answer, Zaini
[29:47] but I want to hear it from your mouth
[29:52] who am I to you?
[29:54] I love you, Zaini

[30:00] do you really love me?
[30:05] I mean...

[30:15] I am not joking! 
Right now we are talking about love
[30:20] please!
[30:22] don't make fun of love
[30:24] how can anyone measure love?
[30:27] nobody can answer this question
[30:30] whom do you love the most?
[30:33] with Zara or me?
[30:36] Zara has her own place
[30:38] she is my friend
[30:40] how can I keep you & Zara on the same place?
Haven't you gone mad?
[30:45] and who is feeding such things in your mind?
[30:48] nobody is feeding me such things
[30:51] such things are coming in my mind automatically
[30:53] Saad, I never used to think about such things when she used to be here
[30:58] Since she has gone from here, I feel as if...
[31:01] she took away you as well with her
[31:05] you've changed, Saad
[31:09] you've changed
[31:26] there isn't any such thing
[31:29] I haven't gone
[31:32] I am here with you
[31:36] I love you, Zaini
[31:39] only you!
[31:41] then why don't you express it?
[31:44] why don't you say it, that you love me?
[31:49] Saad, I like to hear it
[31:52] say it to me that "Zaini, I love you"
[31:56] I like you.. I am only yours
[32:00] why don't you say it?
[32:02] I am only yours, Zaini
[32:04] only yours
[32:06] and I only love you
[32:10] and I will always keep loving you
[32:28] if aunt won't agree
[32:31] then won't we go?
[32:36] who said this to you?
[32:39] nobody...
[32:41] I am just asking you
[32:45] Adeel... we'll go, right?
[32:50] obviously we'll go
[32:53] mom also doesn't wanted us to get married, but what happened?
[32:57] we got married, right?
[33:00] when she couldn't stop me for marrying you, then will she be able to stop us for going on a honeymoon?
[33:05] its just...
[33:07] I am a bit scared
[33:10] about what?
[33:12] what if..
[33:15] someone separates us from each other
[33:26] Adeel
[33:28] what's there to laugh about?
[33:31] I am not laughing upon your words
[33:34] but on your expressions
[33:37] why do you feel so scared?
[33:40] see...
[33:42] I know Mahi & mom doesn't treat you well
[33:47] but it doesn't mean that they'll separate us, right?
[33:50] this is not the matter
[33:52] this is the matter
[33:54] I know you very well, at least don't hide it from me
[34:03] do you remember?
[34:05] I had said to you
[34:09] that no force in this world can separate us except for death
[34:13] Adeel!
[34:15] don't you feel ashamed while saying such things?
[34:18] why do you say such things?
[34:21] because if I won't say such things, then you don't get quiet. That's why I have to say such things
[34:26] such a bad thing
[34:27] what do you get by saying such things?
[34:31] Adeel, if you ever say any such thing ever then I won't speak to you
[34:36] at least listen to me
[34:37] I don't want to listen to anything, I am going to make dinner
[34:40] Zara... Zara!
[35:56] what are you doing, Saad?
[35:59] I was sleeping
[36:01] I love you!
[36:04] this is misbehavior, Saad
[36:06] I love you...
[36:12] are you taking revenge from me?
[36:15] I am not taking revenge, I am just telling you that...
[36:18] I love you!
[36:21] Saad, you know that I have to go to the university in the morning, right?
and you are annoying me
[36:27] then go, when did I stop you?
[36:29] yes so? I got disturbed from your messages, else I was sleeping
[36:35] okay, so you were sleeping?
as if your discussion hadn't disturbed me, right?
[36:41] ok so...
[36:43] you are taking revenge from me
[36:45] Okay, I am taking revenge
[36:47] you have said it yourself, that do express your love for me
[36:51] oh really?
[36:54] if you want to express it in this way, then please don't
[36:58] why so? I will do like this
[37:01] they say, "my love, my choice"
[37:04] oh... is it so?
[37:08] alright then

[38:08] Greetings sister!
[38:10] did you wake up early?
[38:12] No, how come I would have woke up early?

[38:39] why Saad won't come?
[38:43] why Shaista, why are you saying this?
[38:47] sister, I was saying this because Saad used to come for Zara. 
Now since she is not here, so he won't come
[38:54] hey!

[39:15] no mom, I am not hungry right now. I will have something in the university
[39:21] mom, Saad is here. I'm getting late, so I am leaving
[39:24] ok, be careful
[39:26] bye!
[39:30] She had said it just like that, you know Zaini is not of this nature
[39:37] don't take it to your heart, I will ask her to apologize to you
[39:41] oh sister, what are you saying?
[39:44] there isn't any such thing
[39:47] I know these girls when they were way too small
[39:51] why are you getting worried?
[39:55] anyways, come... let me prepare breakfast for you
[39:59] tell me, is Zara coming tomorrow? Will she leave for the airport from here?
[40:04] No, she didn't mentioned any such thing
[40:08] Okay
[40:10] Saad must be going to the airport to see her off, right?
[40:14] No, even if they'll go from here. Then Adeel's friend will drop them off
[40:25] shall I make tea for you?
[40:27] No, your tea is getting cold. Please drink it
