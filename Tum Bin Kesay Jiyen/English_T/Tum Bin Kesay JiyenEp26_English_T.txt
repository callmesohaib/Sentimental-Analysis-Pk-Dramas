[00:17] What I want to say is that I want you to forget about the past.
[00:24] You should not have any complaints against us, nor should we have any complaints against you.
[00:29] And even if we do, we shouldn't mention it to each other.
[00:34] Do whatever you want.
[00:36] But don't expect anything from me.
[00:40] Extend your hand in friendship, but don't ask me to do the same thing.
[00:44] If you want to remove her from this house...
[00:49] then you must grab her first.
[00:51] She wants to control him and through him rule over this house and us.
[01:00] Learn something from her.
[01:02] What better way could there be to rule over one's husband's heart?
[01:08] What could be a better way for her to love her family? What's so wrong with it?
[01:27] Adnan?
[01:30] Are you not coming downstairs for lunch? Brother Manzoor is asking about you.
[01:34] I'm watching my favorite drama.
[01:37] Tell him that I've fallen asleep.
[01:42] Everyone is waiting for you downstairs and you're watching your drama.
[01:48] There's a drama going downstairs.
[01:50] What do you mean?
[01:51] You really are naive.
[01:54] Shortly there will be a battle between a daughter and daughter-in-law.
[01:59] It's nothing like that.
[02:01] Everything is normal.
Oh really, tell me something...
[02:07] Why is Dolly staying here?
Such is the situation.
[02:12] It's expected of her to stay.
[02:14] No it isn't. She's staying here to provoke Maheen.
[02:18] What's the matter with you Adnan? She's Ali's elder sister.
[02:24] Why would she do that to her?
[02:25] She's Ali's elder sister, that's why she's tolerating her.
[02:29] Just wait and watch what Dolly says.
[02:33] Look how innocently how she found a reason to stay.
[02:37] It seems these dramas have started to have an affect on your mind.
[02:41] Don't make stories in your head.
[02:44] Be mindful. I know that family and I know those girls for so many years.
[02:49] It's nothing like that.
[02:51] Oh really! You think that Dolly is naive and doesn't know how the world work?
[02:59] Do you think that? You'll see how Dolly will control everything.
[03:05] She's a sweet knife. Be mindful of her.
[03:12] This house might appear to be brother Manzoor's, but in reality it belongs to his son.
[03:18] So it would be best for you if you are friends with Dolly.
[03:23] I'll get going.
[03:26] Where are you going?
[03:27] You just told me that brother Manzoor invited me, where else would I be going then?
[03:31] I can never read you. You're always so unpredictable.
You're right.
[03:40] Dolly had decided to stay here!
[03:43] Could someone please ask her the reason for her staying?
[03:46] I admit that our parents are worried, but will her staying fix everything?
[03:52] I'm telling you right now, she's only here to impress Ali.
[03:58] I know very well how much she cares about this family and the people living inside it.
[04:04] And Zaini, I'm surprised at you.
[04:07] Don't you understand how you'll be treated over there?
[04:11] What would happen to me? What would Dolly staying here do to me?
[04:19] Do you really not understand?
[04:21] Yes, I do no understand what you're trying to say.
[04:27] How can I forget that people in this house understand things when it's already harmed them.
[04:33] Then everyone regrets it. That is what bothers me.
[04:39] What are you trying to say? What's the problem if she's staying here?
[04:47] If she's staying here, then I'm sure people will praise her when they visit us.
[04:54] Let me tell you, everyone will compare her to you.
[04:59] Why would everyone compare her to me?
[05:03] You're marrying her brother and she is marrying yours. So a comparison is expected.
[05:07] And tell me one thing, when auntie Asfa had her operation how many days did you stay there?
[05:15] Zara went there, should we all have gone there?
[05:19] Zara did, not you. You are the one who will be married into that house, not Zara.
[05:24] I said this then, if you had listened to me then this wouldn't have been happening right now.
[05:30] It's very clear, ask Saad to come here and take Dolly away from here. Do you understand?
[05:47] Sister, you're making lunch?
[05:52] What's so surprising about it?
[05:55] I'm not surprised.
[05:58] I was just asking. Can I help you do some work?
[06:03] No... lunch is almost ready. Mahi offered her help as well. Not long until it's finished.
[06:12] Thank you.
[06:14] I was asking because I care about you.
[06:18] What are you making?
[06:20] Rice and lentils. It's all that I could make considering the time.
[06:25] Do you know we had stopped asking brother Adeel about what to make for lunch.
[06:30] Whenever we asked him he used to say one thing, rice with lentils.
[06:34] I'm sure you know that about him.
[06:43] Sister... I hope you didn't mind.
[06:50] I'll make the salad. Alright?
[07:24] Sister.
[07:29] Mother... mother!
[07:34] Mother...
What's the matter? Why are you calling me?
[07:38] Sister Zara is not well.
[07:40] Please check up on her.
What's so worrying about that?
[07:44] Ask your father to take her to the doctor.
[07:46] Mother you don't understand. This is not something that father can do.
[07:51] Go and check. Take her to the hospital.
[07:54] What do you mean to say?
[07:56] Mother, I think that sister Zara is about to become a mother.
[08:15] I hope what you're saying is true.
[08:19] Check where Mahi is, call her.
[08:28] Thank you so much God.
[08:36] I could never have imagined this.
[08:49] Tell him right now.
[08:52] Sister, you're asking me to tell Saad to take Dolly away from here.
[08:58] How can I say this to him?
[09:01] Why can't you?
[09:04] Will he not like it? Will he refuse to listen to you?
[09:10] He will only refuse when I ask him something like this. I will do no such thing.
[09:16] Sure why would you?
[09:18] Since I'm asking you to do this, I'm sure you won't ask him to take her away.
[09:22] Alright fine, do whatever you want. I'm insane for thinking in everyone's best interest.
[09:27] I was saying this for your well being.
[09:30] You're not married yet and it would be better if you are able to control Saad.
[09:35] Do what you want as Zara did, good for you.
[09:39] If you ever have to cry, be sure to close your door before you do.
[09:44] I don't want to hear you crying.
Don't worry.
[09:49] You won't hear my cries and God willing I won't be crying in my room.
[09:55] You'll see.
[09:56] Alright. That's very good. I hope your trust remains.
[10:02] There could be nothing better than that, even though I don't see that happening.
[10:10] There are things that can be better.
[10:13] You should at least keep things positive between us.
[10:35] Mother... what am I hearing? What was Mirha saying?
[10:40] Yes she told me... pray that what she's saying is the truth.
[10:45] Mirha is a child... use your brain.
[10:49] Vomiting doesn't necessarily mean that. Maybe she has a stomach bug.
[10:56] What are you saying! I'm sure that this is good news.
[11:02] I will be getting my Adeel back.
[11:04] Alright mother, but first have her checked.
[11:11] That's what I'm saying. Let's take her to the doctor and have her checked up.
[11:17] Sure we'll go, so that you are satisfied.
[11:22] But let me tell you, my heart tells me that this is good news.
[11:27] God isn't unjust. He took Adeel from me...
[11:33] and now He'll return him to me. I'll name him Adeel.
[11:37] I'll ask Zara to get ready.
[12:05] Zara... what are you doing in this heat?
[12:08] Go inside the room, turn on the AC and lie down.
[12:11] Why?
What do you mean? You'll grow unwell.
[12:16] Give this to me. I'll cook lunch today. Go and rest.
[12:21] I'm fine, nothing has happened to me.
[12:24] You're right. You have to tell everyone that you're fine.
[12:28] We don't know what's inside people's hearts.
[12:32] When the time comes everyone will know.
[12:36] I don't know what you're talking about...
[12:41] All of us are expecting a little Adeel, do you understand what I'm saying now?
[12:47] Mother is ready and you should too.
[12:50] Mother mentioned to me that you were pregnant.
[12:55] Get out of the heat and change.
[13:16] Do whatever you want. I'm insane for thinking about everyone's best interest.
[13:21] I was saying this for you well being.
[13:24] You're not married and it would be wise you have better control of Saad.
[13:29] Do whatever you want like Zara did. Good for you.
[13:36] I told you before and I'm telling you again.
[13:38] If you want to cry, close your doors because I don't want to hear it.
[14:33] We are expecting a little Adeel, do you understand what I'm saying now?
[15:04] Zara why are you still not ready? Get ready, mother is waiting for you.
[15:12] I don't want to go.
You're crying?
[15:17] Zara, pray for everything to be good.
[15:22] I don't think it's what you guys think it is.
[15:26] We can only know that when we go to the doctor.
[15:33] Besides you are not well, we have to go to the doctor.
[15:37] You have five minutes. Auntie Bushra is here as well, she'll come with us.
[15:43] Hurry up.
[16:50] What happened? Are you upset?
[16:55] No, I'm not upset.
[17:00] Alright fine... you were sitting here alone, I thought you were upset.
[17:09] Will you not ask me what I'm hiding from you?
[17:15] Will you no ask me why I'm lying to you?
[17:21] You're lying to me.
[17:26] No.
[17:31] What's the matter Zaini?
[17:33] Are you hiding something from me?
[17:38] It's nothing... you need not worry. I'm perfectly fine.
[17:46] You must be tired, rest up... sleep for a while.
[17:53] Hmm.
[17:56] That's good advice. I'm going to sleep.
Zaini...
[18:02] Why are you behaving so strangely with me?
[18:05] Do you mind me saying something?
[18:15] Happy engagement anniversary.
[18:21] I'm so sorry I completely forgot.
[18:26] Zaini I'm sorry, I forgot.
[18:32] I'm sorry.
[18:35] Zaini...
[18:53] What better could there be to rule over your husband's heart?
[18:58] What better way there could be to love his home and family.
[19:01] Only love should govern a household.
[19:08] What's the matter? Why are you smiling alone?
[19:13] It's nothing mother, can't I smile?
[19:17] Why not? I want you to always smile.
[19:24] What were you looking at? Whose photographs are these?
[19:28] They are photographs from brother's and Zaini's engagement.
[19:36] Mother do you remember when you guys were talking about Ali and I getting married,
[19:40] Zara talked about my brother and Zaini getting married.
[19:45] Sister Maheen wasn't happy then as well.
[19:48] Yes... I remember everything. Zara created such a scene.
[19:55] She was so happy after the engagement.
[20:01] Time passes by so quickly.
[20:05] Since we're here, let me order a cake.
[20:10] We'll do a minor celebration, it will improve everyone's mood.
[20:13] Dolly, that would be a foolish thing to do.
[20:17] You know what happened here, still you're saying such things.
[20:23] I don't know why you said that. Sorry mother...
[20:28] I just said it. Don't say anything like that again.
[20:33] Alright? It doesn't seem nice.
[20:36] If you want to do anything ask Saad to take Zaini somewhere out for dinner.
[20:41] When he picks her up from university.
I'm sure he'll take her without me saying anything.
[20:45] He takes care of everyone here.
[20:49] Besides, everyone loves him. Like their son.
[20:54] Why wouldn't they, my brother takes care of everyone.
[20:59] Shall I say something mother?
[21:03] I've been noticing that Zaini has been different lately.
[21:09] Brother limits himself away from her as well.
[21:11] I was wondering if something happened at Zara's home.
[21:15] Did auntie Fareeda say something to brother?
[21:19] Don't think of such negative things.
[21:24] If it were like that, we would have known.
[21:29] Besides, he loves you so much, still you don't stop complaining.
[21:35] Leave it mother.
You know we are guests here.
[21:40] And you have just been engaged.
[21:43] I know mother, but that doesn't mean that you stop me.
[21:49] You always scold me. No one asks sister Maheen why she behaves this way with me.
[21:56] You scold me all the time. No one cares, even you.
What?
[22:00] I don't care about you? I only care about you.
[22:04] If you do, then let me do what I want to do.
[22:07] Why do you always stop me?
[22:10] What's the matter with you?
[22:13] Dolly... this girl...
[22:28] Congratulations, you are about to become a grandmother.
[22:31] Really... thank God!
[22:37] Do you see... God listened to me.
[22:44] God has listened to me.
[22:51] You still talk to him Mirha? Don't you suspect Aqib at all?
[22:56] No... love and suspicion can never exist in the same plain.
[23:03] You're being metaphorical again, I would ask you to be practical again.
[23:08] I understand that you didn't know anything about Aqib when things began with him...
[23:13] But you do know now, be honest to yourself and tell me if you two have any match.
[23:20] You're saying this because he's poor, right?
[23:25] Sadaf, that is a very disgusting mindset.
[23:27] I didn't expect this from you.
[23:29] I didn't expect this from you. Do you think I'm talking about him being poor?
[23:35] Whatever you think is wrong.
[23:37] I've told you so many times to not speak in my matters, then why are you?
[23:42] You'll regret it Mirha. End your friendship with Aqib, he's not a nice man.
[23:48] Let me tell you something.
[23:50] Aqib says the same thing about you, should I end my friendship with you?
[23:55] You're thinking of ending our friendship because of Aqib?
[23:59] I'm not saying that Sadaf...
[24:01] I'm trying to make you understand that both of you have your place.
[24:06]  You two shouldn't have a problem with each other.
[24:13] You two compare yourself with each other all the time.
[24:18] Congratulations you are about to become a grandmother.
[24:21] Really... thank God.
[24:27] Do you see... God has listened to me.
[24:33] God has listened to me... didn't I tell you...
[24:38] You have to take good care of yourself. Take these medicine regularly.
[24:45] Don't worry doctor... I'll take care of her.
[25:38] Can I come in?
[25:45] I came to sleep.
[25:48] But I knew that it was just an excuse.
[25:54] What's the matter Zaini? Are you upset?
[25:58] What difference does it make?
It does make a difference.
[26:02] Should we go out somewhere?
[26:05] Why?
Why?
[26:08] I have a friend that used to say that if one celebrates the little things...
[26:15] then they become grand.
I know.
[26:20] That same friend always reminded you that I was part of your life.
[26:28] Whatever you've done up till now is because of that friend.
[26:33] Because of that friend you engaged me.
[26:38] What do you mean to say?
[26:44] You know I forgot. I forgot.
[26:48] Yes.
[26:50] You do forget, only things concerned with me.
[26:56] You forget everything related to me.
[27:04] If Zara was present in our lives... would you have engaged me?
[27:15] Zaini I'm apologizing to you.
You wouldn't have.
[27:19] If she hadn't asked you, you wouldn't even have looked at me.
[27:27] The way she didn't remind you today.
[27:34] A year ago...
[27:38] we were engaged on her say so.
[27:42] It's nothing like that, for no reason...
[27:44] Nothing happens for no reason. There is a reason behind everything.
[27:50] The reason you're upset...
[27:53] is not right. 
[27:56] You know the situation everyone is in, so what if I forgot?
[28:02] Yes... you forget.
[28:06] But it's always been like this, it isn't the first time.
[28:12] You have to be reminded.
[28:15] You just said that you needed to be reminded.
[28:22] When your father died, it was Zara's birthday ten or twelve days after that.
[28:30] You brought a cake for her, you brought gifts for her.
[28:36] Even if it was small, you celebrated her birthday.
[28:44] Are you comparing yourself to Zara?
No...
[28:52] I'm telling you that what you're portraying yourself to be...
[28:58] you aren't like that.
[29:02] If you know how I am, 
[29:05] then you also must know that I don't believe in providing explanations.
[29:38] Ahmed... do you know what happened?
[29:43] What happened now?
It's good news.
[29:48] I took Zara to the doctor. The doctor said that she was pregnant.
[29:54] You're about to become a grandfather.
[29:58] Is that the truth?
Why would I joke about this?
[30:06] Thank God. God is great!
[30:11] Will you keep sitting here? 
[30:13] Meet your daughter-in-law, buy sweetmeats for us!
[30:19] No... first I will offer prayers of gratitude, then I will buy the sweetmeats.
[30:28] Sit down, I'll be right back.
[30:31] Of course...
[30:50] I was the one who told mother. Otherwise no one noticed.
[30:53] Alright fine, you told us.
[30:56] No need to say it in front of everyone.
[30:59] She's right. You need to take care of yourself.
[31:03] You have Adeel's child with you. God have gifted you this support.
[31:07] God has helped you, now take care of yourself.
[31:12] Should I go to my room?
[31:14] I didn't ask you to rest. We would like it if you sit with us.
[31:21] Let her go auntie, she must be tired. Go Zara.
[31:26] Mirha take Zara away. Sadaf sit with her, she'll feel better if you sit with her.
[31:33] Go ahead.
[31:37] Come on.
[31:49] Fareeda, why are you creating a commotion?
[31:54] If you create such noise, then that girl will make you dance around her.
[32:08] I'll be right back.
[32:16] Do you see what mother is doing? It's an old habit of hers.
[32:20] She forgets everything.
[32:22] She didn't accept her when her son was alive.
[32:26] Why is she accepting her now? I told you to send her back, but no..
[32:31] She won't leave now. I don't think your mother will let her go now.
[32:37] Say positive things.
[32:47] My daughter was so happy.
[32:54] Are you...
[32:56] thinking what I'm thinking? Will we let her stay there?
[33:04] How can I leave my own child?
[33:08] Once Adeel's child is born, they are the ones that will keep the child.
[33:13] Talk to brother Ahmed, ask him to send Zara back.
[33:20] Don't look at me like this.
[33:24] I'll talk to them. I will bring her back. I would have brought her back right now if she hadn't refused.
[33:32] No.
[33:35] Don't talk to them. I'll talk to them.
[33:38] Indeed... I won't leave Zara there. No matter what anyone says.
[33:44] My child is about to become a mother, she needs someone to take care of her.
[33:50] I want her to be happy. Sister Fareeda might be in a good mood today, but if...
[33:58] she treats my daughter cruelly...
[34:03] I will bring her back here.
Nothing will happen to her.
[34:09] Everything will be fine, I'll talk to them.
[34:37] My dear can I come in?
[34:50] My dear... how are you feeling now?
[34:56] I'm fine uncle.
My dear, you didn't come to eat.
[35:02] I didn't feel like it.
[35:11] My dear, eat something.
[35:15] Otherwise you'll get sick.
[35:22] Your aunt gave me the news.
[35:27] I'm very happy.
[35:32] And... your auntie is very happy as well.
[35:36] I've seen her this happy for the first time in her life.
[35:47] My dear, did you call your family and tell them?
[35:59] You should have.
[36:01] After such a long time both families are getting such great news.
[36:12] I forgot what it was like to be happy.
[36:16] But this news has refreshed me.
[36:26] My dear, you have to be strong.
[36:33] I'm trying uncle.
[36:37] But no one can fill Adeel's absence.
[36:45] You're right, no one...
[36:49] can fill Adeel's absence, not even us.
[36:55] But my dear, we can't stop living our lives.
[37:04] And look... God...
[37:08] God have given you this happiness.
[37:12] God willing, you'll get the strength to fight your sadness.
[37:20] There is no better healer than time.
[37:25] With time our sadness fades away.
[37:33] Scars never leave us uncle.
You're right, they don't...
[37:40] God is giving you gift as well.
[37:52] Be strong.
[37:54] Am I not a father who is being strong as well?
[38:04] Be strong...
[38:09] I'll ask Mahi to bring something for you to eat.
[38:16] Eat something my dear.
[38:21] I'll go now.
[39:03] What are you doing here? Who asked you to cook dinner?
[39:09] Dinner is routine. Someone has to make it.
[39:12] I know how to make it.
[39:15] I can make it for myself.
[39:17] Your mother asked me to make it.
[39:20] I couldn't refuse.
Tell her that I asked you not to.
[39:24] I don't like someone else working in my kitchen.
[39:31] Your kitchen?
[39:34] I understand... here you go... carry on. Mother likes a soft diet,
[39:40]  if you don't understand anything you can ask me.
[39:42] Sure I will... she's been eating a soft diet for so long without getting better.
[39:51] You're getting angry, I was saying that because I was worried about her.
[39:57] What illness does she have? I never asked.
[40:04] It's not just one illness... there are lots of them.
[40:11] Actually... it started after father died.
[40:17] Sometimes I think it's because of father's death.
[40:21] Good wives are cared for by their husbands.
[40:25] Such wives can't live without them. Carry on.
