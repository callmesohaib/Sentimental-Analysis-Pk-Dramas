[00:58] What are you saying, Zaini?
[01:02] Something I haven't said until today. I have to say it today.
[01:08] Why did you do it, Saad?
[01:13] Zaini, this isn't true.
[01:16] Whatever we have seen, how will you say its a lie?
[01:23] How will you say its a lie, Saad? I've always asked you..
[01:29] But you never told me the truth.
[01:32] Even when I asked you, you never told me the truth.
[01:36] At least, tell me the truth now.
[01:44] Listen to me. Its nothing like what you've heard or seen.
[01:48] Whatever Saad is saying is the truth.
[01:51] What should I hear? I don't want to listen anything.
[01:57] He has always given my rights to you. He gave you the time I deserved.
[02:03] He got engaged to me because you told him to.
[02:06] He cared for me because you said so.
[02:09] This is because he loves you truly.
[02:11] I don't want a love I have to beg for.
[02:15] And Saad..
[02:18] Saad has never loved me.
[02:22] Because you have always been between us. You called him whenever you got a chance.
[02:29] What relationship did you have with him?
[02:31] Zaini, he's my friend.
[02:33] Friend?
[02:35] It isn't friendship when you forget everything.
[02:38] Even the man whose name is attached to yours.
[02:42] What right do you have to advocate for him? What right?!
[02:48] Zaini, how are you talking to Zara?
[02:49] This.. this is love. This is what is called love.
[02:57] This is love.
[03:00] I talked to Zara in a loud tone, he spoke up in her defense.
[03:06] And what about my broken heart?
[03:10] Can't you see that?
[03:12] Zaini, you're wrong.
[03:14] All of us are wrong here. Just the two of you are right.
[03:21] I'm your sister. How can you accuse me of something so dirty?
[03:26] You're not my sister. You could never be my sister.
[03:36] Rather than having a sister like you, it would have been better if you had died the day Adeel died.
[03:41] Zaini!
[03:42] Saad!
[03:44] How dare you touch my sister?
[03:47] Can't you see how she's talking to Zara?
[03:49] Saad before something really bad happens.. leave from here. Leave!
[04:49] Brother.. did anyone named Usama come here?
[04:53] No. Nobody named Usama came here.
[04:56] Alright.
[04:59] Is there any signal issue here?
[05:01] No signal issue usually but I've heard the signals have been weak today.
[05:08] If your car isn't here, please sit inside. I'll inform you.
[05:12] No brother. I'll go on a rickshaw myself. No problem.
[05:16] I'll call a rickshaw for you.
Thank you.
No brother. I'll go on a rickshaw myself. No problem.
[05:16] I'll call a rickshaw for you.
Thank you.
[05:30] Whats happening here?
[05:33] sister, thank God you're here. Please tell everyone that there is nothing between me and Saad and he's doing everything.
[05:43] What? What did you say? Between you and Saad?
[05:48] I'll tell you.
[05:51] Saad has destroyed your younger sister's life and he has tainted Zara for life.
[05:57] He has been keeping a bad eye on the girls in our house and now..
[06:02] when we have seen everything with our eyes, we believe it now.
[06:17] Saad? Is all this true?
[06:21] Maheen, trust me.. Can I do anything like this?
[06:26] Dad, listen to Saad once. What if he's telling the truth?
[06:33] So is Adnan lying?
[06:35] I'm not talking to you. Can you be quiet for a while?
[06:38] Why should I be quiet?
[06:40] Your sister is accusing my husband of something so sordid.
[06:45] She said that he had kept a dirty eye on her. She should have drowned before accusing him.
[06:51] And should I just be quiet and listen to her accuse my husband.
[06:55] Should I see a spectacle being made. Why couldn't she die before making such a big scene?
[07:01] Shaista, be quiet. For God's sake everyone be quiet.
[07:09] What is happening? Will someone tell me?
[07:12] Why is Saad being accused?
[07:14] I'll tell you whats going on.
[07:17] She has been having an affair with Saad since long and today Adnan caught them red handed.
[07:21] Maheen, this is a lie. There's nothing like this.
[07:24] Your husband is a liar. He's a cheap man.
[07:28] He distanced Zaini from me as well.
[07:31] You should be quiet!
[07:46] You have embarrassed me in front of everyone, Saad.
[07:51] Is this how you pay me back for my love?
[07:56] You have left me unable to show my face to anyone.
[08:01] I treated him like my son.
[08:04] I trusted him more than myself and he deceived me.
[08:11] The one I thought was loyal to my house and its savior,
[08:16] he turned out to be my enemy.
[08:21] Uncle..
[08:25] I'm not like this..
Quiet.
[08:43] Zaini
[08:48] You tell me. Is this all true?
[08:58] Why did you do it? Why?
[09:25] If you still don't believe me, I have proof.
[09:30] Look at that.
[10:03] Mom.. this
[11:38] Come mom.. the food is hot. I'll give you your medicine once you eat.
[11:43] Let Saad come and we'll eat together.
[11:46] Isn't he back yet? He is usually back by now. He's late.
[11:50] Did he go to Zara's?
[11:54] I don't know but if he does go, he messages me.
[11:58] I feel anxious.
[12:02] Where is he trapped?
[12:03] Mom, where would he be? There's so much traffic. You know they could get late.
[12:08] Hmm.. call him and ask where he is.
[12:24] His phone is switched off.
[12:27] God, where is my son?
[12:30] Mom, why are you worried? Nothing will happen. You have dinner then you need your medicine as well.
[12:37] Brother will come back home. Where else will he go?
[12:50] Here mom.. your tea.
[12:54] You made so much..
[12:55] Drink it and let me know how it is.
Alright.
[13:02] Hello mom.
[13:04] Hello. Shehla why are you all alone? Where is Usama?
[13:10] I don't know.
[13:12] What do you mean you don't know? I told him to pick you up once he drops Maheen.
[13:16] I called brother but his number is switched off so I came home myself.
[13:23] He isn't so careless.
[13:25] Let it be mom. He went with Maheen.. How could he remember?
[13:31] Alright. We'll ask him once he's back
[13:34] Let it be. They went after so many days.
[13:41] What is this? He can go wherever he wants but they should tell me.
[13:45] Give me my phone. I'll ask where he is.
[13:48] Now, do everything later. Give me something to eat.
[13:51] I had been at the salon since morning. I'm hungry now.
[13:55] Everything is ready. Freshen up and come. I'll serve.
[13:58] Sawera, get me my phone. I'll ask where they are.
[14:02] I'll go get it.
[14:04] Now tell me. Was everything done well?
[14:12] What will happen now?
[14:15] We'll be ridiculed Saad. What did you do, dear?
[14:21] Aunty..
[14:22] Don't call me aunty.
[14:25] What will I answer people who already doubted your relation? Tell me.
[14:31] You proved all of them right.
[14:35] Mom..
[14:37] Please don't say that. How can you even think that, mom?
[14:43] Mom, I didn't do anything. Trust me, please.
[14:47] I trusted you very much Zara. Both of you.
[14:52] You didn't even think about your sister. And you, Saad?
[14:58] You didn't think you had two relationships with this house? Your sister will be coming here.
[15:03] Aunty, please listen to me.
[15:05] What should I hear?
[15:07] My years old trust has died today. What should I hear?
[15:26] Saad has been accused.
[15:30] And now I want a way for Saad to stop coming here.
[15:36] And there is one way for that.
[15:39] Saad's relationship with this house should end.
[15:48] This is the only way, Saad's entry in this house will be blocked.
[16:02] Your phone.
Give it to me.
[16:05] I'll ask him.
[16:14] Where are you?
[16:15] Mom, actually I came to Maheen's house.
[16:18] Didn't I tell you, you had to pick Shehla?
[16:21] Mom.. it skipped my mind. But don't worry. I'll go and get her right away.
[16:25] Let it be. She's home.
[16:27] Mom, actually we didn't plan to come here. It was sudden. I'm very sorry.
[16:34] Now do you intend to come back home or will you be staying there?
[16:37] We'll be back in a while.
[16:39] Alright. Bye.
Yes.
[16:45] Whose call was it?
[16:47] Mom's.
[16:50] Actually I had to pick Shehla from the salon but it skipped my mind.
[16:55] So, are you leaving now?
[16:57] No. She's home. But she's home and mom's upset now.
[17:06] So will you go?
Why?
[17:09] aren't you coming along?
[17:11] No. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.
Alright.
[17:18] How is Zaini now?
[17:21] Zaini.. her room is locked and she isn't opening the door.
[17:26] I don't understand. What should I do?
[17:37] And Zara is still supporting Saad.
[17:37] I'm so worried. I don't believe whatever is happening.
[17:42] Yes. Even I don't understand anything
[17:46] I'll go and look at Zaini.
[18:01] What happened mom? Is everything alright?
[18:04] Yes it is.
[18:05] Then why aren't they here yet?
[18:07] They are at his in laws. His sister's engagement is round the corner and he's sitting with his in laws.
[18:12] Leave it mom. Let it be. She has visited her house after so many days. Its nothing.
[18:17] You're always supporting her and it is this reason why your brother is getting agitated by us.
[18:23] Whats wrong mom? Its nothing. You think about it.
[18:27] In fact, Usama has become more considerate towards us now and Maheen..
[18:30] Mom, Sawera is absolutely right.
[18:32] Why do you burn your blood thinking about it?
[18:36] Let it be.. I'll tell you a very interesting story about what happened in the salon..
[18:49] Uncle please make aunty understand. What is wrong with all of you?
[18:54] Why are you believing this outsider and not me?
[18:58] Adnan, isn't an outsider, Saad.
[19:09] Then who am I aunty? Who am I?
[19:13] Am I a stranger?
[19:16] You called me your son and you made me a stranger in a minute.
[19:23] Aunty I just have Zaini in my heart. Nobody else.
[19:28] Zara is my friend.
[19:31] I have always seen her as my friend. I've always supported her.
[19:35] She was worried today and I couldn't hold back and you're doubting us.
[19:42] You have no proof of whatever you're saying
[19:45] and even Zaini said you were involved with Zara.
[19:51] We found out today but Zaini has been tolerating everything since day one.
[19:58] Brother..
[20:00] Please stop it. Don't you feel ashamed thinking such a pathetic thing?
[20:07] What else can we do?
[20:12] Both of you haven't let us able to show our face to anyone.
[20:16] You've insulted us in the society.
[20:19] Brother we'll have to decide something. We can't let him go like this.
[20:26] I don't want to make tall claims but you should call his family
[20:31] and tell them how much we've been ridiculed. We cannot accept this ridicule ourselves.
[20:37] The way he has gotten our daughter ridiculed.
[20:39] Call his mother and call off this engagement.
[20:43] We cannot get our daughter married to such a man.
[20:50] Mom.. what is he saying?
[20:54] How can you give him such rights? Why don't you say something? Mom!!
[21:16] Mom!
[22:02] What are you doing?
I'm leaving from here.
[22:07] Where are you going?
[22:08] Wherever I can but I will not stay here. You..
[22:13] how can you trust Adnan uncle?
[22:15] Its not about Adnan anymore. Didn't you hear what Zaini said?
[22:19] You didn't listen to your sister?
[22:22] You never knew what your sister felt?
[22:26] You never saw.
[22:29] Then Saad isn't the only one at fault. You were always his accomplice.
[22:36] My sister in law was right.
[22:39] My upbringing lacked something.
[22:41] Mom, all this isn't true.
[22:44] And as far as Zaini is concerned, I'll talk to Zaini myself. She is also mistaken.
[22:47] I'll clear her misunderstanding but please don't call off their engagement. You'll wrong them.
[22:56] You never thought about your sister's relationship earlier.
[23:01] You're not trusting your daughter but you trust that guy.
[23:06] The man whom I've told you many times that he isn't a good guy.
[23:12] He looks at me with weird eyes and he has tried to hold my hand a couple of times.
[23:16] And that day, in the store.. he crossed all limits.
[23:19] I'm warning you. Don't you dare say such a sordid thing.
[23:26] Alright mom. Its over then.
[23:30] When its all my fault and everything happened because of me, why don't you let me go?
[23:36] I'm leaving mom. Its my fault. Everything happened because of me.
[23:39] I'll leave.
[23:42] But please don't do this to Saad. He didn't do anything. Its not his fault.
[23:48] Mom, we'll do what we have to do ourselves but you'll not take a step out of this house.
[23:56] Your dad will take all decisions
[23:59] Stop with this drama. Come down, your dad is calling you.
[24:03] Mom..
[24:15] Brother Manzoor, being silent won't do anything. You need to decide.
[24:20] What can we decide?
[24:23] Its not so easy to call off the engagement
[24:27] No matter what you decide.. I'll always be with you.
[24:32] I'll forget everything and stand with you.
[24:36] I trust you completely.
[24:38] Then what are you going to decide?
[24:40] We will not get our Zaini married to a guy whose already shady..
[24:46] Wait a minute. What are you saying?
[24:49] Its my life and I'll not let anybody else decide.
[24:53] So what can we do?
[24:55] When I know everything, I'll not get my daughter married to you.
[24:59] I'll never accept this accusation. Its a lie.
[25:05] Saad, things have gone further than whats true and whats false.
[25:09] Give me a chance at least.
[25:13] I did give you a chance.
Why should we give you a chance?
[25:15] So that you can get us insulted again?
Don't interfere.
[25:17] Why shouldn't I interfere?
[25:20] You falsely accused me and I shouldn't even interrupt.
[25:24] If someone had seen your true face, I'd..
[25:26] Did you see Manzoor? Did you see? He is threatening me in front of you.
[25:29] He tried to hit me earlier and now..
[25:34] Enough!
[25:37] Don't get me ridiculed in front of the world anymore.. I have no more strength.
[25:43] Uncle.. I've always taken you as my father. I cannot lie to you.
[25:49] Its my fault Saad. I treated you like my son.
[25:56] I put my daughter's happiness in your lap but
[26:00] I didn't know you'd let me down like this.
Uncle..
[26:07] You murdered relationships mercilessly.
[26:12] Uncle I swear. Zara is my friend, nothing else.
[26:18] Let me meet Zaini, once. You people don't believe me, alright. But Zaini will trust me.
[26:25] Let me meet her once. I'll not let you call off the engagement like this. Let me meet her once uncle.
[26:31] You cannot meet Zaini.
[26:33] Ali.. please, let me meet Zaini once. I'll make her understand.
[26:37] See, Saad. I have honor. I've already seen one of my sisters destroyed by you,
[26:43] I won't let it happen to the other one.
Ali please. Let me meet Zaini once.
[26:49] There's nothing to make her understand.
[26:52] You'll never be able to meet Zaini again.
[26:55] Please let me meet her once. Just once.
[26:58] Enough.
[27:01] I think you should leave from here. Come with your mother and sister.
[27:05] We'll discuss everything with them.
[27:07] Why don't you people believe me? Don't be so harsh.
[27:12] You're doing wrong trusting this cheap man.
[27:16] NCheap man? Am I the one? I have done everything?
[27:19] Mansoor, he never wanted to have this engagement.
[27:23] Do you remember when we wanted to get Ali married to Dolly..
[27:26] We talked about their wedding as well and he said no using job as an excuse.
[27:31] But now I know why he said no to it.
[27:34] Don't take things in another dimension. Everybody knows why I said no at that time.
[27:40] Everything came out clearly today. Before this, you had been fooling us.
[27:49] Are you saying this?
[27:50] Yes Saad. I'm saying this. You forced us for all this.
[27:54] Its my fault..
[27:59] I trusted you. I allowed you inside my house.
[28:05] There were no prohibitions whether it was day or night.
[28:10] People told me that we shouldn't trust strangers but I did..
[28:21] Its not entirely your fault, Manzoor.
[28:24] Even I'm at fault. I should have kept an eye.
[28:29] Everybody told me..
[28:32] Its not good that a sister in law is so friendly with her brother in law.
[28:36] But I never saw them that way. If I had, we wouldn't have seen this day.
[28:44] Who can we blame? Our own daughter was at fault.
[28:50] She ridiculed us in front of the entire world.
[28:52] You people are doing wrong. With us.
[28:56] Zara.. you say something please.
[29:00] Make them understand. Ask them to let me meet Zaini once. Make them understand
[29:05] Leave me.
[29:08] Nobody will understand us. Nobody. Can't you see?
[29:13] Didn't I tell you to not come meet me? Not talk to me. Didn't I say?
[29:18] What happened Saad? You told me everyone will believe me.
[29:22] But everybody believes uncle. Nobody even listened to me.
[29:28] I told you not to tell them anything. You said they'd support me. Did they support me?
[29:37] What happened Saad? I'm a spectacle now.
[29:42] Zara..
[29:43] Do you even know how much pain I am in? I'm being accused for breaking my sister's house.
[29:50] Whatever is happening, I'm being accused for it.
[29:54] And the accusations that have been made to me.. everybody blames them now.
[29:58] Zara, please don't cry. I cannot see you crying.
[30:02] What are you doing Saad?
[30:04] You're still sympathizing with me?
[30:12] Whatever happened is because you sympathized with me.
[30:16] Why don't you understand?
[30:22] Zara...
Stop this drama.
[30:26] If you respect us even a little, leave or else I'll do something.
[30:34] Leave!
[31:24] brother Manzoor..
[31:26] Whats happening to you? Dear, come here and help you dad. Please sit..
[31:35] Oh God..
[31:47] I never thought Saad would be like this.
[31:51] I told you earlier but you never listen to me.
[31:56] How would I know? I didn't dream that Saad would be like this.
[32:00] Whats wrong? Haven't you seen them together yourself so many times?
[32:04] I did but I never thought things would be so bad. 
[32:09] What will become of Zaini? I'm so worried about her.
[32:13] Nothing will happen with Zaini. I'm here. I'll think what needs to be done.
[32:17] Why have you thought? Brother Manzoor will think about them. 
[32:21] You don't need to have any thoughts.
[32:24] Stay as far away from this matter as possible. Don't harbor animosity without a reason.
[32:28] I've harbored animosity and I've waged a war. Now I need to end it.
[32:34] What did you say?
Nothing. I'll tell you later whatever I said.
[32:39] Its the limit.
What happened? Where are you running?
[32:44] I'm going to get the doctor. Please sit with dad for sometime
[32:49] Oh my God. What happened to my brother?
[32:51] Nothing aunt. He just has a little high blood pressure.
[32:54] I'll come with you.
[32:55] No. I'll go.
Its all because of Saad.
[32:59] Otherwise, how could my brother get sick all of a sudden..
[33:01] Whats wrong with you? He's worried and you're talking about Saad..
[33:06] Alright. I'll leave.
Yes dear. Get the doctor fast.
[33:11] Why do you have to talk about Saad?
[33:15] I just mentioned it. You're stretching it now. You say whatever you want to.
[33:19] Alright come. Lets look at your brother.
[33:22] This had to happen.
[35:20] Are you in your senses? You could have died in an accident.
[35:23] Its better if I had died.
[35:25] Wow.. what are you saying? Are you in your senses.
Don't do it.
[35:28] Sorry.. I didn't know when your car came in front of me.
[35:32] If you had died, your family would have blamed me.
[35:35] Let him go.
[35:36] Alright. God knows where they come from to die in the middle of the road.
[35:39] Be careful.. Try..
Are you hurt anywhere?
[35:47] Be careful..
Its alright. Sorry.
[37:01] Zaini.. Zaini please listen to me.
[37:07] I don't want to listen anything. Please leave
[37:12] Zaini, its a misunderstanding.
[37:18] How long should I be in this misunderstanding?
[37:21] Whatever you heard isn't true.
[37:25] Then what is the truth? You.. me.. Me or you.. Whose side is Saad on?
[37:35] Is he on my side or yours?
[37:37] Zaini, Saad is yours and he'll always be yours.
[37:43] Stop it. Stop telling fake stories.
[37:48] Zaini, don't be so harsh on yourself and on me.
[37:54] Whats wrong with you?
[37:58]  I'm the one who has lost everything.
You can stop everyone from doing this.
[38:04] Saad is only yours. He loves you. Whatever is happening is part of a plan.
[38:10] Plan?
[38:12] What plan?
Adnan uncle.. why don't you understand?
[38:17] Another lie? 
[38:20] Another accusation. Stop it Zara.
[38:24] To hid your sin, how low will you stoop?
[38:28] Enough Zaini. I didn't commit any sin.
[38:30]  Its all because of Adnan uncle. He planted doubt in everybody's heart, for Saad and for me.
[38:39] He loves you. He's yours. 
[38:42] He wants to talk to you. Talk to him and save your relationship. If you don't talk to him.
[38:47] Adnan uncle will succeed and everything will be destroyed.
[38:51]  Your engagement with Saad will be called off. Why don't you understand Zaini?
