[02:35] I am coming in a while
[02:37] what is this, he is asking me not to worry
[02:39] its not the matter to get worried, you are escalating the matter for no reason
[02:42] its been so late, Mahi
[02:45] rest here
[02:47] oho, my phone's battery has died. Mom must be worried for me
[02:53] how will you go home now?

[04:54] Saad, I know you met Zaini
[04:59] did she said something?
[05:01] or discussed something?
[05:04] is she fine?
[05:07] she doesn't want to see my face
[05:13] she has started hating me
[05:19] it will take some time for her to recover from the grief
[05:24] yes
[05:30] are you fine?
[05:34] I am fine
[05:37] and you?
[05:41] the way you are fine
[05:45] the same way I am fine
[05:56] the condition of both of us is same
[06:02] but maybe its my bad luck that...
[06:06] I have eaten your happiness
[06:08] its not only the fault of your luck in it
[06:14] also, my bad luck plays a vital role in it
[06:24] let me serve the dinner
[07:07] Greetings mom!
[07:08] Greetings!
[07:10] who is she?
[07:12] mom, she is my university friend. Since I got late today so she came to drop me
[07:17] aunty, my name is Sehrish. We study together
[07:20] actually we had an extra class today & Mirha had missed her point. So I came to drop her home
[07:25] I hope you don't mind
[07:26] what? Yes... Okay fine
[07:30] ok aunty, I am leaving now. Bye!
[07:33] thank you so much! Bye
[07:35] bye..
[08:02] by the way, well done!
[08:05] you've become friends with such a wealthy girl
[08:09] be quiet! for the first time in her life she did something great
[08:13] haven't you seen the car of that guy? It was so good
[08:17] leave the car & think about dad. Don't know where he must be wandering to search for her
[08:23] oh yes... call your dad & inform him that you've reached home
[08:28] my phone's battery is dead. Let me call from your phone
[08:31] my phone is inside, Go call him
[08:35] what is this in your hand?
[08:37] oh, I forgot to tell you. Its Sadaf's engagement's card
[08:41] day after tomorrow is her engagement. She had invited all of us
[08:43] show me
[08:46] Ok have a look, meanwhile let me get the phone
[08:52] I will go to this engagement ceremony for sure
[08:55] what will I wear?
[08:57] you are worried about your dress, they were such a wealthy people
[09:17] nobody came from your family today
[09:20] everyone was asking a lot
[09:23] So, I made an excuse that your father is not well
[09:28] you cover really well
[09:30] what are you saying, Maheen?
[09:32] if your parents didn't come, then obviously I had to make an excuse
[09:37] you should have made the people meet your mother, whoever were asking you
[09:41] she would have told them that why my parents didn't come
[09:44] what was the need for you to make a false excuse of my father's illness, tell me!
[09:51] what's wrong with you, Maheen?
[09:53] why do you always make a mountain out of hay?
[09:55] and from where my mother came in between? Why shall I ask her?
[10:00] because my parents didn't come here today because of her
[10:04] what are you saying?
[10:05] if you don't believe me then go & ask your mother
[10:08] she made me call them & ask them not to come
[10:11] are my parents so low-class that anyone can call & humiliate them whenever they want to?
[10:16] yes?
[10:18] No Maheen, I didn't know all this
[10:21] and if I would have known this, then I would have never let it happen
[10:24] why didn't you tell me this?
[10:28] how can mom say such things?
[10:32] because of Zara & Zaini
[10:35] will your mother keep taunting me like this, Usama?
when her taunts will end?
[11:00] here is your tea
[11:04] you've brought for me, but where is your tea?
[11:08] No...
[11:10] I don't feel like
[11:16] what's the matter, your mood seems a bit off since you've talked to Maheen
[11:22] is everything fine?
[11:27] I was thinking, until when we'll keep hiding our faces from the people?
[11:36] its good, Sarwat
[11:40] that they have stopped us to come over there
[11:45] we would have felt embarrassed if we would have gone there
[11:48] we would have felt embarrassed, even if we hadn't gone there
[11:51] but this is not the right way, Mr. Manzoor
[11:55] was it good for her to stop us in this manner? Does it look good?
[12:00] anyways, sometimes..
[12:04] we should ignore a few matters
[12:07] really?
[12:10] So, will you be able to ignore Zara & Saad's injustices with time?
[12:56] mom, what was the need for you to say all this?
[12:59] how will I face uncle & aunty now?
[13:01] so what's the need for you to answer them?
[13:04] their daughters are like that
[13:07] and why shall we get defamed because of them?
[13:10] mom, talk in a low tone. Maheen will hear us
[13:13] she can hear if she want to
[13:15] I didn't wanted anything inappropriate to happen in my daughter's engagement. That's why I didn't invited them
[13:20] and I don't regret about it
[13:23] and don't favor your in-laws too much in front of me
[13:27] they are you sisters! if you don't care about them then who else will?
[13:32] go & sleep now, its quite late night
[13:47] where is your lover?
[13:49] its been an entire month, I didn't see him visiting you
[13:53] what if he got to know about your reality
[13:56] to hell with him even if he got to know. I am not scared of anyone!
[14:00] I will be upset upon the fact, that I am left empty handed
[14:04] Why? Did you call him?
[14:06] I had called him many times, but his number is switched off
[14:09] but you used to say that he will give away his life for you
[14:11] will you give your life for any man if he will ask you to?
[14:14] No, right?
Nobody gives away their life for anyone
[14:18] all of these are bookish words
[14:20] leave him! if you cannot grab him then shall we find someone else?
[14:25] by the way, I have one. If you say so then shall I fix your meeting with him?
[14:28] absolutely! tell me who is he?
[14:31] actually..
[14:34] who can it be at this hour?
Wait, let me check
[14:39] who is it?
[14:41] Adnan
[14:48] Adnan has come
[14:49] such a long life he has...
[14:51] let it be. He will doubt if he sees you here
[14:55] do one thing, go from the back door. And listen!
[14:58] follow the plan strictly, ok?
[15:03] be quick
[15:16] oho...
[15:23] what happen?
[15:31] oh!
[17:02] Jamila, at least tell me what happened?
[17:07] You came after so many days to check on me
[17:10] what if something would have happened to me?
[17:13] God forbid, but nothing happened. At least tell me why are you crying?
[17:19] I had told you that I have to sell this house
[17:24] yes so?
[17:25] but now I cannot sell this house
[17:28] why?
[17:29] my mother's step brother has threatened me
[17:33] he said, if I won't give half of the money to him after selling this house
[17:38] then he will kill me
[17:40] how can he kill you like this? 
Are we following the jungle's rules?
[17:45] tell me his name & address, let me see. I have deal with so many people like him. Tell me
[17:50] No Adnan, you don't know him
[17:53] They are very dangerous & powerful people. You won't be able to compete them
[17:59] then what shall I do?
Shall I leave you to die?
[18:02] means, I shall die?
[18:04] ok then, let me die
[18:09] as it is whom do I have in this world for whom I shall live
[18:12] even you came to see me after a month. What difference does it make to you?
[18:17] what will I do Jamila if something happened to you?
[18:21] then save me, Adnan
[18:23] I want to spend my entire life with you
[18:26] it will happen this way. 
Try to offer some other deal to your mom's cousin
[18:35] He gave me an offer
[18:40] what?
[18:41] he said, whatever the value is of this house as per date
[18:46] if I give some jewelry or half of the amount to him accordingly then he will spare me
[18:56] then?
[18:57] what I could have said?
[18:58] neither I have the jewelry or amount
[19:01] if I only have something, then its the documents of this house
[19:05] if anyone can lend me the jewelry & amount after keeping the papers as mortgage
[19:10] maybe my problem will be solved
[19:13] nobody will give even a glass of water to this single woman
[19:16] and here we are talking about million of rupees
[19:21] what shall I do?
[19:23] oh Jamila, at least don't cry for God sake. Let me think something
[19:28] please don't cry, let me do something
[19:31] don't cry, I cannot see you crying
[19:58] yes Asfa, greetings!
[20:01] I wanted to discuss an important matter with you
[20:04] if the matter is related to Zara, then we don't have any interest in her
[20:10] don't talk anything about her
[20:13] if the matter had been only about Zara, then I would have never called you
[20:20] but the matter is about your son & my daughter
[20:25] and I think, you might have not turned your face against your son
[20:32] what do you mean, I didn't get what you are trying to say
[20:36] As per Ali's condition, we have fulfilled our promise
[20:40] but you guys haven't contacted us as of yet
[20:43] yes yes... you are right
[20:48] actually we got so busy that we couldn't think about it
[20:52] really! but I thought your child is the most precious thing to you
[20:58] anyways, I am not interested in beating about the bush
[21:02] I just wanted to ask you, when are you coming for the wedding procession to my house with your son?
[21:08] Asfa, we haven't decided anything as of yet
[21:12] then think about it
[21:15] anyways, whether you accept it or not but Zara is your bloodline
[21:21] and when blood relations get hurt
[21:25] then the parents gets hurt the most
[21:30] what are you trying to say? Say it clearly
[21:33] I want to say, bring your son's wedding procession to my house
[21:38] otherwise, I will depart your daughter from here
[21:41] if my daughter cannot live a happy married life, then your daughter also doesn't have a right to stay married happily
[21:49] I will wait for your answer, bye!
[22:17] Zara won't go anywhere
[22:20] are you guys listening? 
Zara will not go anywhere, She is my wife
[22:24] and if you guys uttered a single word against Zara then I will leave this house
[22:31] and Zara will go with me
[22:40] mom, with whom you were talking?
[22:43] when did you come?
[22:45] I am asking you, with whom you were talking? Who was on the call?
[22:48] I had called sister Sarwat
[22:50] why?
[22:51] what do you mean why?
[22:54] your sister is in a bad condition while crying continuously
[22:57] can't you see her? For what you are punishing her?
[23:01] mom, is this the time to discuss such things?
[23:05] and they...
[23:06] Enough is enough!
[23:09] I have become deaf by hearing it
[23:12] if this girl's character is not good then why shall my daughter..
[23:15] Mom...
don't you dare, Saad
[23:17] will you talk in such a high tone in front of your mother?
[23:20] mom, Zara is not characterless
[23:23] Your mother-in-law was absolutely correct!
[23:27] that in whichever house you'll go, you'll ruin the peace of that house
[23:31] you've completely changed since the day this girl came in this house
[23:36] mom, for God sake don't say such things
[23:45] wow brother!
[23:47] today you've crossed all the limits
[23:50] people say it right
[23:52] One dirty fish spoils the whole pond
[23:55] Dolly!
[23:57] why?
[23:58] why are you quiet now? Speak up
[24:01] please stop it. Aunty, you don't need to fight because of me
[24:06] aunty, I will go away from here. Please don't fight because of me
[24:09] Zara, I am talking
[24:11] then go away! For God sake go away from here
[24:17] a wretched girl like you should leave
[24:20] Zara won't go anywhere
[24:23] are you guys listening? 
Zara will not go anywhere, She is my wife
[24:27] and if you guys uttered a single word against Zara then I will leave this house
[24:33] and Zara will go with me
[24:35] and if you want to wed off Dolly, then do it
[24:39] I will fulfill my duty as a brother, as well as a son
[24:42] I will fulfill everyone's right
[24:52] also of a husband too
[26:21] drink water
[26:25] I don't want
[26:27] drink some
[26:37] how much you'll tolerate because of me, Saad?
[26:46] whatever mom said to you was wrong
[26:50] she shouldn't have said this
[26:51] it doesn't make any difference to me now
[26:54] but I cannot tolerate wrong words
[26:57] wrong?
[27:04] there is no differentiation between right or wrong anymore
[27:10] its too late now, Saad
[27:18] and I have accepted this reality
[27:21] that our life's decision is not in our hands
[27:26] what are you trying to say?
[27:30] don't spoil the rest of your relations because of me
[27:33] and what about the relation we have?
[27:37] whether we don't accept this reality or relation with our heart
[27:41] but we cannot deny this reality that you are my wife
[27:46] and I don't do dishonesty in relations
[27:50] and you know it very well
[27:52] some relations...
[27:55] die after getting under the burden of pressure
[28:03] and our relation
[28:06] our relation is very weak
[28:12] because of this weak & delicate relation
[28:17] don't spoil the rest of your relations, please
[28:54] mom, did you call me?
[28:56] yes, sit down. I want to discuss something important with you
[29:00] yes mom, even I want to discuss something important with you
[29:03] yes tell me
[29:05] mom, I have decided this after thinking so much that...
[29:09] I am setting Dolly free from this relation
[29:13] what!
[29:16] what are you saying?
Are you in your senses?
[29:20] I am saying the right thing, mom
[29:23] I cannot see Zaini in pain
[29:25] if Dolly will come to this house, it means Saad will also keep visiting this house
[29:29] Zaini had to face him
[29:32] which I don't want
[29:33] really?
[29:35] and by doing this all the problems will be solved?
[29:40] maybe
[29:41] neither we make relations or break them on the basis of maybe
[29:47] and why will we punish Dolly?
[29:50] remember one thing
[29:52] today, if we'll do wrong with someone's daughter then our daughters won't live in peace as well
[30:00] If we can save the relations by keeping our ego & anger aside. 
[30:05] then we should handle the matter with patience & tolerance
[30:11] instead of running away from the situation & problems like cowards
[30:19] I won't allow you to do this
[30:22] but mom, what about Zaini?
[30:26] Zaini is very brave & courageous girl
[30:31] she is my daughter, I will handle her
[30:36] Zaini is not so weak that she will get shattered by some storm
[30:39] she is my daughter, & I know her
[30:44] I am here if something happens, I will handle her
[30:51] we have decided
[30:54] soon we'll take your wedding procession there
[31:15] today for the first time in my life my son has talked to me in this tone
[31:24] mom, why are you hurting yourself?
[31:28] what are you hoping now?
[31:33] brother has changed
[31:35] he is only Zara's husband now
[31:41] he isn't your son or my brother
[31:43] what wrong have I said?
[31:45] what wrong have I said?
[31:47] I just wanted you to get married & go to your husband's house
[31:54] and I have said the same thing to Zara
[31:57] but she didn't do anything
[32:00] somebody had to take an initiative, so I did
[32:05] did you get any answer?
[32:07] No... I don't think so that you'll get an answer
[32:11] God forbid Dolly, why are you saying such things?
[32:15] will my fate become good by talking good?
[32:22] already I didn't had a father
[32:27] I just had one brother & now...
[32:42] mom
[33:00] mom, I want to apologize to you
[33:05] forgive me
[33:11] and Dolly
[33:16] I'm sorry
[33:19] on whom's order you've come to apologize?
[33:22] of no one
[33:25] you know, nobody can dictate me anything
[33:34] but I didn't like to misbehave with you guys
[33:48] Saad, you have changed quite a lot within a few days
[33:52] so much?
[33:55] I haven't changed
[33:59] I am your same old son, Saad
[34:16] the only difference is that
[34:19] both of you are blind folded
[34:32] its sister Sarwat's call
[34:38] hello!
[34:42] yes
[34:52] what happen, mom?
[34:54] what was she saying?
[34:57] she said that they will bring the wedding procession day after tomorrow
[35:01] really?
[35:02] yes... they are bringing wedding procession
[35:06] really?
[35:07] yes
[35:08] mom
[35:10] my child.. 
[35:16] thank God!
[35:19] God is great
[36:17] don't worry
[36:20] I have talked to mom & Dolly
[36:22] they have agreed
[36:26] how did you convince them?
[36:29] I haven't convinced them, they got a call from your family
[36:33] from my house? Who called?
[36:36] aunty had called
[36:39] they have decided day after tomorrow for the wedding
[36:43] so my parents have agreed?
[36:45] yes
[36:48] its such a good news
[36:52] did anyone ask about me?
[36:56] they haven't discussed anything in front of me
[37:06] fix your mood now
[37:08] I am fine
[37:10] I am so happy for Dolly from my heart
[37:13] I know
[37:47] why are you quiet?
[37:50] just like that
[38:08] everything has changed a lot, right Zara?
[38:15] earlier, we used to share every matter so easily with each other
[38:21] now even after staying under one roof
[38:25] we are living like two strangers
[38:34] we were friends earlier as well, Zara
[38:39] then why such a big gap came in between us?
[38:49] can't we be friends like before?
[38:57] I need my friend, Zara
[39:04] please
[39:07] please, return my friend to me
[39:09] return my friend
[39:16] please
[39:24] will you return her to me?
[39:39] thank you!
