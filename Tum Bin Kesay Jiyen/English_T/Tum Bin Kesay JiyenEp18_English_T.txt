[00:21] Tell him that he has just got married so he should come home before dusk.
[00:29] There are so many evil things outside.
[00:32] Take tea.
[00:34] I don't know whether it's good or not because Zara didn't make this.
[00:41] May God forgive your grandma, she didn't let me go out of the house during first month after my marriage.
[00:50] But the boys and girls these days, they don't care about anything, they wander outside.
[01:05] Didn't you understand that what was Zara saying to you?
[01:09] What did she say?
[01:12] She was telling you that her mother has taught her to respect elders and obey them.
[01:18] But you couldn't teach anything to your children
[01:20] that's why at the same time Adeel was arguing with you that Zara won't put off flowers.
[01:25] Do you remember that?
[01:27] She has taunted you and disgraced you.
[01:32] Yes you are right.
[01:34] And she also told us that she is not doing this happily.
[01:39] I told you that she is so sharp.
[01:46] She has just got married and she has started to show her real face.
[01:52] It doesn't make any difference.
She was not less than this before her marriage.
[01:57] She was taunting you that your children are disobedient.
[02:01] Perhaps she has forgotten that she is in this house only because Adeel didn't obey you.
[02:05] Yes.
[02:07] She is so confident because of his support.
[02:12] My own son has humiliated me.
[02:16] That's why she is riding over my head.
[02:19] I am telling you that don't mention this "amulet" thing directly.
[02:24] Wait for the right time.
[02:26] Act very thoughtfully, you don't have to be in a hurry but you.
[02:31] So you have asked Bushra to come here tomorrow.
[02:35] Now let's see how Adeel obeys her.
[02:42] We will have to do something.
[02:55] Did you see, Zaviar got convinced. You were so nervous for no reason.
[03:03] So you should start the process of selling that land.
[03:07] I don't think this is right.
[03:11] This land is the property of Zaviar's mother.
[03:14] You belong to old school of thought.
[03:19] We won't waste his money.
[03:21] We will invest that money in a profitable investment.
[03:25] So what's the issue with it?
Oh.
[03:29] You can never understand.
[03:32] OK then, just end this topic here.
[03:37] Did you talk to Farah?
Yes, Farah called me yesterday.
[03:42] She told me that it's difficult for them to come here this here because Rehan's leaves are not approved.
[03:46] Hmm.
[03:48] It happens when children live far away.
Yes you are right.
[03:54] I think you should talk to Ayan. How long will you be angry with him?
[04:00] No, it is not possible at all.
[04:04] I don't want to talk to him.
[04:08] Only Zaviar is my son now.
[04:11] I am happy with her happiness.
[04:15] I always want to see him happy.
[04:26] I think, there is no need to talk to Dolly at the moment.
[04:31] If you will say anything then obviously she will say something as well.
[04:34] That will create problem.
Yes, I was thinking in the same way.
[04:38] That both of them are in angry mood now.
[04:40] So it is better to keep quiet at the moment.
[04:43] Did you talk to Ali about this matter?
No.
[04:46] Why would he talk to me? He talked to Maheen.
OK.
[04:53] Why don't they think?
[04:55] That there minor things can effect our life and Ali and Dolly's life.
[05:01] Why would anyone think about it?
[05:05] It's bitter thing but true.
[05:08] We will have to think about us by ourselves.
[05:10] Just like Zara and brother Adeel thought about themselves.
[05:14] Whereas brother Adeel's family was trying hard to break their marriage.
[05:20] Did you talk to Zara?
[05:22] How is she?
Why? Don't you talk to her?
[05:28] I don't call her.
[05:31] You don't call Zara, it means that you don't talk to her.
[05:35] How will anyone believe on this that you are asking me about her well being. Wow.
[05:40] I am right.
[05:42] Now, I don't talk to her.
[05:44] Why don't you talk to her?
[05:45] Listen, brother Adeel is a very nice person.
[05:47] You should talk to her, he will never mind that.
[05:50] It's not because of Adeel.
[05:53] I don't talk to her because of myself.
[05:56] So, did you fight with her again?
[05:58] I didn't fight with her.
So, why don't you talk to her?
[06:02] If I will talk to her then I will want to meet her.
[06:07] Let me tell you a strange thing.
[06:13] I went to meet her in makeup room on her wedding day.
[06:20] I felt so strange.
[06:24] I felt as if everything may stop and Zara will stay with me.
[06:30] And she may not go anywhere.
[06:34] It's so strange.
[06:37] But I didn't want that she get married.
[06:43] She stays here and doesn't go far away from me.
[06:50] Why?
[06:53] Why did you feel that way?
I felt that way.
[07:02] I miss her so much.
[07:14] What's the matter Zenny? Why are you quiet?
[07:20] We should go home. Mom must be waiting for me.
[07:35] What's written in it? What is it about?
[07:40] What do you think, what is it about?
[07:44] I have found it from my daughter-in-law's room so it's obvious that it must be against me.
[07:48] I think it must be for controlling my son and taking him far away from me.
[07:54] God forbid.
[07:56] There is nothing like that. It's just for protection from evil sight.
[08:00] Your daughter-in-law doesn't want to destroy your house.
[08:05] She wants to protect your house.
[08:07] Why are you saying this?
[08:12] It's a sin to doubt and falsely accused someone.
[08:18] You should repent in front of God.
[08:25] Huh, it's an amulet.
[08:35] How much?
[08:38] It's not high, it's low.
[08:43] It's not low Adeel. Let me see it.
[08:48] Is this less?
[08:50] You have got 102 degree fever.
[08:53] It's obvious.
[08:55] It can't be 102.
You are still joking.
[08:59] You are having such a high fever. We should go to doctor immediately.
[09:02] I will ask uncle, he is at home.
[09:05] Why would I go to doctor? I am a doctor myself.
[09:08] It is clearly evident that what kind of doctor you are.
[09:12] I don't know what you must do to your patients.
[09:22] I will be perfectly alright.
[09:26] Why are you panicking?
[09:27] I am not panicking. You are having such a high fever.
[09:31] Adeel, I gave you that "amulet", where is that?
[09:37] That one
[09:41] I think, I forgot that where did I put that.
[09:43] Adeel, such things are so important and we should take care of that.
[09:50] Do you remember, where did you put that.
[09:54] Anyways, just leave that. You don't listen to me.
[10:19] Let's go to doctor.
No, there is no need for that.
[10:24] You are having such a high fever.
[10:28] As I told you that I will be perfectly alright. Don't worry.
[10:43] Zenny.
[10:52] Did you mind my words?
[10:54] No.
[10:56] You didn't talk to me on the way back to home. You kept quiet.
[11:01] As I said that I didn't mind anything.
[11:10] Ever since I have talked about Zara, your mood has changed.
[11:16] Will you come in?
[11:24] No, I am leaving.
[11:57] Mahi
[12:00] Mahi.
What happened?
[12:02] Adeel is not feeling well?
What happened to Adeel?
[12:06] He was perfectly fine yesterday and you went for outing. Right?
[12:09] He is suffering from high fever since last night. Where is aunt?
Fever?
[12:14] Mom has gone out with aunt Bushra.
[12:17] How did he get fever?
[12:19] He was perfectly alright last night and how do I know about reason of his fever.
[12:23] What do you mean? Who else will know other than you?
[12:27] Mahi, how can I tell you the reason of his fever?
[12:30] You must have know about that but maybe you don't want to tell me.
[12:35] Please call aunt. I am trying to call her but unable to connect.
[12:39] I don't understand you.
[12:41] You get worried on such minor things.
[12:44] Adeel get fever like this. He must have eaten some cold thing which must have effected his throat.
[12:49] Go and sit with him. I will bring black tea.
Thank you Mahi.
[12:54] No need to thanks.
[12:57] If you face any problem in this house then come to me.
[13:02] Don't be so formal with me.
[13:07] OK.
Go, I will bring black tea.
[13:10] Right.
[13:49] Why isn't he receiving my call?
[13:54] Let me send him voice note.
[14:00] Aqib, it's Mirha. It's my new number. Save this number.
[14:05] And why aren't you receiving my calls? I am calling you continuously.
[14:10] I am so worried. Is everything alright?
[14:14] Contact me as soon as you see this message.
[14:18] And save my number.
[14:31] Come here.
I am here.
[14:40] All my time is wasted.
[14:43] There was nothing.
[14:45] That was for protection from evil sight.
Well, is she Adeel's mother to do that.
[14:54] All my time wasted and I didn't get anything.
[14:59] That's why I asked you to get that checked first.
Hey, fool girl.
[15:04] Does your brain work or not?
[15:07] That's why I asked you that from where did you find that "amulet"
[15:12] If there was any such "amulet" then she wouldn't have put that on dressing table.
[15:16] Yes, I told you about that.
[15:18] But you became so excited when you saw that.
[15:20] When you know about my nature then why did you give me that "amulet".
[15:29] OK leave it. Tell me, why did you come back?
[15:32] You should have given that cleric some amount to give you a false amulet.
[15:36] And he would also become witness for you.
What?
[15:39] A few thousand rupees.
[15:42] He wouldn't even look towards that money.
[15:45] He was not greedy of money. He has such a big bungalow.
[15:50] There were four cars in his garage.
[15:53] Money is not important for him.
[15:57] And what do you think that I didn't talk to him.
[16:01] I talked to him.
[16:02] He humiliated me so much that I can't tell you.
[16:07] Bushra was laughing and I was so embarrassed that I can't tell you.
[16:15] Don't laugh.
[16:18] OK fine, don't think about it and shoot up your blood pressure.
[16:23] Go and meet your son, he is not feeling well.
[16:26] He didn't go to hospital today.
[16:29] Oh my God, what happened to him? Is he alright?
[16:32] What's wrong with you? Just relax.
[16:35] Why do you become so excited.
[16:37] He is suffering from fever. There is nothing serious. Go and see him.
[16:42] And that madam must be in room since morning
[16:45] and must be trying to win his heart by serving him.
[16:48] Anyways, come with me.
[16:51] Let's see Adeel.
[16:53] I met him in the morning and also met him a short while ago so I am not going.
[16:57] It's the limit.
[17:17] I have a good news.
[17:20] An issue is about to be created in the lives of Zenny and Saad.
[17:24] Because of Zara.
[17:27] Because of Zara?
[17:31] Yes because of Zara, will it happen because of me?
[17:36] What's happened?
Nothing.
[17:39] It's just a light smoke.
[17:43] There is some time left.
[17:46] And when the fire will be ignited.
[17:49] Then I will also enjoy that moment but at the moment just wait and see.
[17:57] Be careful, you may not entangle yourself in that.
[18:01] And then people enjoy watching your scene.
[18:03] What are you saying?
[18:07] Me? I am Adnan.
[19:04] I went to meet him in makeup room on her wedding day.
[19:11] I was feeling so strange.
[19:15] I wanted that everything may stop and Zara stays with me and doesn't go anywhere.
[19:28] It's a strange thing.
[19:31] But I wanted that Zara may not get married.
[19:37] And she stays here.
[20:00] Are you happy now? You make him sick. Are you content now?
[20:07] What's the matter?
[20:08] You are asking me this question as if you don't know that what's the matter.
[20:14] You keep roam around him round the clock.
[20:17] You stay with him in this room and you are asking this question from me.
[20:21] May God forgive me, I haven't seen him thoroughly ever since he has got married.
[20:27] He hardly greets me. I don't know what have you done to him.
[20:32] Aunt, please speak in lower voice. Adeel has slept with great difficulty. He is not feeling well.
[20:37] What do you mean?
[20:39] Am I here to disturb him? Am I bothering him?
[20:44] You have just got married and now you will teach me that how to take care of my son.
[20:52] The day has past, my son is ill but you didn't let me know.
[21:00] Why? What do you want?
[21:03] Aunt, I don't want anything. I went to your room to inform you but you were not at home
[21:07] and uncle is not at home as well.
[21:10] I was not at home but I didn't die.
[21:14] Why didn't you inform me by calling me that Adeel is not feeling well?
[21:17] What do you want to prove? What do you want to prove?
[21:22] That only you can take care of Adeel.
[21:24] We can't take care of him. I can't take care of him.
[21:28] Remember one thing.
[21:31] You are just his wife but I am his mother.
[21:36] Even if strongest person falls ill then he calls his mother.
[21:44] Zara
[21:46] Yes Adeel.
[21:47] Where are you going? Take a side, let me see him.
[21:51] Aunt, Adeel asked me to come to him.
[21:54] I told you that I will see him.
[21:57] Zara you go and eat something.
[22:01]  You haven't eaten anything. Take care of yourself. I will take care of Adeel.
[22:07] You called me Adeel.
[22:08] I will see him. What happened to you?
[22:12] Oh my God, my son fell ill but no one even bothered to inform me.
[22:17] He has got a very high fever.
[22:22] Have you eaten anything?
[22:23] Has Zara given you anything to eat?
[22:25] No, I don't want to eat anything.
[22:27] Why don't you want to eat? You are sick and you haven't eaten anything.
[22:32]  Zara go and bring hot glass of milk and biscuits.
[22:38] I will feed him myself. Why won't he eat?
[22:43] And listen, bring a hot cup of tea for me. I am having severe headache.
[22:48] OK.
Oh God.
[22:51] My son is sick and in pain but no one even bothered to inform me.
[22:56] At least you should have called me. No one informed me that you are having such a high fever.
[23:03] Mom, don't worry.
[23:06] It's a normal fever, I will be alright.
My son.
[23:09] Fever is not normal.
[23:12] Don't take such things that much lightly. Take care of yourself.
[23:19] May you get my life. Zara didn't inform me.
[23:35] My dad was against such friendships. Such friendships are not good.
[23:43] No one thinks about such things these days. 
[23:46] Saad and Zara are very good friends.
[23:49] They roam around with each other and do whatever then want but no one say anything.
[24:18] Zara.
Yes.
[24:20] What are you doing in kitchen?
[24:22] I am making tea for aunt and boiling milk for Adeel.
[24:26] Yes I can see that but why are you doing this? You have just got married.
[24:30] Aunt asked me to do that.
Mom, forgets everything in panic situation.
[24:35] First you have to do rituals.
[24:37] First bride makes a dessert then she will manage household chores.
[24:41] Don't you know about it?
[24:43] I know but I came here when aunt asked me to do that.
[24:47] Anyways, I will do that. Go and sit with Adeel.
I will do that.
[24:52] No, I will do that.
[24:54] Go and spend time with Adeel.
[24:57] Zara listen to me.
[24:58] I came here to take Mirha's food. Give her that.
[25:02] Take out from fridge. I will heat that up.
[25:05] Where is spoon?
[25:13] I can't speak any louder than this. The door is opened, someone can listen.
[25:18] I was telling you that Mahi has completely suspicious about you.
[25:22] She thinks that you are a partner of those robbers.
What?
[25:25] Have your family members lost their minds?
[25:28] How can they blame me for that?
[25:31] And on which basis? Why would I do that?
[25:33] I am not talking about all my family members, I am just mentioning Mahi.
[25:36] She has asked neighbors to check their CCTV.
[25:40] She was asking about you and I have told her everything.
[25:44] Wait, what did you tell her about me?
I told her the truth.
[25:49] And she wants to meet you.
[25:52] For investigation?
No, she just wants to meet you.
[25:56] Aqib, I think someone is coming. I will talk to you later.
[26:00] Just wait.
[26:01] How would anyone know that with whom are you talking?
[26:03] Tell me the whole story.
If I am caught then I will be in trouble.
[26:07] I will talk to you later. Bye.
[26:13] Take it away.
What happened?
[26:20] We are in trouble.
[26:26] Sister, you have brought food for me but I don't want to eat.
[26:31] Mahi told me that you have to eat before taking medicine. Eat a bit
[26:37] OK, I will eat it. Thank you.
You must eat it.
[26:48] I have no privacy in this house.
[26:55] Ever since you have got married. You are sick.
[26:59] Zara doesn't take care of you. You should take care of yourself.
[27:04] And if you fell ill then you should take medicine immediately.
[27:10] At least you wouldn't fall this much ill.
[27:14] Mom.
Hey.
[27:16] I sent Zara to bring this.
[27:17] But you have brought it. Where is she?
You amazed me.
[27:20] You sent newly wed bride to kitchen.
[27:23] At least let her make dessert first.
[27:25] Oh, I forgot Mahi.
[27:32] I became anxious after seeing him in this condition.
[27:36] I forgot everything.
[27:40] You did right by forbidding her. I don't know what would her mother think.
[27:44] She will taunt us that you asked my daughter to manage household chores.
[27:49] So let's ask her to make dessert today.
[27:53] Then you can ask her to do anything.
Yes, you are right.
[27:58] Do you have any objection Adeel?
[28:01] Why would I object mom?
[28:05] Let me feed him.
[28:07] Come on good boy.
[28:09] Come on good boy, open your mouth and eat a bit.
[28:15] Did you see, he ate. She was telling me that he isn't eating anything.
[28:19] Listen, where is Zara? Ask her to sit with us.
[28:24] Zara is in Mirha's room.
[28:26] She wants to discuss something important with her.
[28:29] It's so strange.
[28:31] When they were getting married then I used to think that me and Zara will become good friends.
[28:36] But Mirha has won.
[28:38] Both have become good friends.
[28:41] Really?
[28:43] That's good if they have become friends.
[28:47] But let me tell you
[28:50] I don't like such kind of friendships.
[28:54] It is said that married girls should make friendship with married girls.
[28:59] Unmarried girls don't take good effect from such kind of friendships.
[29:04] My dad was against such friendships. They should be careful. 
[29:10] Such friendships are not good.
[29:13] But no one thinks that way these days.
[29:15] Saad and Zara are very good friends.
[29:18] They roam around and do whatever they want but no one says anything.
[29:32] Hmm. Eat it my son.
[29:45] Zara, where are you?
[29:49] If it was only about me then I wouldn't say anything.
[29:52] But
[29:53] Zenny has to go to that house after marriage.
[29:56] So please, I want you to handle this matter yourself.
[30:02] No my son, if it was only your case then I would say the same thing.
[30:06] That this shouldn't happen.
[30:10] Anyways, I will talk to Maheen and Dolly. Don't worry.
Thanks dad.
[30:15] When will you go back. Today or tomorrow?
[30:17] I will have to go today. I will join tomorrow.
[30:23] So
[30:25] Why don't you come back to Karachi? You can get any good job here.
[30:31] And there is no need for any job.
[30:34] Our expenses are managed through rents of shops.
[30:38] And you can start a business from my savings.
[30:46] Dad, you are right.
[30:49] But I want to do job at the moment.
[30:51] I will tell you whenever I need anything.
[30:55] OK, as you wish.
[30:58] Tell me whenever you want.
[31:02] Everything is belonged to you my son.
I know dad.
[31:06] Thanks.
[31:26] Did you wash the clothes?
Yes.
[31:32] It seems as if the light of this house has gone after Zara's marriage.
Obviously.
[31:38] Whenever someone leaves the house then it happens.
[31:43] Yes, I am saying this. 
[31:46] Saad has stopped to come here.
[31:51] But it's good for you.
[31:54] You and Saad will get a chance to understand each other.
[32:02] And it's very important for you.
[32:09] Why do I talk to you candidly?
[32:12] Listen, your uncle told me that there is some conflict between you and Saad.
[32:21] What do you mean?
He was cleaning his vehicle.
[32:24] So he heard your conversation.
[32:27] That you and Saad argued because of Zara.
[32:32] There is nothing like that.
[32:36] And tell uncle that he don't have to worry about that.
[32:43] Yes I told him the same thing but listen
[32:48] Earlier, Zara lived here and if there was anything then it would remain within this house.
[32:54] But now she is in her in-laws' house. God forbid if any mishap happened
[32:58]  and her mother-in-law knows that then what would she think and that will create problem for Zara.
[33:03] What will happen between Saad and Zara? 
[33:07] I don't understand, what are you trying to say?
Nothing.
[33:12] As I told you that your uncle heard your conversation.
[33:16] And he shared that with me.
[33:18] And I shared that with you. That's it.
Listen aunt.
[33:22] Tell uncle that talk to me directly in such situation.
[33:27] Because fire won't ignite if will try to ignite that.
[33:30] Hey, you became angry.
