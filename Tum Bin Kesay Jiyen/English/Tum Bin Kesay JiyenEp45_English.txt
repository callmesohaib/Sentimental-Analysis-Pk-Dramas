Ali, dear, why did you have to be so formal? What was the need?
Aunty, mom has sent these and you'll have to eat them.
How can I eat all this all alone?
You will have to. You need to take care of your diet.
Only then will your weakness will subside.
And if you don't eat, I'll take you home with me.
Mom will take care of you then.
My child..
How can I thank you for all your love and kindness?
I can just pray for your happiness and prosperity. Amen.
How is Zara?
Zara, is good.
She is thinking to work a job.
Job? Why?
Actually, dad wanted Zara to get married again.
And she isn't agreeing for it. She is thinking to work somewhere.
Ali, you need to make her understand.
What will people say if she works a job?
People? Who people and what will they say?
Its good that she wants to work. I don't see anything bad in it.
No. It isn't bad. Nobody has worked in our families that's why..
Yes, you're right.
But nobody in our family ever needed to work.
Maheen and Zara got married young and Zaini is still studying.
We never discussed this.
And if Zara has an option now, I don't think there is anything bad about it.
As it is, today girls are greater in numbers as compared to men in the field.
Even in our office, we have 60% girls.
Ali is right. Whether its a girl or a boy, they should work. It gets them everything.
And if Zara works, she'll get distracted, its good.
Yes aunty.. this is what dad thought before allowing her.
Alright, what about your job? How is it going?
Yes aunty, its going well.
Will you keep talking or will you get something? Ali is here..
let me bring tea, sorry
thank you!
in fact you should have dinner before you leave.
No aunty.. it'll get late.
Come fast dear.. And tell me how is your mother?
No Saad don't come again. Don't.
Sometimes we need to leave friends behind to save relationships.
Hello?
How are you Zaini?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine too. I have to talk to you.
Tell me, what is it?
Did you say something to Zara?
No. Why did she say something to you?
Zaini, tell me the truth, did you say something to Zara?
So what?
Saad, I didn't say anything to Zara. And even if I did.. what would you do?
Zaini, this isn't the answer to my question.
Then you tell me, what should I say?
Zaini, Zara is very upset and she isn't talking to me at all. I don't know what did she not like.
Tell me did something happen at home?
You're so worried about Zara.
If only..
you only worried a little about me.
Zaini, you're making unnecessary connections.
Do you know Saad?
I had my exam today.
I couldn't write anything.
What could I write?
I lost answers to all questions.
I didn't have anything to say or write.
What could I write, when..
I didn't remember anything?
Zaini, whats wrong with you?
What are you doing to yourself?
This is the only thing I can control.
You've gone crazy. What are you thinking?
What do you think? What am I thinking?
If you're making an issue out of my friendship with Zara..
Issue..
this is the issue..
Zaini, listen..
Zara is only my friend. Nothing else.
And Zara doesn't know anything about it. Please don't tell her anything.
Why don't you understand me?
Saad, will you now shout at me?
You're fed up of me?
Alright. I'm sorry.
But stop thinking that.
You're still worried about Zara.
How can I make you believe my love for you?
Saad, where you have to make someone believe your love..
Love no longer exists there.
The relationship is enforced, not lived.
Love isn't a thing that you can tell someone.
Saad if you love me, then why can't I feel it?
Even when you're associated to me.. why do I feel myself incomplete?
Tell me Saad.. do you have an answer?
Saad, say something. I'm talking to you.
I need an answer..
Saad..
Bye..
Saad, where you have to make someone believe your love.. love doesn't exist there.
The relationship is enforced, not lived.
Love isn't a thing that you have to tell someone about it.
Saad, if you love me, why can't I feel it?
Even when I'm associated to you.. why do I feel incomplete?
Sometimes we have to leave friends behind to save our relationships.
Zara?
Yes mom?
Zara, can you do me a favor? Are you busy?
No. Not at all. Did you need something done?
Your father told me to get the books out from the store with the maid.
He needed to give a few old books to the kids.
I didn't remember it earlier.
Can you help me get out the books from the store?
All of them. Take the keys. The store is locked.
Yes.
What are you doing here?
I asked you a question but you didn't answer me.
What answer?
I asked you if you'd be friends with me.
You didn't answer me and ran away. Now I'm asking you. Tell me.
Will you be my friend?
Have you lost your mind? Aren't you ashamed of such cheap thoughts?
What is there to be ashamed about?
You're friends with Saad. You're so frank with him. What will happen if you become my friend? Be my friend.
People like you don't understand the meaning of friendship
That's why I'm telling you..
Move back..
You make me understand the meaning of friendship.
Move back. Leave.. If you don't leave, I'll call everyone. Go away.
If you call everyone, I'll be scared. For God's sake, don't call anyone.
Whats the harm in becoming my friend?
See Saad is your friend and you're so frank with him.
You laugh with him and hold his hand. Be my friend as well...
I'm warning you. I'm warning you. Don't take a step further.
I'll not spare you.
I'll avenge this slap.
What happened?
Saad.. actually..
What happened? Why are you so angry?
Why do you look so disheveled? Did you have a fight?
No. You go from here and I didn't fight with anyone.
Don't eat my brain. Leave me.
Tell me, who did you fight with?
I didn't fight with anyone. Leave me alone. Spare me.
If you have a headache, should I make you some tea and give you a painkiller?
Give me poison. I'll be rid of you. I'm asking you to leave me alone. Go away.
Why are you so angry? I'm leaving!
Zara? Tell me. What happened? Why are you crying?
I'm asking something.
Zara, I'm worried.
Saad, leave. I cannot talk right now.
But Zara..
Please leave from here, right now.
Hello aunty..
Saad, when did you come?
I just came a little while ago.
I wanted to meet Zara but I think she's in the washroom so I couldn't meet her.
Alright. You can meet Zara later. Come sit with me for a while.
Of course.
Will you have tea? Should I make it?
No. I had it at home.
You seem worried. Is everything alright?
No. I'm not worried. But..
Do you want to say something?
I want to say something to you
but I don't know how..
I think I've always taken you as my mother.
You can tell me whatever is in your heart, without any hesitation.
Dear, you're watching how we've been through a mess lately.
Zara's life is in front of you.
I have three daughters and if any one of them is in pain, I get hurt, dear.
I just want to take precautions and move ahead in my life.
I'm afraid now.
I don't understand. What are you trying to say?
Dear, your friendship with Zara is very old
and I've never objected on your friendship. But,
when people outside start talking, things come to the house as well.
I wanted to say that.. dear you please come here a little less.
Mirha?
What has she done to her room?
Saad.. dear, don't mind what I said. I don't doubt your intentions dear.
But I don't want anyone to point a finger at my daughters.
For me, Zara, Zaini..
both of them are equal.
And you're more than Ali for me, Saad.
Do you understand me?
Yes aunty..
Do you talk to Zaini?
Yes aunty.. Sometimes.
She's often busy studying and I'm at my job but we do talk a little.
I'll send her to you.
Give her time, dear.
She needs your attention and time, more.
All of us are there for Zara.
I'll try.
I'll send her.
Sure.
Oh.. did you see? She is such a strict woman. She's hurting her daughter in law.
Mirha, what is this?
Where did you get this from?
This isn't the answer to my question. Answer me what I asked you.
Whats wrong Mahi? Why are you arguing with your sister?
Wait a minute, mom. Let me talk to her.
Tell me what do you want to talk about?
Who allowed you to fill this form?
Whats the issue in this?
There is an issue. There is a big issue.
You will not step out of this house to do as you please.
You better not cross your limits.
Can someone tell me what are you arguing about?
She filled the university form without our permission. She's getting an admission.
What?
And even if I have filled the admission form, what is your problem?
Oh Mirha.. how could you take such a big decision yourself?
This is what I'm saying. Who allowed her to do this?
She will not go to the university. She will not leave this house
Why? Why shouldn't I study further?
I want to build a career for myself like my friends.
Really? Have you grown up so much that you'll decide for your life, yourself?
At least, I'll not let you decide for my life.
Listen to her.. Her tongue wags like the scissor.
What is wrong with you Mirha? Why do you want to study further?
And why do you need to study further? You'll end up in the kitchen as it is.
Mom, I don't want to end up in the kitchen like you.
I want to study, mom..
Enough. I'll not hear another word, Mirha.
I did bring an educated daughter in law in this house.
What did she do? Didn't you see?
Should I blacken my face sending you to the university?
Nobody is going anywhere. Listen to me.
Take care of the house. Take care of the kitchen from tomorrow.
In fact, not from tomorrow. From today. Mahi..
She'll be making flat breads at night.
Did you hear? You'll make the flat breads.
Mahi...
She has lost her mind. She spoilt my entire drama.
I want to talk to you.
Your silence has already said everything. 
What more do you need to say?
Your words have lost all meaning.
Zaini, its important that we talk.
Hows that? 
Mom told you to talk to me?
Then you should have told her no? 
Or couldn't you say no?
Zaini, why are you talking to me like this?
Saad, the person you're here to meet.. she's in her room. Go and meet her.
Zaini, I'm here to meet you.
If only.. this truth was evident in your eyes as well.
Zaini, whats happening to you?
 Why are you doing this?
Aren't you tired of asking the same question again and again?
Why did aunty tell me to come here less often or meet Zara less or to give you more time?
Oh.. so..
you didn't like this.
I don't understand you Zaini. First you told Zara and then your mom. Why?
I didn't tell anyone, anything.
Don't lie. If you didn't say anything, why did aunty talk to me?
I don't know. You should go and ask her.
Zaini, what are you trying to prove, doing all this?
Am I trying to prove something? Or do you prove that you don't value me at all, coming here everyday?
Do you even realize that?
Zaini, you're over exaggerating.
Am I over exaggerating? Then you tell me, how should I react? 
Maybe you could tell me whatever is going on in my brain, its true or false?!
Zaini, the truth is what you don't want to listen to. 
This is stuck in your mind and you keep arguing to me about it?
Am I arguing with you?
The way you mind me questioning you or mom's concern.. 
I do feel bad in exactly the same way.
When you come here for Zara and not for me.
Zaini, Zara is my friend and I'll not here a word against her.
 You can think whatever you want.
I'm tired of giving you explanations. 
Zara was my friend, she is and she always will be.
Nobody can stop me from taking care of her or meeting her. Not even you. 
My intentions are pure.
And next time, I'll not argue with you about it.
I had never thought Adeel that you and I will be together for such a short time
 and that we'll part ways so soon.
After you left, I didn't realize, I'd be so unsafe, Adeel.
I want to come to you. 
Please call me to you.
 I cannot tolerate all this.
Hello?
Hello. Are you back?
I just did.
What did you bring?
This is for you?
Such a heavy dress?
Wear it on the engagement, you'll look good.
You know I don't wear such clothes. It won't suit me and everybody will laugh at me.
Its good.
It is good. How much did it cost?
8000.
Only 8000? 
Did you even think about your wife once before you bought such a cheap dress?
Do you know, when we have events in our house, dad at least gets us dresses worth twenty five, thirty thousand. 
And its your sister's engagement and I'm her only sister in law.
You didn't even think once before buying this dress.
See, I don't have bungalows and properties like your father.
I could only buy this in my salary and this inflation. 
If you don't like it, I'll get it returned.
No. I'll wear it since you brought it for me.
Will I get tea?
I'll get it.
What happened brother? Why are you so quiet?
Nothing. I was just listening to the news.
It doesn't seem so. It seems your thinking something else.
Its nothing. Its just work related tension these days.
Brother, don't take so much stress.
I do try not to take stress. But now you tell me, how is Ali? 
Is everything alright between you two?
Everything is alright but he's very busy these days.
How is his office coming along?
There are a lot of problems with his job these days.
What sort of problems?
I don't know. He said there had been a change in management in his office and some other issues. 
He's caught up with those.
Alright.
Zara wants to work?
Yes, she was thinking about it but I don't know.
Didn't you talk to her?
Yes I did. But let it be. She'll work when she wants to.
Is everything alright between you and Zaini?
Yes. Why?
No. I was just asking. Do you want tea?
Yes. Get me a cup, please.
What are you doing? Come mom is calling you.
I'm not coming.
Have you forgotten mom asked you to make flat breads at night? You have a duty.
I will not touch any chore.
So what will you do? I tore your forms.
So what? I'll buy a new form. In fact I'll fill an online form.
So you'll not listen to us?
No. And not yours at all.
Wow.. even the ant has learnt to fly.
Do you know what I can do?
And do you know what I can do? After all I am your sister.
You've done enough blackmailing. 
Your blackmailing will not work any more.
 If you stand in my way, I'll stand in yours.
What will you do? Tell me.
I'll tell everyone.
That you were the one who called Aquib that night. Not Zara.
Enough Mirha.
Its enough. If you try and come in my way, I'll not spare you.
