Zara? Wait here. Why are you here?
I have to talk to uncle.
Really? So that the limited breathes he have to live, you stop them too?
Why would I want that, aunt?
You're the only cause of his condition right now.
I'll not let you talk to him. Understand?
Please let me talk to him. I'll clear whatever misunderstandings he has.
You'll now say whatever you want to say in front of your parents.
Aunt, you'll not say anything to mom and dad.
Why won't I?
They should also know what their daughter is doing in this house.
Aunt, my parents will die. Don't be so harsh.
Really? And whatever you've done with us, what about that?
You took away my son from me.
You destroyed Mahi's life and now you're after my husband's life.
I'll not even let your shadow fall on my family now.
Please listen to me once.
Enough. Whatever lies and truths you have to tell, let your parents come.
You can tell them all. Understand?
Why are you here? Leave from here.
Don't be loud. Dad isn't well.
I'll not quiet down. Why did you do this?
What did you get from all this?
Shut up with your nonsense.
I will not.
You can fool mom and dad but not me.
I know the truth.
In fact, I'll go to mom and dad and tell them. Its all your planning. You're a liar.
Go.
What will you tell them? That boy came to meet you and not Zara.
And he didn't even come for the first time.
He has already come a lot of times. Go and tell them.
Why are you doing this? I love him.
Its all nonsense. He lies. He doesn't love you.
You're the one, whose lying.
Am I lying? I?
Alright then..
Then hear it yourself.
I'll leave Mirha. Please delete this.
You'll have to do something for me.
This isn't so easy.
Alright. Then I'll show this video to the police.
So you're blackmailing me.
No. I'm helping you escape prison.
And what if I don't do any such thing?
You have no other option.
Alright. If I help you,
will you delete this video?
Of course I'll delete this video.
And I'll also pay you for your work. But for that, you'll have to tell me the truth.
Do you really love Mirha or were you fooling her for her money?
What are you saying?
Did I say something wrong?
Tell me the truth. Aren't you fooling Mirha? You don't love her.
You're just eyeing her money.
Actually...
Don't lie. I just want the truth from you today.
Why did you trap Mirha with your love?
You'll only tell me the truth today or else I'll call the police.
No. Please don't do that.
I'll tell you the truth.
I don't love Mirha.
My friendship was only for her money.
I was in a big debt and I wanted to repay it through Mirha.
I don't have anyone in my family.
And when I saw Mirha in the college for the first time, I had decided,
I'd reach out to her.
This is the truth.
Did you hear it? Now do you believe me?
I wanted to show you something else as well. Here.
Didn't I tell you?
He isn't a good man.
That day, Aquib was involved with the robbers.
He isn't a good guy.
Why did he do this to me, Mahi?
Mirha..
some people don't deserve love. They just deserve to be hated.
Why is this happening with me? Why am I trapped in a whirlpool of problems?
God please show me a way out. I want to come out of this horrible nightmare.
Please help me.
How can I prove my innocence?
You know the truth. Please help me.
When mom and dad finds out, they'll not be able to bear it.
Thank you so much.
Its good to meet you. We'll meet again.
Alright. Bye.
Yes, where is Saad.
I don't know.
I know. He left.
To Zara.
How can you be so sure?
I am so sure because he was talking on the phone and said he'd come right away. He must have gone to Zara.
See, this is such an important event. His sister is getting married.
He'll only go to Zara leaving all this. He doesn't value you. Isn't it?
I'm here to give you company. See, this is such good weather and such a good event.
So many guests with beautiful faces.
Saad, when did you come?
When you were talking to Zaini.
Zaini, what did he say?
I'll tell you what I was saying. You weren't here. She was getting bored so I came to give her company.
Now you're here. Talk. Give her company.
Alright, Zaini I'll leave. Okay Saad.
Enjoy..
Stay away from him.
and where did you go?
A friend of mine called. His car broke down. I went to drop his family.
Alright.
Alright, lets go inside now.
Yes? How are you Maheen?
Why did you call?
To tell you that we're not tolerating your sister in our house anymore.
Get her things and take her back.
What nonsense is this? Are you out of your mind?
I am right in my mind and my intention is rock solid.
What are you saying?
Oh, I thought you were the only one in your house but your sister is way ahead of you.
Mahi, don't make me guess stupid riddles.
Tell me clearly, what happened to Zara?
If you worry about her so much, why did you leave her here?
We didn't leave her there, understand? You people stopped her.
Alright. So now we're throwing her out. Come and take her back.
Mahi, are you in your senses? If you even put a scratch on Zara, I'll tear your face apart.
Oh my God. Such anger?!
Come and take your sister. She has blackened her face here.
How dare you say such a thing about Zara, Mahi?
Mahi!
Zaini.. Zara..
Who told you?
I'm telling you. Mahi called. She said to come and take Zara away.
Oh God. What are they doing with my daughter?
I've been calling since morning. Nobody was answering.
Get a grip on yourself.
Please take me to my daughter. If my sister in law throws my daughter out, where will she go?
what will she do? What is she doing, Manzoor?
Are you telling the truth, did Mahi tell you this?
Why would I lie to you dad? Mahi called. She said all this.
She's right. I'm telling you. I was upset since morning.
I felt something bad was happening with Zara.
Aunty, don't worry. We'll just go and visit Zara.
Take me along. Take me instantly, dear.
Mom, don't worry. We'll leave immediately. Dad, I'll get the car.
Come.
Alright. Go fast.
You people stay at home.
Should I come with you?
Please pray. I'll go there and call you.
I'll go with them.
I'll go.
Mahi was very angry. I am scared. What if they did something bad to Zara?
Did you see?Your brother again threw me out like a fly from milk.
What would you have done there?
Alright. So what will Saad do there?
Saad is a different case. He is their to-be son in law.
Alright. Saad is their son in law.
And what am I?
what?
I am his brother in law. I have a right to go.
Let it be. What are you discussing?
I'm worried thinking what happened there
that Mahi called Maheen and insulted her so much.
You shouldn't worry about anything at all. You'll see Saad will be the backbone of everything.
What?
Yes. Zara has nobody other than Saad. You'll see the two of them will be caught.
Why do you speak such nonsense?
Saad is a very respectable boy.
Of course. Saad is respectable and I?
Your husband is the cheapest thug on Earth, isn't it?
I didn't want to get involved in Dolly's ceremony.
I was forced.
What do you mean? Do you still doubt me?
No.
Listen to me. Throw away the trash in your mind.
You'll get sick some day. You keep thinking stupid things.
Dolly is the daughter in law of this house.
Clean your mind.
You're making me sick! Turn off the lights. I'm sleepy.
Turn off the lights.
I have a few things to do. I'll finish them and then turn off the lights. You go to sleep.
Go and turn off the lights.
I'll do that.
Saad, how long before we reach, dear?
Aunty, we're almost there.
What have you done to my daughter?
The innocent daughter, you're sympathizing with, Sarwat.
If you find out what she did, you'll strangle her yourself.
What is she saying?
What did she do? My daughter isn't like that. You must be mistaken.
I'm not mistaken.
We caught her ourselves with that boy in her room. Red handed.
Enough. Don't accuse my daughter of something so big.
This is the truth, brother Manzoor.
We thought you people were very respectable
but you've given a free hand to your daughters.
They can have an affair with anyone and whenever they want to. There's no problem.
Enough aunty!
You're speaking way too much.
Come on now. There's another supporter of Zara. Did you see?
You're not way behind anybody else.
I have complete faith, you too would have had an affair with Zara in the past.
Enough! What are you saying?!
Enough Fareeda. What are you saying?
You will not interfere at all, Mr. Ahmed.
Whatever is happening, is because of you.
You were insistent on making this girl as the daughter in law of our house.
Now did you see the consequences of this.
She has gotten us insulted. She has left us unable to show our face to anyone.
Enough Fareeda.
You're accusing my daughter. Do you have any proof?
Proof?
My eyes are the witness.
We saw her with that boy in the room, with our own eyes.
And she has saved that boy's number in her phone as Saad.
Do you need another proof?
Enough Fareeda. Enough!
Don't accuse my daughter of something so big.
I cannot accept it. I cannot.
Then don't. Don't accept it.
But now we'll not keep this trash in our house anymore.
Do us a favor and take her away forever, from here.
Mom, I cannot even think about it. How can I even do that?
Dad I cannot do that. You can ask me to swear upon anything.
I don't even know him. I don't know how he came in my room.
Zara, we trust you.
Come on now. Do you people see?
How he is pining like her lover? He has no shame or care.
We had heard that even a witch attacks leaving seven houses
but she has destroyed her own sister's house.
Aunt Please!
You cannot point a finger at Zara's character like this?
How are you talking to my mother?
Don't you see how your mother is accusing Zara?
So? She's right.
Your sister ruined our reputation. She deserves this.
Stop it. Its enough.
Why don't you make them quiet, Ahmed?
She's saying whatever she wants to say.
Sarwat..
it would be better if you take your daughter along.
Come on dear. We'll leave from here.
Ali, get your sister's things.
You're taking your daughter. Now take care. Keep an eye on her.
In fact I'll advise you to get her married for the second time, as soon as possible.
The gift that you've given us, Fareeda.
After this, we don't need any of your advises.
All of you have destroyed my daughter together.
I'll not forgive you. Not at all.
You told me Ahmed, that you'll keep my Zara as your daughter.
You'll not let even a scratch come to her.
This is how you took care of her.
You made my daughter a culprit in front of everyone.
You couldn't make your wife quiet. She kept on saying whatever she wanted to say.
Stay in your limits, Sarwat.
I'm elder than you.
If you're elder, prove it.
You shouldn't have called us here to insult us.
And you wouldn't have created a spectacle of your daughter in law's respect.
She isn't my daughter in law.
My son is dead and with him, this relationship of a mother and daughter in law is also dead.
Now do us a favor, take this present forever from our house.
Come on.
In fact, we don't have any relation with you people.
Whatever you've done with my daughter, remember it. You'll have to account for it.
You'll regret it. All of you will regret it and it will be very late then.
Come on Sarwat.
Wait a minute Zara.
You cannot leave from here, like this.
God knows what will be happening there.
I don't know.
What did Mahi tell you?
All nonsense.
But how can she accuse her of something so serious?
What are you trying to say? Did Zara do something wrong?
No. Maheen, I don't mean to say that.
I mean. How can someone accuse Zara of something so serious?
Dolly I'll tell you as soon as I find out.
Why are you upset with me?
Alright. Why are you people arguing?
God knows what must be happening with Zara, there. I'm worried about her.
Should I call Ali and ask?
There's no need. They must have reached there, call later.
All of us were so happy.
Someone cast an evil eye on our happiness.
I was telling mom to stay there for a few more days and let Zara come.
But nobody listened to me.
I was already doubtful that something might happen.
What do you mean Maheen?
Are you taunting me? Am I a bad omen?
I didn't say anything about you. I'm sharing my feelings with my sister.
If you feel that this is all because of you, it must be then.
Oh well..
It had to happen and so it did.
Sometimes someone's envy also eats up someone's happiness.
Anyways, I'll make tea. I have to give medicine to mom as well. Will you have some?
No.
Did you see her?
I don't know. I'm worried about Zara right now.
Whats wrong Mahi?
Why are you stopping her? Let her go.
Just one last thing.
I want Zara to remove all marks before she leaves this house.
Be clear, what do you want to say?
She'll return everything Adeel gave her. Its our right, not hers.
What things?
I have nothing with me except Adeel's memories, Mahi.
You do, have Zara.
The house Adeel named to you.
Give me the papers of that house and go wherever you want to go.
House?
Adeel gave that house to Zara. How can you take that?
Why can't I take it, dad?
It is my brother's memoir.
I will not let her have it at any cost.
It was my brother's house. We have a right to it. Not you.
It is good that we saw her real face. Who knows,
she would have squandered my brother and father's hard earned money on boys like him.
Hold your tongue, Mahi.
Aren't you ashamed to use such words for my daughter?
Why are you shouting at Mahi?
Ask your daughter. She created all this mess.
God forbid, you've made my house a battle ground.
You're standing in my house and shouting at my daughter.
And whatever you're doing with my daughter... Is that right?
We will treat people however they deserve to be treated.
Zara, what is Mahi saying?
Give her the file back. Where is it?
Mom, take your medicine.
Yes, give it to me.
What happened to you?
Nothing.
Zaini and Maheen left all alone and you didn't stop them?
What would they have done by staying here? Its good that they left.
Why are you saying this?
Mom.. Maheen is so ill mannered. She thinks I'm a kid that I won't say anything.
She was indirectly calling me ill fortune.
Maheen?
Yes!
But why? Why did she say that?
After whatever happened with Zara on my wedding..
She said if the wedding had been finalized according to her, nothing would have happened.
 Is this they way?
See, dear..
Nobody is a bad omen for anyone.
 This is all our perception and they've rusted in our mind. 
The best way is to clear your heart of this rust.
 Don't let these thoughts come in your mind.
Dear, Maheen is a child. She insensible. She doesn't know what to say or do.
Mom, why is she like this?
She hurts me so much with her words.
Leave everything. Tell me, did you talk to Saad? What did he say?
I haven't talked to him, mom. I've been calling, he isn't answering.
Alright. Now don't call him back. He'll be worried.
God knows how Zara must be? 
What situation she might be in...
Alright.. I'll go and offer prayers. I'll pray for everyone.
There's nothing inside this, Mahi.
Where is the file?!
Oh God.. you're the most merciful. 
All praise is for you. You know the secrets of all our hearts.
You know our intentions. 
God, take care of my children. 
Our Zara is in a problem right now.
Keep her safe from all those shrewd people. 
Take care of her, my Lord. 
Whatever is best for her, do the same for her, God. 
Have mercy on that child, oh Lord.
Have mercy my Lord. Amen.
I didn't know they will be such cheap people.
 Dear, if you have anything else, give it back to them.
I don't need any of their things or their charity. 
We have everything God has blessed us with.
Oh really?
Now all of this is charity for you. 
You had no objections to anything when Adeel was alive.
All of you wanted Adeel to settle down in Karachi. 
You wanted him to live away from his parents, his family and fulfill your wishes.
We had never wanted anything. Adeel wanted it.
He wanted to leave this house because of you.
 He knew your habits. He knew you'd never accept Zara as your daughter in law. 
And now see..
The same thing has happened. As soon as he died, all of you showed your true colors.
Now enough. You don't have to talk much.
 Mahi, did you check? Are all the papers complete?
Yes. All papers are there.
hmm... 
You don't have to create any dramas.
Aunty... aunty.. No..
Keep this. Do all the remaining dramas at your house.
Come on dear. Take these and leave.
I'll never forgive you. I'll never forgive you, brother. 
Think of your sister as dead, from today.
And you're dead to me.
Come on now. Get out of here.
The lesser the trash, the better.
