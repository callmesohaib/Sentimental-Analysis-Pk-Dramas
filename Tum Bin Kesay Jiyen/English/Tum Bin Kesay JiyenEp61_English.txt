It's been a week mom.
Zenny didn't talk to me.
She is very uncomfortable because of my stay here.
I don't like it mom.
I will go back.
Mom Zara want me to give her divorce.
What?
Your happiness matters to me. I only want to see you happy.
For God sake, stop your drama.
And I don't want love in charity.
Come in.
Sir, miss Zenny has arrived, her interview is lined up for today.
Send her.
OK sir.
Sir, may I come in?
Yes
Sir, you called me.
Yes.
It's 3:40.
Are are aware about lunch hours?
Yes sir.
Where have you been?
Do you know that I was waiting for you for the last 30 minutes.
Sir, I am so sorry. Actually, I went out for some important work.
With whom?
What do you mean sir?
I mean, is everything fine by your side?
You would have gone for some important work.
Yes sir.
That was a very important work.
I will give you all updates after ten minutes.
Sure
Thank you.
If you want me to forgive you.
Then you will have to do whatever I will ask you to do
You will have to tell the truth to everyone.
Whatever you did to my sister-in-law, now you will tell everyone that it was not her fault.
And you have done that on Mahi's instructions.
Doctor tell me about my reports.
Yes Maheen, I have got your reports but
I have no good news for you.
What do you mean? I didn't get your point.
There are so many complications in your case.
Which complications?
Tell us openly about her problem doctor.
I have studied her case in detail.
I was in doubt but my doubt got cleared from her reports.
She can never become a mother.
What
Mom
Mom, what is she saying?
You are lying to us, right?
I will file a case against you.
How can you make this false report about me.
Maheen relax.
Maheen, control yourself. What's wrong with you.
Mom didn't you hear what she is saying.
I am normal and my family is normal and if Zara and Dolly can become a mother then why can't I become a mother? This is lie.
Maheen, their cases are different than your case.
Just shut up.
You are lying. I don't believe you at all.
You can check these reports from some other doctor and you can conduct your tests from some other lab.
Please don't take stress. It's not good for you. Don't think negatively.
This was the reason earlier as well for all of this.
Mom, didn't she get any doubt.
No I don't think so.
If that was the case then she should have said something.
Mom pray that we may succeed in our objective for which we have sent here there.
If God wills.
May Saad and Zara understand each others' sentiments.
Whatever we have done to bring both of them close to each other
May we get succeed in our efforts. Ameen.
Mom, I am feeling really bad.
I said so much to Zara.
No problem my child.
Sometime we have to do something we don't like by doing something.
But whatever you have done was for both of them betterment.
Mom I want brother and Zara to live happily together.
And I am sure that brother also wants this.
I have seen love for Zara in brother's eyes.
I pray to God that Zara may realize Saad's love.
Ameen
Mom why have you brought this?
You are back. I was waiting for you since long.
Why?
And what are you doing here?
I thought you will need some support so I was waiting for you.
What do you mean?
What do you want to say?
It means that you don't know anything about this.
About what?
Zara has gone back to her house.
Yes
What happened? Hey.
It will be fun now. Zara vs Zenny once again.
Why did Zara do this to me?
Why do you do this to me Zara?
Why did you do this to me?
Why?
Why Zara
What do you get by doing all of this?
Mahi. Mahi
Mahi.
What's the matter? Why are you shouting?
Where is Mahi? Call her.
What's the matter?
What's the matter dad? Why are you shouting like this?
What is this? Why have you done this?
Have you rewarded us for our trust and love?
Forgive me. I made this mistake. Forgive me.
Look at this, what has she done.
Dad, I made this mistake, please forgive me.
Mahi
Mahi
What is this?
I won't do this again. Please forgive me.
We can't face anyone because of you Mahi.
Please listen to me.
It's only because of your leniency.
Neither you had given her that leverage nor she would have gone out of this house by defaming me.
Mom, dad, please forgive me.
How many times I will have to forgive you.
I have been forgiving you being my eldest daughter.
But you defamed me.
No dad, I didn't do any such thing. Please listen to me once.
How did you...
I mean that how did you come?
I have come back because of aunt.
Thank God that you came back because of her.
What?
No.
If you wouldn't have come then I would have taken care of mom.
OK Saad, I will go back tomorrow.
No, I didn't mean to say that.
You can stay here as long as you want.
Do I serve dinner for you
Have you eaten?
Can we eat together?
Let me serve dinner.
Mom, please ask dad to forgive me. I won't do anything like this again.
Mahi what have you done to us?
I made a very big mistake. Please ask dad to forgive me.
I didn't expect this from you Mahi. I didn't expect this from you.
Who has come Mirha?
Mom
You
What are you doing here? What do you want from us?
I want to tell you something.
I am Mirha's friend Aqib.
Mirha doesn't know anything about it. She has nothing to do with that.
Whatever happened that night was just a lie.
I have no relation with your daughter-in-law. I didn't know her.
What nonsense. You are lying.
My daughters don't lie. You are lying.
Aunt I am telling you the truth.
And whatever your daughter-in-law was saying that night was also true.
She knew that she is being trapped intentionally.
But even then she didn't say anything.
Rather she kept the honor of this house and dignity of your daughters safe.
Both of us didn't know each other.
I did that out of a compulsion.
I made a very big mistake uncle please forgive me.
You cheap man, I will kill you.
I will kill you.
Such a big deception.
Such a big deception.
Uncle forgive me
Shameless person.
Didn't you feel ashamed.
Why did you do this to us? What did we do wrong to you?
You guys forgive me.
I am in love with Mirha.
I have made this very big mistake.
I shouldn't have betrayed Mirha.
And nor I should have done all that to your daughter-in-law.
Then why did you do that?
Actually
I was compelled.
Who forced you?
What was your compulsion?
I was forced
Who incited you to do that?
Get out of our house.
Mahi asked me to do that.
What? He is lying.
Dad believe me.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
He is a liar.
How can you do that Mahi?
What have you done?
Here is your tea.
Thank you.
Did you talk to Zara?
Yes, I called her.
Did she tell any reason for going suddenly?
Yes.
I asked her about that so she told me that aunt's health got deteriorated so I am going because Dolly can't go.
I thank God that she went there anyway
But now I am observing that ever since she has gone back
Zenny's mood is off.
Ever since she has returned from office she didn't eat anything and locked herself in room.
You should advise her.
What do I do? She composed herself.
But she is again got disturbed because of Zara's arrival.
I want Zara to go back to her house. I also talked to her in the morning.
But she is still stuck on her point that she won't live with Saad.
And she says that this time she will make decision by herself.
Did you talk to Saad?
No, I got busy in some work so I couldn't call him.
I am also worried Sarwat.
Because three lives are connected with this matter.
And I think if two persons get agreed on same point in any matter then third person should compromise.
Yes, but it's very difficult to spend life with compromises.
But if there is no way out then we should accept compromises as decision of nature.
It makes life easy.
You went to doctor with Maheen. What did she say?
Yes I went with her. Doctor said that everything is alright.
Thank God, we got some relief from one side.
Ask Maheen to leave everything to God.
God willing, everything will be alright.
Yes, I asked her to do the same.
Get out.
Mahi gave me money to do that.
No dad, he is lying.
Dad believe me, I didn't do anything like that. He is a liar.
I am not lying. You know that I don't lie. I didn't do anything.
Mahi how could you do all of that
And you get lost from here before I will kill you.
Get lost.
Oh my God, what have I done.
Believe me dad I didn't do anything.
How could you do that.
Why did you do that Mahi?
What did she do wrong to you?
I did so much for you Mahi.
I always fulfilled your wishes by going against your father's consent.
But you did this to me.
And you accused Zara with such a big blame.
You snatched all my dignity from me.
But you didn't feel content and you accused Zara with such a big blame
Why? Why did you do that?
Didn't you feel ashamed a bit.
Didn't you feel ashamed? Why didn't you die?
Why didn't you die before doing all of that.
Why did you do that?
Mom, please forgive me.
Don't touch me. I am not your mother.
You didn't do good to all of us.
You did great injustice to all of us.
You did great injustice to me, to Zara and to all of us.
Mom, please forgive me, I made that mistake. Please.
I couldn't even think that you can do that Mahi.
You didn't even leave your sister.
You ruined Zara's life but you also ruined your own sister's life.
You also effected her in your hatred.
Ahmed. Ahmed.
Dad. Dad.
Dad get up.
Mirha bring water.
Dad please forgive me. I won't do that again.
Ahmed. Ahmed.
Dad, drink water.
Dad please forgive me. I won't do that again.
Call doctor.
Ahmed. Ahmed.
What happened to brother Ahmed? How is he feeling now?
Your brother got effected by Zara's bad condition.
He is not right.
Mahi, if anything happened to your dad then I will never forgive you.
Why are you saying this mom, nothing will happen to dad.
You have ruined everything.
What else is left.
He is in this condition because of you.
He is fighting for his life.
He couldn't bear the trauma given by you.
What have you done Mahi? What did you earn by doing that?
Mom.
Get lost. I don't want to see your face.
Mom please don't say that.
I have no one except you. Where will I go?
You have taken revenge of this thing from us.
I never scolded you on any of your mistake. I never forbade you from doing bad things.
That's why you did all of that.
Mahi you didn't even think about your own sister.
You ruined her life.
I couldn't understand that he is the same bad boy.
Zara didn't say a single word about both of you and about that boy. She only kept giving clarification about herself.
He was the same boy. Am I right?
Mirha
You didn't tell me about him either.
Mom, I was about to tell you but.
I understood.
What did you do Mahi?
Mirha take her away from my sight.
Take her away from my sight.
At least you should have cared about anyone.
Adeel will ask me, how will I respond?
Why didn't you die Mahi.
Mirha take her away from my sight.
I don't want to see her face. When I see her face then Zara's face comes in my eyes.
What did you do Mahi?
For what you took revenge?
Go away from my sight. I don't want to see your face.
Mom please.
Take her away.
I don't want to see your face.
Go away from my sight.
Mom
What's the matter? Are you alright?
Yes, I am fine. I was just feeling suffocated so I went out.
Mom are you alright?
Is there anything to worry about?
I am perfectly alright.
I don't know why I did feel suffocation suddenly?
Let me take you to doctor. Everything will be alright.
Hey no.
I am telling you that I was just feeling suffocation.
I will feel better if I will lay down for a while.
Take rest. I will take you to doctor if needed.
OK, I will tell you.
OK
Doctor
How is my husband feeling now?
We are here since last night but you are not giving us any update on his condition.
We are trying our best to stabilize his condition.
He has got a major heart attack.
We will have to operate him immediately.
So why aren't you doing operation. Do that immediately.
Our surgeon is out of city, we will start operating him as soon as he arrives.
You can get remaining information from reception.
O God, why are we facing this problem for no reason.
Please sit down. I will be back right away. Sit here.
My heart is pounding Mahi.
I will be right back. Please sit.
My child.
You have returned to Pakistan after a long time.
Yes after two years.
I came back last time and went back after we got married.
Now I have come back again and my friends informed me that Zara and Saad got married so I couldn't stop myself.
And I have come along with her immediately.
Mom it's his old habit. He can't wait.
Well Fiza is also very bothered from this habit of mine.
I am used to it now.
It's nice to feel each others absence. This makes our relations stronger.
I am glad to see your happy couple. May God keep your relation in tact.
Ameen. Thanks aunt.
Sister
You should say something as well. You are sitting quietly.
I am fine. Please have some. You haven't taken anything.
By the way brother Saad you are so lucky.
You have got such a beautiful wife.
And I have heard that you got top position in whole university.
Let me tell you about that.
We worked really hard throughout the year
But she only used to study during last week and became topper.
Am I right Saad.
Yes you are absolutely right.
By the way Zara, why don't you find a job for yourself.
She has a very good GPA aunt.
And you will get job in any firm very easily. Am I right?
Yes my child.
I have no objection.
It's upto Zara.
Fantastic.
You have got aunt's support as well.
You must think about it.
By the way, let me tell you aunt
Both of them used to fight so much in university that our whole time passed in resolving their quarrels.
Well they are same till now.
Really? But why?
Your quarrels should have finished by now.
Well I want this to happen but your friend doesn't agree with me.
Stop it Saad.
There is love hidden behind this anger.
Yes you are right.
By the way, I am glad to see both of you together.
It is said that you are made for each so it's like that.
Let me bring water.
Have some my child. You haven't taken anything.
Sure, I will take it.
Are you with patient Ahmed?
Yes.
Who is Zara among you?
Zara?
Yes.
Is my husband alright? How is he now?
Patient is continuously taking Zara's name. If Zara is not here then please call her and ask her to come here. Thank you.
OK.
Call her.
The most precious thing in life is life itself my child.
Life doesn't stop nor it ends if we lose / break in love, marriage, or losing any relation or any thing else.
The decision you are going to make is not right.
I don't know that why are you doing this.
But being a mother, I can understand emotions of my children.
No matter if you don't want to tell me anything
But I know
You also start to like Saad.
Yes my child, I know about it.
You didn't commit any sin.
And I also know that why are you afraid of moving forward towards Saad?
Adeel was your past my child.
And Saad is your present.
And Nikah is so powerful that it gives life to even two strangers' life less relation.
This is the power of Nikah
Which has raised emotions in hearts of both of you.
You can't give away a sacred relationship like marriage.
Rather you take care of that and keep that in tact.
So that a third person can't make room for himself in that relation.
And this is your place my child. Only yours.
And no one can snatch this from you.
You will have to hold this relationship very tightly.
Are you getting my point?
Hmm?
Mom, Farida aunt has called on your phone.
Sister Farida's call for me?
What's up sister Farida, is everything alright?
What happened to brother?
When?
How?
Where is he now?
Where?
Yes, we are coming immediately.
What happened?
Brother has got a heart attack.
He is taking Zara's name continuously.
Ali take me there to my brother.
Right mom. Dolly call Saad and ask him to bring Zara here immediately.
Mom, let me call dad, he will also come.
Don't worry.
Dad.
Dad, uncle Ahmed has got heart attack. Please come home quickly. We are leaving for hospital.
He is in hospital since last night.
Don't worry.
Ali ask Zara to come.
OK mom.
Dad please come, we are leaving.
OK.
My brother.
My dear brother.
Nothing will happen.
Stop it mom.
Sister Farida.
Sarwat, your brother..
What happened to brother Ahmed? How is he now?
Your brother got effected because of Zara's bad condition.
His condition is not good.
And do you know that Zara didn't do anything wrong.
That was not her fault. She didn't have any relation with anyone. I misunderstood the whole scenario.
And now your brother's condition is not good.
He continuously taking Zara's name and he is calling her again and again.
Just leave this topic sister.
Tell me what are doctors saying about his condition.
How can I leave?
How can I leave Sarwat?
I have told you the truth today.
But earlier I always used to spread hatred.
But I got effected by that. Your brother condition is not good.
You did cruelty to my brother.
You did great cruelty to my daughter and to all of us.
I am your culprit.
I am your culprit and I am your daughter's culprit as well. Please forgive me.
Please forgive me.
Please pray for my brother's safe recovery.
Please pray for my brother's safe recovery.
So that I could apologize to him.
For God sake, please forgive me.
His condition is not good. Doctors are hopeless.
They asked us to pray for him. Please forgive me.
I have forgiven you sister. I have forgiven you.
May my brother recover safely.
Dear uncle.
Yes.
Dear uncle.
Dear uncle, I am here with you.
Zara
Zara.
I am here with you.
Forgive me.
Please don't say this, I am not angry with you at all.
I am not angry with you. And you will recover soon.
You will recover soon. I am not angry with you.
Please go out. His condition is not good and you can't meet him in this condition. Please go out.
Please mam, go out.
