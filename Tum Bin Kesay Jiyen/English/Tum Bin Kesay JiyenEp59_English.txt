I am unable to understand that how do I compose myself
I am unable to understand anything. 
You are not alone. We are with you.
Are you both sisters mad?
are you both sisters crazy!
Sometime one sister asks me to leave her and other day other sister asks me to leave her.
What do you both want? 
Saad 
It's enough.
the one you are asking about, her name was Jamila. 
Yes Jamila
She has disappeared from here immediately. 
So many people are coming and asking about her. I think she has done some fraud.
what have I done!
Jamila you haven't done good with me, I won't spare you
I will ruin you!
Zaini
dad, you could have called me if you had some work with me
its ok
I came here
you didn't stopped there
actually I was so tired that's why, also I had loads of work in the office today
sometimes, the situation in a person's life make that person go tired
I know
you are upset because of Zara
and you had to do such a big compromise in your life because of me
shall I say something, dear?
the parents are like a very weak & helpless tree
if their roots become a little weaker, then the flowers blooming on them gets withered away
even parents are like that
they gets finished within inside, if any one of their child goes away from them
anyways, I am not such a selfish father that... 
I shall hurt my daughter for my own happiness
I won't force you
in fact, I will ask Zara not to come here again
No dad
please don't say anything to her
please don't stop her for coming here
if she wants to meet you & mom, she can
I have already done compromise with my life
I will try to forget everything
its just that I want some time
I am proud of you, dear
you are also very important to me, like my other children
and until I am alive
never consider yourself alone
here... 
drink your tea
mom, why you've brought it?
where is Zara?
you had dropped her in the morning, have you forgotten?
brother Manzoor wasn't well
didn't she come as of yet?
She has gone there after so many days, she might have stayed there
call & ask her
No mom
why shall I call her, if she didn't call to inform me
and she has gone to her father's house
she will come back whenever she feels like
what's wrong with you, dear?
did you guys had fought on something?
there isn't any such thing, mom
then why are you spoiling your mood so much?
mom, I am just tensed about my office. I am going inside to rest
at least drink your tea
I don't want to
the limit... 
don't know what is happening with this boy!
here comes your piping hot tea
oh dear, you are doing my work since morning. You must be tired by now
its ok dad, I like to do your work
let me do them
Okay
didn't Saad come to pick you?
I will go myself, dad
are you happy with Saad?
I don't know
what do you mean by that?
But you both were... 
dad, you used to say... 
all that glitters is not gold
the same way, its not necessary for every person who looks happy to be happy from within
but both of you were... 
then what was all that?
compromise... 
anyways, leave this topic
you have forgiven me, dad
its enough for me, I don't need anything else
but I was thinking that you & Saad...
leave it dad
please dad, don't say anything
whatever happened with me
there wasn't any fault of yours in it
there wasn't any fault of anyone in it
maybe, there are so many trials in my fate
dad, I must leave now as its getting late
let me ask brother, he might drop me
let me go & ask him
brother... 
won't you talk to me?
please forgive me by considering it as my mistake
even mom & dad have forgiven me
you also forgive me please
this is the elegance of parents
that they forgive all the mistakes of their children & hug them
and Zaini... 
Zaini was helpless, what else she could do?
but I am not helpless
isn't Zara happy with Saad?
if not then what was all that we saw?
were Saad & Zara telling the truth?
wasn't there any such thing between them?
if its true then, what have I done?
Zara's eyes cannot lie
today, I saw the truth in my daughter's eyes
how I couldn't read my daughter's eyes at that time?
oh God... 
what is truth or lie, I don't know
but I want to see my daughters happy
a helpless father can only wish for this
make my daughters life easier, my Lord.. 
make it easier for them
you came back?
I thought, you won't come
who came to drop you?
I came with brother Ali
how is everyone at home?
everyone's complaints would have been lessened by now
when will you go back?
Soon
shall I serve dinner for you?
I am already full
why he doesn't want to eat the dinner? Did he tell you?
he is not hungry
he is sitting furiously since he came back home
he might have some office stress
don't worry, shall I give you some more curry or flat bread?
No dear, you eat. I will take it myself
so tell me, how is brother Manzoor? How is he feeling now?
the doctor is saying its a viral, so it will take a few more days
may God have mercy
dear, you could have stayed there for a few more days. We would have loved it too
but you would have become lonely
what about me, I could have managed
even Saad came back, but anyways its ok
do go to stay there after a few days
Saad
actually I was thinking that... 
switch off the light, I am feeling sleepy
Adnan
Adnan... 
you!
when did you come?
I have never left though
what do you mean by that?
I have killed you with my own hands, then how can you come back?
to take my revenge
you cannot take revenge from me
you cannot harm me at all. I won't let you do anything
Adnan, I will do it
you have killed me
now you have to die as well
you cannot kill me
you cannot kill me!
nobody can save you from me
you have to die
Adnan, you have to die
you have to die
you have to die
you have to die for sure
you have to die
you have to die today...
sister
yes
you haven't slept as of yet?
I wanted to say something to you
I want to say "thanks" to you
because you took my side in front of mom
I had heard you talking to her
you haven't stopped your habit of eavesdropping till date
sister, you can scold me & say whatever you want to. But don't be quiet like this
you don't look good in this way
everyone showing pity on me
why?
for what?
there isn't any such thing, I was just asking you casually that...
has something happened, that you are upset?
No
did you had some issue with brother Fahad?
No
did your friend said something?
No
I am not friends with her anymore
why?
You were right. The friendship among middle class & rich people doesn't lasts for long
So just like that
I have ended it
Okay, I am going to make coffee so tell me would you like to drink some?
I don't feel like drinking it, I want to sleep
go
how do you find the pictures?
if you like them then tell me, I have a few more
shall I send them?
why are you doing this to me? 
What wrong have I done with you?
its your delusion
nobody could harm Fahad till date
See, I beg you. Please delete all of my pictures
yeah, right!
what do you want from me?
Ok lets do one deal
you agree with me
and I will agree with whatever you are saying
what kind of a deal?
give me 5 lac rupees
I will delete your photos
5 lacs!
from where I will bring it? I don't have such a hefty amount
what shall I do then? Bring it from anywhere
if you want me to leave you so easily, then you have to give me such a small amount
Fahad, please don't do this to me
I haven't done anything as of yet
yes, if you won't give me the money then I will think what needs to be done with you
in fact, let me tell you right now
I will send these photos to your respectable father
your marriage had been called off twice before this as well, right?
but you haven't told this to me
Fahad...
just think
what will happen to your father, if he sees these pictures?
he will die..
no Fahad please don't say this. Don't do any such thing
you have only 2 days time
if I didn't get 5 lac rupees within 2 days then...
you know what I can do
Fahad!
Ok do you breakfast, I am leaving
Where are you going?
you came here after so many days
do you remember, we used to be really good friends. We used to meet a lot, now we hardly get any time to meet
I am completely alone here
do come over, whenever you feel like
hello Fahad, please don't hang up. Just listen to me once
Please, I beg you. Don't do this Fahad
hello!
Fahad?
hello!
Mirha...
what's the matter, you are not going to the university nowadays
dad, actually there is a cultural week celebrations at the university that's why I am not going
dear, then you should go there for sure
see, you should know the culture of our country and then...
there are so many colors in our culture
which are tied by a single thread
and they make our country beautiful
and when I was of your age, then I & your aunt...
dear, there is a file in my room namely HMD. Please bring it
Okay
yes! I was telling you that you should go
as it is, you will miss out all of these things once you go abroad
right?
yes dad
Saad
Saad, at least listen to me. 
Why aren't you talking to me?
what's your problem, Saad?
why aren't you understanding my point, Saad? 
Let me try doing it once
Zara, I am getting late
don't talk rubbish to me
Rubbish! Do you find my words rubbish, Saad?
yes, I do
go inside, otherwise mom will hear us
I am not going anywhere, nor you are
I want to talk to you about it, and I won't go anywhere until you answer me
I have already answered you, Zara
Saad, it was a lie
only that was the truth, Zara
why are you doing one foolishness after another, Saad?
until when you'll keep suffering?
I have decided, & you have to agree with me
Since you have decided already, then why are you asking me?
what's the matter? Why are you guys arguing so early morning?
Nothing aunty, we need to bring some groceries
so I was telling Saad to take me to the market
but he doesn't listen to me
Saad, why aren't you listening to her?
she is right
mom, I am getting late as I have to go to office. Bye!
Saad...
Saad!
let it be, don't be angry
I will make him understand..
oh this guy!
Adnan uncle..
Adnan uncle
coming..
mom had sent the breakfast for you
oh, what was the need of it?
 I would have arranged it myself
how come you'll do it, when we are present here
Look, earlier Shaista used to do all of my work & now I have become dependent on you guys
what are you saying, Adnan uncle? You aren't any stranger for us
everyone's love & affection is my only support of living
Ok do you breakfast, I am leaving
where are you going?
you came here after so many days
do you remember, we used to be really good friends. We used to meet a lot, now we hardly get any time to meet
I am completely alone here
do come over, whenever you feel like
we'll sit, talk & lessen our heart's burden
Ok?
Dolly
Ali is calling me, I am leaving
Oh...
this Ali had to call her at this time
well...
if not you then at least lets enjoy the breakfast prepared by you
Dolly
where have you been?
I had been calling you since so long
I had gone to give breakfast to Adnan uncle
Adnan uncle! Why did you go? He could have come by himself
its ok, mom had asked me to. You tell me, why were you calling me, do you have any work for me?
actually I can't find my wallet, can you please help me?/
it must be on its place, let me see
hey Dolly, be careful
what happen, are you ok?
its just that I am feeling dizzy since morning, I am ok
why didn't you tell me? Lets go to the doctor
No no Ali, there is no need to go to the doctor. I will be fine by the evening
Dolly, be quiet & come to the doctor with me. Ok?
Lets go
but Ali..
lets go now, Dolly
I am taking you, so lets go
5 lacs!
from where I will bring 5 lacs? I don't have it
what shall I do?
if you want me to leave you so easily, then you have to give me such a small amount
I will send these photos to your respectable father
your marriage had been called off twice before this as well, right?
just think
what will happen to your father, if he sees these pictures?
what have I done!
why did I trust him?
what will I do now? From where I shall bring the money?
why is this happening with me?
why?
are you asking this, Mahi?
who are you?
I?
I am you!
your inner voice
who are you, and what do you want from me?
I have come to show you the mirror, Mahi
today, you are experiencing the same thing that you did with Zara
do you remember?
how she was crying
and pleading in front of you, that don't do this cruelty with her
but you didn't listen to her at all
you had insulted her, humiliated her & defamed her in front of everyone
you had ousted her from this house
the same thing is happening with you now, Mahi
whatever you did with Zara few months ago
No
it is like that
you did it all!
you will be treated in the same manner, Mahi
you have to leave this house as well
No no no... I have done nothing!
you will pushed out & ousted from this house
you deserve this!
I haven't done anything with Zara
I haven't done anything, nobody will oust me from here. I have done nothing!
I haven't done anything..
No... its my parents house
they won't oust me
this is my house
I haven't done anything
I haven't done anything at all
what is happening to me?
why am I fighting with Zara?
what is happening to me?
why am I feeling bad when Zara is going away from me?
I always wanted to fix everything
Zaini shall end her anger with me, then...
and when she wants to fix everything today, then why my heart isn't agreeing with her?
why I am not liking Zara's decision of going away from me?
Why?
why am I feeling afraid?
am I in love with Zara?
No, how is this possible?
Zara is my friend & she also considers me her friend
then?
then what is this?
what is this feeling?
why I am not understanding anything?
please have a seat
doctor, is everything fine? Is there anything to worry?
why she was feeling dizzy?
No, its nothing like that. Your Mrs is expecting
Congratulations!
What! really?
both of you are about to become parents
Now you have to take very good care of her. Of her rest, as well as of her diet
I am prescribing a few medicines, do give them to her on time
Ok doctor, I will take care of it

thank you, doctor!
Zaini, what are you doing here?

Why?

Okay

I am fine
Ok fine, come quickly with me

Okay..
