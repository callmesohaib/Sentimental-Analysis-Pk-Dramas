Mahi? Where are you going?
I'm going to my friend Kashaf's. I'll be back in the evening.
Alright. Wait a minute. I'm bringing money.
Drop me at Rabiya's house on way and pick me up on your way back.
Mom, whats wrong. You go yourself. I cannot take you.
Why can't you? Whats wrong? They both live on the same route.
Mom, why are you being stubborn? You're never stubborn. Whats wrong?
Whats wrong with you? I didn't say anything that you're getting so worked up.
If you don't want to take me along, thats a different thing.
No. Its not that.
Come along.
No. I don't want to go with this face of yours.
Mom, whats wrong? Why are you making my mood go bad?
I'm leaving the house after so many days and you're putting me in a bad mood.
Alright. I'm not spoiling your mood. Go. I'm fine.
Really?
Hmm. Go.
Alright. I'm leaving. I'll be back in the evening.
Before evening.
I'll be back.
Bag.. my bag is left. I'll go get it.
Shaista? Where is my tea?
I'm bringing it.
If you can't make it, I'll go out and have it.
Adnan, be patient. I'm coming in 5 minutes.
You've been telling me 5 minutes since the past fifteen minutes.
It seems like you're making trotters and not tea.
You know we have slow gas at this hour.
Its taking time because of this or else I'd have made the tea long ago.
This country has weird problems. No gas, no electricity. You let it be.
I'll have tea outside.
Oh, it has boiled. Wait. I'm bringing it.
Oh God.. Adnan and his anger. The tea is ready and he left.
Mirha? I want to talk to you. Please listen to me once
Leave my hand.
Why are you here? You're stalking me.
Mirha, I want to discuss something very important with you.
I don't want to listen to you. If you take one more step ahead, I'll make noise.
I don't even want to see your face again.
Get lost. Go!
Mirha.. Mirha.. Relax. Nothing happened. Come with me.
This..
You won't come inside?
No.
Alright. At least you came here for me, its enough. Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
You too.
Take care of mom and Zara as well. Bye.
Saad?
How are you? We're meeting after so many days.
Now you're here so come inside. Come.
I'm getting late.
How will you be late? You just came. Come. Leave it now.
How is Zara?
Don't even take her name from your dirty name.
Alright. I won't take her name from my dirty tongue.
But I can remember her.
Those were the days.
Zara lived her and time used to pass by laughing and talking.
The tea Zara made..
It was amazing. Zara..
Shut up with your nonsense.
Whats wrong? Why are you angry?
Do you remember this place?
This is the same place where you hit me and Zara tried to hit me too.
And see what I did.
Your engagement broke and Zara's relation with this house.
This is what we call, killing two targets with one bullet.
I took my revenge.
Right?
Now I'm upset that I cannot get any entertainment in this house after Zara left.
Who should I joke with? Whom should I befriend? There's nobody.
Yes. Dolly is here. Your sister. I'll befriend her
If you even take her name. I'll break your face.
You cannot do that. You cannot do any such thing.
You have no courage. If you could do anything,
you would have done that day.
You don't have the courage.
Your dirty facade..
it will come to the forefront one day.
It will definitely do but it will be very late by then.
I have an advice for you.
Get lost from here and I don't want to see your face in this house.
If I see you again in this house,
I'll destroy you.. you won't be able to show your face to anyone.
Fly as much as you want to.
The day you fall, nobody will come save you.
Bye.
Nobody will save me.. like nobody saved you..
Shaista you?
I spent my entire life with this man. I didn't know he was such a cheap man.
Whats wrong? What are you doing? Is everything alright?
Leave me..
Listen to me.
I don't even want to live with you for a moment.
I couldn't even think you were such a cheap man.
At least listen to me.
I don't want to listen to you. I heard everything with my ears.
You're such a cheap and dirty man.
I didn't even think. I don't want to live with you.
Where are you going? Where will you go?
I can go to hell as far as you care. Move! Don't you dare touch me.
This..
My jewelry? Where is my jewelry?
Where is my jewelry? Tell me, where is it?
How would I know where did your jewelry go? You had kept them here.
Who else would know?
Nobody else other than you knew that I kept my jewelry here. Tell me.
Tell me where is my jewelry.
Are you mad? How would I know where your jewelry is?
Yes I am mad. You're lying. You stole my jewelry.
I don't even want to spend a moment with you.
Listen to me Shaista. You've lost your mind. One minute.
Yes. I have lost my mind. I wasted so many years of my life with you.
I couldn't recognize a man like you. What were you?!
Are you mad? Why aren't you listening to me? Shaista.
Shaista listen to me.
I'm telling you.. don't touch me. Don't! You're a dirty, cheap man.
I'll tell everyone you did everything.
You destroyed Saad and Zara's life.
You are the one who destroyed their life.
And you only didn't destroy Zara's life. You don't have your eyes on her only..
You have eyes on every single girl. And you associated me in this sin as well.
I will tell everyone and show them your real face. I'll tell them how dirty and cheap you are.
You're such a cheap man.
Shaista listen to me.. Listen to me..
I will tell everyone.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear you.
Listen to me Shaista. You'll fall down. Shaista?
Listen to me.. Why are you making so much noise?
I don't want to hear you out.. I..
Shaista?
Mom..
Shaista?
Shaista? Move away. Shaista?
What happened?
I don't know. I was in the room.
She slipped on the stairs. Ambulance?
call Ali...
Shaista?
Dear, call the ambulance. 911.. Call..
Call the ambulance.
Shaista? Shaista?
Did you inform?
I did..
Oh God.. Oh God..
How should we pick her up?
Are you alright, Mirha?
Yes. I..
He left?
Yes he did. And even if he didn't.
He cannot come to the library.
Relax and tell me what happened?
I don't know how he came here Sadaf.
Trust me I haven't contacted him after that day.
He has been following me since two days.
What should I do?
Why didn't you tell me earlier Mirha? I'd have done something.
I didn't understand what to do myself.
He came in front of me all of a sudden. What could I do?
I was scared.
Leave it and relax.
What would he want now?
He has taken everything from me.
My family's peace, our money. He has taken everything.
What more does he want?
What did he tell you? Did he say something?
I didn't understand what he was saying. I don't want to hear anything, Sadaf.
I don't want to talk to him.
Mirha, my dear, relax. We'll do something.
Please come home with me..
We'll leave when we get off.
Mirha, get up and leave. And now relax.
Uncle.. how is aunt now?
I don't know. I couldn't see Shaista's condition.
I don't understand how to handle this situation.
Its good you and Manzoor came. I couldn't understand anything.
Uncle, don't worry. Nothing will happen to aunt, if God wills.
If God wills.
Yes doctor? How is Shaista now?
I'm sorry Mr. Adnan. We couldn't save your wife.
Actually, she had expired before you brought her to the hospital.
But how could..
Actually, the fall from the stairs gave her such a deep injury that she died on the spot.
Please get him to compose himself. Fill in the paperwork and you can take her body.
I'm very sorry. But may God do the best for her.
Uncle..
What..
Body?
Dial your father's number and ask how's Shaista?
Yes mom.. Water..
What happened?
Dad isn't answering.
I don't understand how did she fall down from the stairs.
She came down ten times in a day, never until today..
she slipped. And now she fell face forward.
Before we went to the hospital, she had lost a bucket of blood.
Yes mom, even I don't understand. How did she fall?
Mom.. don't worry. Dad and Ali have gone. Shaista aunty will be alright.
My head isn't working. I don't understand. I should have gone along. 
I shouldn't have listened to Ali.
You call Ali and tell him to come and take me along or else I'll take a rikshah and go.
I'll try Ali.
Brother Ali.. where are you? Mom is worried? Mom wants to come to the hospital? Hows aunty?
What?
What happened?
What did he say?
Mom..
 Aunt..
Aunt passed away..
What? What are you saying Zaini?
Shaista is dead?
She's dead? Oh my God..
Mom..
Oh God..
Mom please compose yourself.
please mom
Mom.. you'll get sick. Mom..
Mom.. no..
Mom, please compose yourself. You'll get sick. Mom..
Oh my God.. How can it be possible? 
Mom..
she was fine until morning
Come..
How do you like my house?
Its beautiful. 
But why isn't anybody here?
I mean, your mother. Where is aunty?
She has gone out for some work.
You said she was waiting for me.
She was waiting but we got late so she left.
So lets do one thing, we'll go as well. I'll meet her some other day.
Wait. Come inside and sit. You just came.
Actually I'm feeling anxious. 
Lets go to a restaurant. We'll sit there.
Why are you being anxious? 
Come. Lets sit. Come.
Come..
Come..
Come sit here with me.
How are you talking to me?
What happened? I'm asking you to sit with me. Whats the problem?
You weren't worried when you came here. Why are you acting now?
Fahad?
Stop acting like a respectable woman in front of me.
I'm not acting.
I think you'll not understand like this. 
Sameer? Iftekhar?
Leave me..
Where are you going?
Fahad.. Who are they?
You really wanted to meet my family.
This is my family.
Why are you doing this to me?
 Why did you bring me here? Spare me for God's sake. Let me leave.
As soon as Sadaf called, I was so anxious. I came running.
You're amazing.
Girls take stress about their education in this age and that's why her blood pressured lowered. 
She had juice. Look how fresh she looks.
All praise to the Lord.
Sadaf, you could have brought her home directly.
Aunty we were coming home. But mom called 
and she said you were coming over so I brought her along.
You did good. I was thinking to come since so many days so I thought I'd come today.
Thank God you found an excuse as well. Tell me hows Mahi. You could have brought her along.
Mahi had gone to her friend's house.
This means everyone went to see their friends today.
Mom, the two of you keep talking. Mirha and I are going to the kitchen to make tea. 
You want something else?
Yes dear, there are kebabs in the freezer. Fry them and bring them along.
Okay mom. Come Mirha.
And tell me whats going on?
Nothing much. I keep doing the house chores the entire day. Sadaf goes to university 
and then I get bored. And you tell me, whats up.
Oh God.. dear, how did it happen? 
You just dropped Dolly a few hours ago.
I don't know mom.
We'll find out when we talk to Dolly in detail. 
What I don't understand how did Shaista aunty fall down?
Dear, who can put off fate? She had this much life. 
But I think we should go there.
Mom, how will we go there? Everybody will be there and they'll say a lot of things. 
Do one thing, you should call.
No, dear. There has been a death there.
Not because of a relationship but even for humanity, we'll have to go there. 
Your sister is there. She'll have to hear taunts. 
Its best if we face people bravely.
Aunty, dad told me not to come to that house. 
He'll get angry if he sees me in these circumstances.
Its alright dear. Parents anger is like soap bubbles. 
It settles down eventually.
And then, both of you have this chance to mend broken relationships.
Zara, mom is right.
What happened to Shaista?
Nothing.
 She fell down the stairs.
But she fell down with a lot of blood everywhere.
 They took her to the hospital.
But she didn't make it.
Be strong. She was always like your sister. Never your tenant or relative.
Yes, we are all helpless against God's will.
She cared for me, more than a sister. 
She never let me feel I didn't have a sister.
 It wasn't time for her to leave.
Its a very sad news. She was too young to die. 
Poor Adnan. He's all alone now.
You're right. Really.
See, Zara is here.
Mom.. Mom, Zara is here.
Rikshah?
Mahi? You?
Mahi? What is this? 
How are you here?
Come along. I'll drop you home. Sit please.
You didn't only destroy Zara's life, you didn't have your eyes on her only.
 You have eyes on every girl in this house.
You involved me in this crime as well. 
I'll tell everyone and show everyone your real face. 
I'll tell everyone how cheap and dirty you are.
You're such a bad man.. leave me..
Shaita listen to me..
Are you okay? 
Don't worry. You're safe now.
Anybody can doubt you in such a situation. 
Your family will get worried if they see you like this.
Does this make a difference?
Don't be stubborn and listen to me. Relax.
Please drop me home. I have to go home.
Okay.
Why was she so scared? Should I ask her? 
No. I have no relation with her.
What she did with me.. 
But why am I thinking about her? 
I shouldn't think about her.
Fahad.. the girl you wooed is very beautiful.
I'm warning you. Stay away from me.
Take care. I'm coming.
What will you do? There's nobody who'll listen to you here.
Stay away from me. Stay away...
Stop her..
Go.. get the car.
Whats wrong? Why has Mahi in the dark?
I don't know mom..
Should I go and ask her?
No. Go and heat dinner, your father will be home soon. I'll go and see. Mahi?
Mahi? Mahi?
Mahi?
Its you..
What happened to you? When did you come?
 Why are all the lights switched off? Is everything okay? You feeling well?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
Mom, I have a headache.
I'll get you medicine.
No. I'll take it in a bit, mom.
Listen..
Bushra was missing you. She complained why I didn't bring you along. 
You'll have to go with me the next time.
Mom, I have a headache. 
I want to sleep.
Alright. Sleep. Call me if you need anything.
