I went to meet him on the gate but he was not there.
When I opened the door those robbers entered the house.
Was he with those boys? Is he a robber?
No Mahi, he was not there.
I shouldn't have talked to you in that tone.
Saad, at least you can forgive your friend.
Shall I bring flowers for you?
Yes please, the ones which are in fashion these days.
Zara, is everything alright?
Yes, I am here.
OK. Good bye.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I was feeling suffocated in there so I came out for smoking.
I can't sit in women gathering.
Yes, I know that.
And
Hey.
It's a family function. So please be careful.
Oh, sorry. 
Thank you.
Are you going back? OK.
Wait. Good bye.
Did you enjoy?
No.
How are you?
Fine
Zara, did you see?
Mahi intentionally dropped that dish.
She can't see your happiness.
Look, I don't know what are you thinking about me at the moment.
She can't bear this Zara.
So
You are intentionally pushing yourself towards that hole.
You have still time to think about it.
You have still time to make a right decision.
Adeel is with me.
He will handle Maham.
Maham has done that intentionally, why don't you ask about it.
I will ask.
I will definitely ask if she will say anything to me.
Aren't you afraid Zara?
No.
OK then, do whatever you want to do. If you don't care about yourself then why am I worried about you?
Are you blind? Can't you see?
I am not blind but I can't see what is happening right now.
What is the compulsion of your job?
It's your sister's marriage, everyone was asking about you. Why can't you come here?
As I told you that I couldn't come because I didn't have any leaves. Anyways, dad informed me very late.
Yes, you are right.
Everything happened so quickly.
We didn't even know till last week that we will be attending Zara's wedding this week.
Yes, you are right.
Anyways, I will come tomorrow.
I will reach by tomorrow evening.
If God wills.
I missed you so much.
I always miss you.
You are coming so late. You have neither prepared nor you have done any shopping so what will you wear on wedding.
You don't have anything to wear that's why I asked you to come a bit early and would do some shopping.
Boys don't do such shopping.
I will manage.
Tell me about your preparation.
No, I haven't done anything. I am waiting for you. I will go for shopping with you when you will come.
I want to wear something as per your choice.
OK, I will take you to shopping tomorrow. Take care.
OK, take care.
Good bye.
Remember one thing my child.
Your father is alive.
And your house is in tact.
Don't tolerate with anyone's cruelty.
The doors of this house will always remain open for you.
Sarwat, meet your daughter.
Don't worry, she is going to her own house.
You meet her as well.
Go with Zara.
Well, you got married now.
You did what you wanted to do.
Let me go, I am so tired and I have to take rest.
By the way, you didn't do right Adeel.
You hurt your mother's feelings.
You will never live happily.
Let's go, will I have to give you invitation.
My child, don't mind their words.
Give them some time, they will be alright.
May God always bless both of you.
Don't worry, I will correct everything.
Let me talk to her.
Maham, what are you doing? Maham.
Leave me, what are you doing Maham?
Adeel.
What happened to you? Why are you so scared?
Where were you?
I was making noodles for me.
Did you watch any dream?
That was a very bad dream.
I am so scared.
Who gets scared by watching a dream?
But I am scared. Recite some verses on me.
OK, I will do that but first I will eat my noodles.
Will you eat?
By the way, what did you see in dream that you are so scared.
Are you mad? We shouldn't tell others about our bad dreams.
OK, don't tell me.
But please, stop scaring.
And try to sleep.
If you won't sleep well then how will you look beautiful at your wedding function?
Hey, please stop crying. That was just a dream.
OK, let me recite verses. Please stop crying.
Lie down, I will recite verses.
Your dad wanted to share the half cost of Henna function.
But I asked him why?
Then he said that if we had to arrange the separate functions then we would have spent money on that.
What's wrong with you?
They only decorated their lawn. There was not so much expense.
And what's wrong with dad, why will he share the half expense.
So tell this to your father and brother.
Your dad is so keen to give everything to his sister.
He did the same thing on Sarwat's marriage.
He gave everything to Sarwat and that too in excessive quantity.
Really?
It's OK then, let's see what aunt will give to Zara.
Dad gave her so many things. Right?
Now it's her turn to pay back.
Hey.
She can't give that much.
Her name is Sarwat.
She can't give a minor things and you are talking about dowry.
Didn't you see
What did she do at Maheen's wedding.
Oh God, I checked the bottom of pots, those were very sub standard.
It looked as if she made those pots from oil canisters.
I told her as well, I couldn't stop myself.
And those blankets, even the shawls of Hyderabad are more warmer than those.
But aunt did the right thing mom.
She knew that Maheen won't have to live there so she saved money.
Tell me, did you talk to her in-laws?
She is such a clever woman.
She didn't say a single word.
She is so mean, same like Sarwat.
Hmm
OK, you don't have to talk to her
And if you talk to her then only praise Maheen in front of her.
Are you getting my point?
Go to hell. I don't care.
Hey, we have to go to market tomorrow. It's a very tough task.
Yes, it's very late. But let me tell you one thing.
Time passes so quickly when we backbite against others.
Hey, this is not backbiting.
It's a discussion between mother and daughter.
If someone else will say that then it will be considered as backbiting, it's a discussion among us.
No, it's backbiting.
Stop this nonsense.
Let me switch off the light.
Yes, switch off the light.
Oh God.
How are you?
I am absolutely fine. You surprised me.
Mom, dad, Zara come quickly. Look who is here.
Do you know, all of us were missing you so much.
I was also missing you so much.
Tell me, have you brought all those things which I asked you to bring?
Things?
I forgot to bring those.
You forgot.
OK then you can't enter this house, you can leave this house immediately. Right now, right away.
Listen to me Zenny.
Thank God.
What a surprise.
How are you?
I am fine.
Let's inform your dad. Bring your bag.
He didn't even tell us.
Dad.
Look who is here.
Greetings.
Uncle, greetings.
Greetings.
I am absolutely fine. Do you know, I waited for you so much and I missed you so much.
I know that's why I have come here as soon as I got leaves.
You did the right thing but now I won't let you go back quickly.
OK boss.
Bring a cup of tea for me.
Bring tea for brother and also serve lunch for him.
OK.
Uncle, please sit.
How was your journey?
That was good, I didn't observe any tiredness because of excitement.
It's a wonderful feeling to meet your family.
And you did the right thing to come here, all of us were missing you so much.
Yes uncle. Where is Adeel?
He has gone to saloon with his mother and sister.
Well, he is groom but your aunt doesn't understand that.
Oho, what a pleasant surprise.
How are you?
I am fine.
Greetings.
Greetings. How are you?
Hey, you have put on some weight.
I am just joking. You are a fit guy.
Hey dude.
Sit.
Now, everyone will feel happy because you are here.
Tell me about your routine these days.
I am searching job these days and mom is not feeling well.
Don't worry, you will find a good job.
You did right to come here Saad.
You have to do so many things.
Have lunch first then you have to go to do that work.
OK aunt.
Mom, where is dad?
Your dad has gone to market. There are so many things to do for wedding preparations.
Tell me about yourself.
You are so fond of creating drama.
So do my mimicry in front of everyone.
Now, tell everyone.
That aunt was apologizing like this.
Will you give her this set.
Don't ask me, if it's in my authority then I don't want to give her even a single stick.
The more we will give her the more she will dominate us.
Mom, can I take this one?
Do whatever you want to do and let me free as soon as possible.
OK, I am keeping this one.
If dad and Adeel ask you then tell them that you will give her at Valima. Right?
OK.
Tell me where is that thing, that is the most important thing.
That is there. Let me bring that.
Bring that quickly.
What happened? Stop, do you want to drink water?
What are you doing here?
You needed my help so I came here to help you.
I don't need anyone's help. Please go.
No, you need my help to drink water so let me give you.
I don't want to drink water. Please go.
Just wait.
Take it.
I don't want to drink water. Please leave.
Don't you want to drink water?
No?
No, please leave.
OK, let me drink it.
OK, I am going. If you need any kind of help then you can tell me.
Please go.
Ah.
Are you OK?
Yes, I am alright.
Do you need anything?
Yes, I want to drink water.
OK, let me give you.
It's enough.
Do you want to drink more?
No, thanks.
Tell me, how is it?
It's so so.
OK.
Let me see.
Hmm.
It's so beautiful just like you.
What's this?
My name is not written here.
You didn't write my name.
The names written by henna are erased.
Because it's color erases someday.
Then where did you write my name?
On your heart.
Nowhere.
Saad.
Leave my hand. Everyone is watching.
No.
Saad.
Look at this set, I have bought this set with my choice.
By the grace of God.
I could manage this much in a hurry.
Please forgive me, if anything is left.
No sister Farida, everything is so beautiful. And you don't have to show anyone.
You have brought everything with love for your daughter. God will do better for her.
What are you talking about Sarwat?
We have to do this much because it's our tradition. It's not a foreign wedding.
I had to do something. Right?
Shaista.
Look at this, how beautiful it is.
Why are you showing them?
Call your younger son-in-law, what is his name?
Saad.
Yes Saad. Ask Saad to come here.
I have brought a special gift for him. I will give him his gift first.
After that I will show all other things.
Maheen, call Saad.
Yes, call him quickly.
Saad.
Aunt Farida is calling you.
She is calling me?
Yes.
Where is Saad? Here he is.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings. So you are here.
I was waiting for you very anxiously.
You were waiting for me.
But why?
She has brought a gift for you.
Yes, I have brought a very special gift for you. You will like that so much.
Give me that.
Look at it.
Did you like it? Hmm?
You are so fond of creating dramas.
So do my mimicry in front of everyone.
Now tell everyone.
That aunt was apologizing like this.
No, you don't want to do that.
OK, as you wish. So just show us your dance skills.
Sister Farida, what are you doing?
It's your dear friend's wedding so it's mandatory.
Aunt, this is rude from your side.
Hey, I am not rude, ask your brother.
I saw him with my eyes that day.
He was doing my mimicry in front of everyone by wearing scarf.
That aunt apologizes like this so I am asking him to do the same thing now.
I am not saying any new thing.
Aunt, that was just a joke.
Why are you taking that thing seriously.
I am also joking my child.
Did you mind my joke?
OK, if you did mind that then let me apologize.
Let me beg for forgiveness. Please forgive me.
I made this mistake to defame your son-in-law.
Did you like it? Hmm?
You are so fond of creating dramas.
So do my mimicry in front of everyone now.
Now tell everyone.
That aunt was apologizing like this.
Zara, why didn't you say anything there?
What does she think?
That they can do anything. She misbehaved with him so much but we didn't say anything.
Aunt Farida, misbehaved so much with Saad.
Saad is very hurt because of her act.
She shouldn't have done that.
Aunt has taken revenge from Saad for that day.
Yes, she was looking for this opportunity.
Such people are so mean.
I was telling mom, I knew that something was bubbling up in her mind.
But no one listened to me. It's OK then, just bear with it.
Zara, call Saad.
He is so upset. Please.
Can I come in?
Yes dad.
Are you ready?
Yes, I was packing my things.
Are you happy?
Yes dad.
Stay happy always.
I have brought all three of you with so much love and care.
I have tried my best that there is no difference between Ali and you (sisters). I loved all of you in same manner.
But you are my dearest daughter.
Remember my one thing.
The grievances may blind fold our relations.
It's necessary to give importance to relations and by doing that bond of love is created in relations.
You have to give respect to every relation that all grievances may remove.
And your love and sincerity should remove all misunderstandings.
I will try my best that you won't have any complaints.
But remember one thing, if anyone misbehaves with you then you will tell me and you won't hide anything from me.
Your father is alive.
And he will always be there with you.
Don't think that you are alone.
I will remember every single word of yours.
I will miss you so much.
Please forgive me, I have hurt you so much.
No my child.
You have complete right on your father. Daughters don't apologize to fathers.
Smile.
Zara.
Come with us, we have a surprise for you.
Surprise.
Don't ask. Let's go and see yourself.
Go, they have arranged everything with so much love.
