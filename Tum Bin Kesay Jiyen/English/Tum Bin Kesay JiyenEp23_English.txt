I'm happy with you here.
I will not listen to anything Zara.
I've told mother and I'm telling you.
I will not cancel my plan at any cost.
I was missing mother.
Is that it? Come here.
Let me read it.
Adeel!
Please tell me where my son is... is he alright?
Yes he is alright.
But he's in the hospital. He's been in an accident.
Accident, where and how? Is he alright? Is he injured?
Uncle?
The doctors are saying that no one is allowed to meet him.
What do you mean not allowed?
How can that be?
They won't stop me. Tell them that I'm his mother and he's my son.
They will not stop me, they can't. 
I want to meet him. Talk to them.
What are you doing? You aren't saying anything. Say something.
Fareeda calm down.
Pray for your son. Pray for Adeel.
This is not fair.
Fareeda I said calm down. Please sit down.
Sit down please. Sit and pray.
Tell me the truth, don't lie to me.
What are the doctors saying? How is Adeel feeling?
He's not well uncle.
He is in a bad state.
What about Zara?
She's better.
She's regained consciousness. They have taken her to get X-rays
Are you saying that Adeel hasn't woken up yet?
The doctors are trying their best, please be hopeful.
I'll be right back.
Tell them that I'm his mother. Let me go and meet him.
Calm down.
He's going to find out. I want to see him.
I wonder how my son must be.
How are you my dear?
Uncle, where's Adeel?
Adeel...
Please let us go, we have to take her to her room.
Where's my son?
Where's Adeel?
Fareeda calm down.
Be patient and pray for him.
But where is he? Look at her, she's fine.
How's my son? Why aren't they letting us meet him?
Visitation is allowed in hospital. I'm his mother I'm sure they'll let me meet him.
Calm yourself down. Mahi take care of your mother. I'll go and find out.
What kind of hospital is this? Why aren't they letting me meet my son?
Sit down. He's fine.
Where's Adeel?
He'll be back from the operation theater soon.
Saad, how much more time will it take?
We're almost there. We'll be there in ten minutes.
Who's this? Ahmed...
Adeel...
Adeel!
My Adeel!
My Adeel! No... my son... he's my son... I won't let him go...
I won't let my son go... they've taken my son away.
Control yourself.
I won't let my son go... my son!
I will die without him.
My son... bring back my son... I will die without my son.
Mahi... where's Zara? Where's Adeel?
Zara is fine.
But my brother... he's gone.
My brother has left us.
Brother... what is she saying? What happened to Adeel?
He's dead. My son is dead.
Your daughter killed my son. She took away his life!
My son has left this Earth.
Are you happy now? Are you here to witness our tragedy?
Witness it! Are you happy now? My only son left me!
Mahi.... Mahi... ask them to go away from here. I don't want to see anyone's face.
I don't want to see anyone's face. She killed my son.
Brother.
Zara.
How are you?
How did this happen?
Where's Adeel? I haven't seen him. I asked uncle as well. Where's Adeel?
I'll bring Adeel.
Saad, I want to see him.
I'll call him.
Go and bring Adeel.
I'll bring him.
Is Adeel okay?
Yes, he's fine. I'll bring him.
I want to see him, just once.
We are helpless.
Father.
Why did this happen?
Be strong father. We have to look after Zara.
Where's Zara?
She's on her way.
Control yourself.
Where's uncle Ahmed?
Be patient my sister. He belonged to God and He has taken him back.
We cannot do anything but be patient.
How can I be patient?
My child is gone. How can I be patient?
He won't come back.
I won't be able to live without my son. How will be able to live without my son?
Control yourself Fareeda and pray for your son.
Where's Zara?
Is she at the hospital?
Why does it matter? 
My brother isn't alive anymore, so what's the point?
My dear, I was only asking because I wanted to know if she was fine.
Mother told them not to go, but no one listened.
Zara killed my brother. She didn't listen to my mother.
Don't say such things. People are listening, what will they say?
Mother... where's Adeel? Why isn't anyone telling me anything?
My dear...
Saad, where's Adeel? 
Why are you just taking me and not Adeel from the hospital?
Silence yourself for a while my dear.
He's not well. Where is he?
We are going to him.
I understand.
You guys want to surprise me. 
Adeel has a habit of doing that.
Why does he have to surprise me today?
Did you not make him understand, Saad?
They'll be here any moment now.
They are here.
Zara...
Sister.
Bring water for her please.
Hurry up... Zara please open your eyes.
Mother...
Zara...
Zara...
Adeel I kept telling you, but you didn't listen to your mother.
If he had listened to me he would have been alive today.
I kept saying that she is accursed, but no one listened to me.
No one listened to me.
Shaista! Brother Manzoor called, Adeel has passed away.
Why are you saying such things?
Brother Manzoor called me and told me that Adeel is no more. 
He wasn't even able to talk properly on the phone...
He was crying...
Adnan...
None us could have ever imagined this.
Zara is so young.
In her youth..
she has been widowed.
We should go there.
No, brother Manzoor asked us not to.
He said that Ali would go there directly from Islamabad. 
Brother Manzoor's relatives will be visiting. I've talked in the mosque...
They were offer the funeral prayers here.
Evil has taken away the happiness of those children.
What can we do? This was all that was written for them.
How's Zara? Does she know?
I don't think she knows yet, but she will.
She's with Saad, what else does she want?
Adnan, this is not the time for such things.
Don't say such things... we have to die one day as well.
Pray for Adeel's forgiveness and pray that Zara find patience.
I'll go to the mosque and check in on the prayer arrangement.
Why did this happen?
Mother, water.
My Lord... that poor boy.
Dolly... my dear we should have gone there.
Mother, we couldn't go because of your health. 
Everyone knows this.
My blood pressure and these headaches just won't leave me.
I want to be there for them. I can't stand staying here.
Evil eyes has taken away their happiness. 
They looked so happy on their wedding day.
I prayed for their well being.
Mother... whatever God wills.
We made a mistake by staying. 
Nothing would have happened if I went there.
Mother.
We can't do anything now. All we can do is pray for his forgiveness.
May God give everyone patience. Don't cry... drink water.
Enough. Don't cry anymore.
They look so beautiful.
Hmm... they look average.
You coming here was enough.
You didn't need to light them on fire.
Those dialogues sound nice in a nineties film.
No one is impressed by them anymore. But nice try.
If it was a nice effort...
then I should get a reward.
What are you doing Adeel? What if someone sees?
They'll think that your empty hands do not look nice.
Go away from here. Everyone must be looking for us. They must be wondering where we are.
If only... we could disappear.
I would have taken you and disappeared.
Let go of my hand and leave.
Wait a second, I have something for you.
You remembered.
You remembered as well.
That's why you didn't wear bangles.
Thank you Adeel.
Anything for you.
What are you doing? You cannot take Adeel away.
I won't let Adeel go anywhere.
You killed him.
I cannot live without my son!
Don't take Adeel away from me!
She's so unlucky. She just got married. Last time I visited she was a bride...
and now I'm here because of a funeral. My heart feels for them.
This is a tragedy for that poor girl.
The tragedy occurred in this house the day this accursed girl was married into this home.
Her shadow is not good for this house.
There is a reason my heart could never accept her.
Because of her...
I tried making Adeel understand, but he didn't listen to me.
 If he had listened to me, he would be alive right now.
I kept saying that she is accursed, but no one listened to me.
What's the matter with you sister... what are you saying?
Be mindful of what you say.
I will not.
I am not in my senses. My son has died.
He has been buried!
Don't give me your advice. Ask her...
Ask your daughter. What did I ever do to her?
For what did she take her revenge from me?
I always said that is not good for this house. She is accursed!
That she would ruin everything and she did!
Adeel would have agreed, but she dug her claws into him.
Still you want me to say nothing. 
You want me to stay in my senses? I will speak!
I will tell the entire world that whatever happened was because of her!
Her stubbornness killed my son.
Enough auntie.
What are you saying? 
The one who died wasn't just your son, but he was my sister's husband.
My sister is a widow.
She's just been widowed.
What about what I lost? I lost my son, what does she care?
She will find a new husband. Who will bring my son back to me?
Who will bring my son back to me? My son has left this world.
Adeel...
Auntie...
Enough Zaini!
For God's sake not one more word. This is no time to fight.
Sister, for God's sake silence yourself.
Mother, come inside.
Why? Why should I go inside? Ask them to leave.
Get out of this house. Ask her to get out of my sight! I don't want to see her face!
The funeral is over. 
These people have no place in this house anymore!
Go... get out of this house. I won't go inside.
Get her out of my sight. She killed my son!
Mother I won't go.
This is Adeel's house. I can't leave Adeel's house. Why would I kill Adeel?
Mother... I didn't do anything. How can I kill him?
I didn't kill him. I won't leave this house. Mother...
Remove her from this house. 
I can't see her face.
I won't leave this house.
My brother loved my very much. He used to listen to me.
He never stopped me from doing anything. 
He always agreed with everything I said.
Before leaving he got me talking again, so I don't require anyone's help.
Then he left me. He didn't even think how all of us would live without him.
Control yourself. Look what you've done to yourself.
Will you eat something? Should I bring something for you?
No... where's sister...
she was crying, I'm going to her
She has her family. Why are you worrying?
All of this has happened because of her. Why are you worrying about her?
What are you saying?
This didn't happen because of her. Brother loved her.
Sister Zara loved my brother. 
She couldn't do something like this.
Alright fine... don't cry please.
I miss my brother.
There was so much blood.
Adeel's shirt was filled with blood.
You saw it, right father. Auntie tried to stop us.
She asked us not to go... she constantly told us not to go.
But we didn't listen to her. I didn't listen to her.
This is not your fault. 
Why are you thinking like this? You didn't do anything wrong.
It's my fault, I should have listened to her. If I had he would be alive today.
This wouldn't have happened. Why didn't I listen to her?
Why didn't I listen to her?
Do you see her? 
Why are you silent? Why don't you say anything?
I will not leave you here.
What should I tell her?
What should I say?
I don't have anything to say.
I won't let my daughter stay in this hell.
I will take you with me. I will not let you stay here.
I should have listened to her. I didn't listen to her.
I didn't listen.
