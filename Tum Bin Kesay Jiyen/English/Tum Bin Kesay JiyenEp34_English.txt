You don't want to marry because of Zara.
Are you insane Zaini? Where has Zara come from?
She has always been between us.
And this truth will never change.
You wanted to take revenge from me, right?
Revenge? Why would I take revenge from you?
What I'm thinking is right.
You didn't get any happiness, that's why you can't tolerate mine.
It's not like that. Life has become very weird.
There is always some tension in life.
What happened Saad? You seem really worried to me.
I miss you very much.
If only you were here, there would be no problem in life.
Sister Mahi you look beautiful today.
Thank you. Have I never looked beautiful before today?
No, you have always been beautiful.
Are you ready now?
Sadaf let's go outside.
Don't worry about her, you know she's always emotional.
Tell me how I look.
You look very pretty.
Show me your hand.
Perfect.
What?
But...
What happened?
What happened? Who was it?
Uncle, how do I look?
What happened? Why aren't you guy saying anything?
He got a call and since then he isn't saying anything.
Say something.
Thank you brother for taking us out for a lovely dinner.
What's there to thank for?
I don't think Maheen liked it.
I don't think she liked us coming with you two.
No mother, it's not like that at all.
Right Maheen?
Usama is right... there's nothing like this.
Really... then why aren't you having your soup, it's completely cold.
If you don't like it, order something else.
I am drinking it, I like to have it cold.
Enough, how many pictures will you guys take.
Just one more... come on take one more.
She doesn't like any one of her pictures.
You don't look nice, sister will you take one of us?
I'll take it.
No, let me take it... give it to me.
Pass your phone...
Give her your phone.
Give her your phone.
Take a nice one sister.
Come on!
Sister... if the picture isn't nice, please take another one.
Sure...
These pictures are enough!
This is my suit... Shela why did you wear it?
Which dress? Which dress did I wear? I didn't wear any dress.
Oh that one! I liked it...
so I wore it.
The time is near... ask where they are.
Sure I'll find out. My dear bring my phone, it's inside.
They should have been here by now.
Is it fine?
Zaini... check and see if Mahi is ready or not.
Today is her day, let her take as much time as she needs. Just be happy.
Of course you are right Sarwat. But it's so late and we should at least know.
Alright go and check.
Let me ask Ahmed about the barat.
She gets so concerned.
Here you are.
Thank you.
The phone is ringing. I think it's a signal issue.
Try with his phone.
Let me try one more time... it's them calling.
Greetings brother Noor.
We are waiting for you, everything is ready here. When will you guys be here?
What... but...
Brother Noor...
Hello... brother Noor.
Is everything alright?
They have refused, they are saying that they are not coming
Ahmed... Ahmed... call them. Ask where the barat is.
Everyone is asking me, what should I answer them?
They are not coming.
What do you mean they aren't coming?
I don't like this joking habit of yours.
This is no occasion to joke. Ask them when they will be here.
I told you that they are not coming.
Why aren't they coming? My daughter is getting married, this is no joke.
This is no way... pass me the phone.
Fareeda!
Is the barat here Mirha?
What's the matter? Why are you crying?
They have refused to bring the barat.
What?
Why didn't you say anything to them?
How can they deceive us like this?
Brother Ahmed is not replying.
How will they agree? That's how liars are... they always attack your back.
I've told you so many times not to send a proposal there.
We should have married in our status.
But you cared for your old neighborhood and your old friend.
Look what happened because of it.
Miss... I don't understand...
how this happened.
I was about to tell you mother...
but I was so confused that I was wrong.
I confirmed from a few friends and then told you about it.
Thank God that we learned all of this before the wedding.
What would we have done if we had learned this after the wedding?
Zaviar... where are you going?
Do you see how much we had to suffer because of one mistake.
Look how worried he is...
What  I don't understand...
is how they deceive us like this?
What did you do?
You lied... you told me that you had told me about the divorce.
Why did you lie to me?
You lied!
Brother Ahmed... everyone's watching.
They are such liars and deceivers!
I didn't expect them to be like this.
She is marrying her daughter for a second time, that too by lying.
I could never imagine this.
You guys can go... we beg your forgiveness.
Yes, we are leaving!
What's the point of us staying here? Let's go everyone!
Mahi!
Mahi, please open the door.
Mahi, please open the door.
Auntie...
Ahmed... listen to me
Go away from here, I don't want to see you face.
You betrayed me.
By doing this you have ruined my daughter's life.
You are her mother and you stole your daughter's happiness.
You have murdered by trust.
You told me that Mahi had told Zaviar about her divorce.
Silence yourself.. I don't want to hear it.
Whatever that happened today was because of you.
Is this how you repay me for my trust?
I didn't die when my son died, but today...
you have buried me alive.
I don't even have the strength to look people in they eye anymore.
You have turned my honor into ashes.
You did all of it.
Do you know why brother Noor refused?
Because they are respectable people who were looking for honorable people to marry into.
They do not get married into liars like us!
They do not!
Everything is over Fareeda.
Everything is over.
Truth is the basis for a girl getting married.
They are not built on lies you foolish woman!
They are build on truth.
Brother Ahmed.
Brother.... bring water for your uncle.
Bring a seat...
Brother Ahmed sit down.
Why did you do this to me Mahi?
What did Saad wanted to say that he couldn't say in front of us?
How do I know?
But I want to know what it is.
Adnan... why do you involve yourself in other people's business?
Do you see what they do behind my back!?
Didn't I tell you that they steal my things in my absence?
What do you have to say now?
Maheen this is something very minor. You're being angry for no reason.
A minor thing?
This is a minor thing to you?
What if they steal something big, will you still say the same thing?
Maheen enough!
They are my sisters! You cannot say anything like that about them.
If they are your sisters, will they do anything?
What has she done? She just wore a suit, don't sister's share clothes?
They are not my sisters, they are your sisters. They are my sisters-in-law.
Do you see how she's differentiating?
Don't you differentiate between me and your sisters?
Look at her tongue?
I'm justified to speak out,
and if push comes to shove I will scream as well!
Enough... you are making mountains out of mole hills.
Mother... don't cry...
Sister Mahi is crying as well, father is angry as well.
I told Mahi not to do this, but she didn't listen to me.
Mother... you shouldn't have listened to sister Mahi.
How could I have known that this would happen.
Father is angry at you as well.
Are you here to add salt to my wounds.
mom, I was just...
Enough! I don't need your sympathy.
Go away from here!
Mirha leave me alone... go.
Sister...
What is it?
Go and apologize to sister-in-law.
I should apologize? Don't you see how unreasonable she is?
Don't you see how bad things are around the house? Because of that brother is so angry.
For our brother listen to me and apologize.
What's the matter with you? Why are you so angry?
Brother... sister, I made a mistake.
I will never take any one of your things without your permission.
Look at my hands, please forgive me and improve your mood.
Go to you room.
Are you happy now making my daughter apologize like that?
And you Usama... what kind of brother are you watching all this?
What do you want from me? You two tell you me what you want from me?
I've tolerated enough... I will not let your wife have her way anymore!
If she can fight so much over a suit, then Lord knows what she might do over something major.
Maheen listen to me with open ears...
if you can't give this house a child, then there's no place in this house for you.
It's the same thing every day!
Where's Zara? Making tea?
I was saying that we should prepare to leave.
It seems what we came here for won't be happening.
I don't feel like leaving my brother.
My brother is in pain and I can't stand to see him like this.
Sister did this... she always makes my brother restless.
Don't say such things, this will make things bad for Zara.
Good... we'll take her with us.
Mother... I will not go.
What do you mean? You told me...
that as soon as the wedding ends you will come home with us...
I did mother but...
things were different back then. Everyone needs me here.
Whatever happened here was because of sister and Mahi.
I don't want you live here in such a stressful environment.
I can't be selfish about this. There is only one reason behind what Mahi did.
She feared that if they learned the truth they might break off the relationship.
What changed? The relationship has been broken.
Why did they lie? They shouldn't have. Have they no sense?
Mahi is in a bad state. Uncle is worried as well...
please don't say anything like that to him as well.
That's why I'm asking you to come with us. You cannot stay happy here.
Mother, you guys should go there.
What about your sister's and brother's weddings?
You are there with them... my prayers are with them. I cannot go there right now.
Father... make her understand.
Wait a minute. End this conversation...
Let's do what Zara is saying. 
Do as you please... we will not pressurize you.
Thank you father.
Mother did you keep your medicine?
I don't know... maybe.
I'll help you pack.
You guys were supposed to come back after two days.
How come you're back so early?
Such was the situation. I don't know how to tell you.
May God have mercy... what happened?
Is Zara okay?
Yes she is...
What we went there for couldn't happen...
the groom's family refused to show up at the vital moment.
Sister didn't tell them about Mahi's first marriage.
My God!
How can sister lie about something like that?
She must have lied for her daughter.
Don't take it the wrong way but your niece is very sharp.
She bothered Zara so much. What she's facing is karma, right brother?
What we reap..
is what we sow.
Often in life... because of our mistakes... other people suffer...
Which is something we don't realize. Whatever that happened to Mahi...
was tragic. Rather than checking whose fault it was, we must think...
how to get out of this situation.
You are right but..
what about Mahi? She has been defamed in front of her extended family.
What can we say?
God will make everything better. 
I pray that things get better over there as well.
Amen.
Uncle.
I know that all of you are worried at the moment.
But I want to talk to you all about something, in private.
Let's go Shaista... allow us to leave brother.
What's the matter Saad?
What did Saad wanted to talk about that he couldn't say in front of us?
What do I know?
But I want to find out what it is.
Adnan... why do you have a habit of interfering in other people's business?
You could try focusing on us as well.
For God's sake don't start again... 
things have gotten better for us after such a long time. Let me hear.
If someone hears... Adnan let's go..
Uncle Adnan...
Why are you guys standing here? Who's inside?
Saad is back... he's here to talk to your mother-in-law.
Don't you know what it is?
No.
Yes, Saad is here.
He wanted to talk about something important, that's why we came outside.
Yes go inside.
We should leave Adnan.
Let's go.
Uncle the thing is that...
I cannot marry right now.
I want some time.
What do you need time for?
We thought that you were happy with the decision.
 It never occurred to us that you would have a problem with this.
What's the matter?
I know...
I don't have any objections.
Then what's the matter? Why aren't you telling us?
I respect you uncle.
After father's death, I've always put you in his place.
From school till college you were always there for my admissions.
You were the the one who got me enrolled in university
Like Ali, you always thought of me as your son.
You never made me realize that I was an orphan.
That I don't have a father.
You took care of all my likes and dislikes...
I...
I respect all of your decisions but...
I cannot marry right now.
The only reason behind that is that...
I want to stand on my feet.
Uncle... I just got hired...
I want to work very hard.
I want to be...
worthy of your daughter.
I don't want...
Zaini to ask me of something in the future and I am unable to give it to her.
I won't like it.
I want to give her all the happiness in the world.
That's why I want some time.
But... things could still happen the same way.
Do we have shortage of anything? 
Dolly won't ask anything of us, nor Zaini will demand anything of you.
I know auntie... but as a big brother it's my duty...
that I give my sister everything that she deserves on her wedding day.
And... as a husband I want to make Zaini happy.
That's why I'm asking some time.
You're acting like a stranger.
 Both weddings will be arranged together. I'm here.
Uncle... you've been there for us ever since we were children.
But... I don't to take away Zaini using the money...
that you would give me. Do you understand?
I want to stand on my feet and keep Zaini happy.
So...
So that she doesn't feel that she chose the wrong man.
That's why I'm asking you for some time. Please give me some time.
I promise that I will always keep Zaini happy. I will never make her cry.
She will never regret her decision.
Bless you my son.
I'm proud of you... your parents have raised you well.
Thank you uncle.
