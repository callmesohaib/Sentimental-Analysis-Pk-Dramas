Adeel and Zara have been married.
What difference does it make brother?
This is Adeel's aunt's home, he can come her anytime he wants.
And he can leave whenever he wants.
When he goes there, she'll sit with him and provoke him against us.
What can I say to her when my own son doesn't give me any importance.
As far as Zara is concerned, I'm sure she'll try to provoke him.
If not today, then tomorrow.
Your husband was a contractor, did you start doing the same work?
He wasn't a contractor, he was a builder.
He used to make buildings, but he was unable to make a home for himself.
You taunted me, right?
I will surely return the favor.
But at the right time.
Zara sit with them...
I'll take care of this.
I'll make this, you go and sit with them.
I'm not going there, I've already greeted them...
and I cannot tolerate Maham more than five minutes.
Why did Adeel brought her with him?
And you didn't refuse.
She's his sister. How can I ask him not to bring his sister?
So what if she's his sister. Don't give her so much importance only because she's his sister.
She's his sister, but your sister-in-law.
Lord knows how you will manage with these people?
How much time will it take, everyone is waiting.
And yes... sister Maria went to her room and asked for her tea there.
Do you see? She does this on purpose.
It's not like that, maybe she's tired. She traveled such a long way.
She just wants to impose her importance.
She wants you to start catering to her needs.
Please lower your voice. Zaini... I'll pour the tea for you to serve.
I'm not taking the tea, you can take it yourself.
Pour the tea, I'll take it to her.
Why will you go? Zaini will take it.
Let her go.
I'll give her the tea, that too without the biscuits. Give it to me.
Zain could have served her...
Where's the tray?
I've taken it, forget it. I'll serve it to her.
Why didn't you go?
I have no intention of being insulted.
Tell me, shall I take this?
Do whatever you want.
Mother what can I say? No one even came to receive us
And... your son is bending down in front of everyone like he's the daughter-in-law.
I feel so weird. I wasn't an idiot for letting him leave.
I'm his mother, I know my son well.
You can write down my words, all his life he'll serve his in-laws.
And when Zara comes here, she will rule over our house.
Nothing is hidden from me. I know their family well.
It is such a weird family, they still haven't served me tea.
They know we traveled a long way and are tired. They should have arranged for the tea a while ago.
There is no arrangement. I got up and left.
Why would I listen to them?
Adeel has no respect in this house.
How will it be? Why would they respect him?
They don't know how to respect someone and Adeel...
If he goes there frequently...
and takes entire suitcases to their home like a porter, then he'll be treated like a porter.
Son-in-laws aren't supposed to be this way.
I forgot to tell you, Mahi is still home. I think she has been divorced.
I don't care if she's divorced.
Forget about her and tell me, did Zara meet your properly?
Yes she did... but you never know what's going on in one's heart.
Someone's at the door, I'll talk to you later. I'll call you later.
Alright, but listen.
You remember that thing that you were supposed to do, right?
Yes.. I do.
Okay farewell.
I asked you to sleep. Tea will only drive your sleep away.
But tiredness was only an excuse to get tea.
I know all your ploys, since I've been seeing them from our childhood.
Here you are, have your tea.
What kind of tone are you talking with me?
The way you talked to me, do you remember?
When I came to your home with my husband.
I was your guest back then. Drink your tea!
Come sit here...
Don't sit here.
Why won't he drink tea? Serve it to him.
Tea...
Take it.
Brother Adeel you didn't eat anything. Take these biscuits.
Do you want me to serve you something?
Eat some cake, it's nice.
Zara likes to eat this.
Zara... my dear check on dinner.
Sure
Do you want my help?
Here is your tea.
Shaista.
I'm telling you, this girl is dangerous.
She's a firecracker ready to explode.
Why should we care if she's a firecracker or a bomb?
Her intentions aren't good. I'm telling you.
You've recognized her intentions two minutes into meeting her. Amazing!
I didn't meet her for two minutes, I was insulted for two minutes.
You didn't see how she was talking.
I don't assess anyone just by looking at them.
All I know that she is an ill-mannered girl.
I'm thinking of giving brother Manzoor the rent like we used to.
What? Have you gone insane? Why should we pay the rent?
If we're getting a chance to save money, then we should?
What about that girl insulting us?
How does that matter?
She's here as a guest and she'll leave soon.
You are the one who said that we shouldn't care.
We're saving money and we should keep it that way.
Respect doesn't matter. Some days you have it some days you don't.
It's a stupid thing to say that we should start paying the rent.
Adeel...
Adeel.
Zara.
What are you doing?
I came here to take your clothes for ironing. Which ones should I take?
What do you mean?
Ever since I came here, you've been asking me to eat, or rest.
And now you want to iron my clothes?
Why don't you ever ask me to sit and talk with you?
It doesn't seem nice.
Talking on the phone is different, here everyone watches.
Why doesn't it seem nice?
We are married, we're not strangers.
Still, it doesn't seem nice. Tell me... which clothes you'll wear.
I'll iron it... the electricity will go out soon.
What if I don't tell you?
Then I'll choose for myself.
Should I iron this?
Listen... I have something for you.
What?
Let me show you.
What is this?
What's this, you ask..
Let me show you.
How do you like it?
Very nice.
It looks even better on you.
What's going on here!
What do you mean?
I brought a gift for Zara and I was giving it to her.
You brought her a gift, but I don't see it.
Where is it? Or do you not want to show it to me?
It's not like that, Adeel gave me this locket.
He didn't just give it to you, he put it on you as well.
It's amazing to see how progressive you two have become.
When I got married...
I didn't talk to my husband in front of anyone for months!
But I think this is just about one's morals. I was very shy.
What tone are you taking with us?
What tone? What did I say?
Mother called me... I'll go and listen to her.
What did you do?
What was so wrong with me putting a locket on her?
What did I do? I was talking about myself. I didn't say anything to her.
I said that I was shy when it came to doing such things.
What did we do that you are trying to insinuate?
Wait Zara... where are you off to in such a hurry?
Where is the groom? I want to meet him as well.
Adeel is a little busy, you can see him later.
Oh hello! Let him know that he can't stay busy here.
It's not like we're free! I'll meet him myself.
Saad, you won't go in his room.
What happened?
Nothing, come with me.
Something did happen.
You seem upset. It's nothing.
I'm not upset.
Why are you asking the same question again and again?
What's your problem?
Something is up.
Did Adeel say something to you?
You know... that I can tell when you're lying.
Why do you lie to me then?
Now tell me, otherwise I'll ask Adeel.
Saad, I said that you won't go into his room.
You won't listen to me... come with me...
Let go of my hand Saad!
Tell me...
I went to Adeel's room to get his clothes.
He brought me a gift, this locket.
He was putting it on me and his sister saw me.
And she said some weird things.
Then I left.
Saad...
I've told you something serious and you're laughing.
You should have thought of that before being romantic.
Anyone could have walked in on you guys.
I didn't go there to be romantic. I went there to get his clothes.
And because of that you had to suffer the consequences.
Saad, for once can your try being serious?
You know that Mahi, she'll just exaggerate the story
She likes making mountains out of molehills.
Let her... what will you do? We're here.
Why are you worried?
Technically, Adeel should have taken a stance for you.
But he's scared of his sister.
I'm so worried and you're joking.
Talk about Adeel respectfully...
I will not tolerate anything disrespectful against him.
I'm just kidding... when have I ever been rude?
You should respect Adeel.
And listen...
What?
Forget it... there's no point.
Listen to me... Zara listen to me.
It's good, I caught you. If only I had asked for something else as well.
I need to run some errand, bring your motorcycle around.
Why don't you go yourself?
What do you mean? What are you doing here?
I'm sure you must be talking Zara. Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
If you're talking about respect and manners,
then tell me, what kind of manners teaches you to enter one's room without knocking?
You're calling me manner-less because of Sarah?
Your older sister.
No.
I didn't say that at all. I am just asking you what kind of manners these are.
You're being so rude to me and she hasn't even come to our home.
What will you do when she finally arrives.
I'm not saying this because of Zara, I'm saying it because of me.
You insulted Zara after you insulted me.
And please... stop this... we are at my in-laws home, what will they think?
So, what you're trying to say is that you are being embarrassed because of me.
I didn't say that at all.
Why do you always present things in your favor?
Enough, I've done as much as I could have.
I want to go home, buy my tickets.
What do you mean?
I'm telling you that you will not go anywhere.
I don't understand.... you've insulted me in front of her.
You humiliated me...
someday she'll argue with me... with mother... with father.
You've left me no respect in front of her.
Zara is not disrespectful to anyone.
If it were like this, then she would have surely answered you, but she left.
Alright fine... look at my hands. Forgive me.
I wasn't saying it about her... I was talking about how I used to get shy.
And if you still don't believe me, I'll go and apologize to her as well.
I'm not asking you to apologize.
Sister, please...
Look at me... I apologize to you on Zara's behalf.
No need for this.
There is no need to apologize. Get me my ticket. I'll go home today
You will not go anywhere. I will not get you tickets.
Fine.. I'll buy them.
That will not happen.
It will.
You embarrassed me in front of her.
Zaini... Zaini. Get up!
Zaini get up...
What is it? Let me sleep.
Zaini get up... I want to talk to you.
What is it, I'm listening.
Get up...
I'm listening... it's not like I'm dead.
Tell me, what is it? I'm listening.
Forget it... I don't want to talk to you.
Okay.
Thank you... please go.
Zara... how dare you!
She doesn't even let me sleep.
Zara's in-laws are so far away. She can't come here daily from Hyderabad.
If you are so wise... then why weren't you so wise when it came to you?
I mean... husband and wife fight with each other every other day.
You returned home in two days.
Mother, what can I say?
There was no respect. On the contrary she told me...
that Adeel had gifted her a locket.
Really... was the locket gold, or artificial?
What are you saying?
I just saw it... I didn't feel it to check if it was gold, silver, or artificial.
Whether it be gold or artificial, nowadays they are of the same price.
It seemed branded to me.
To hell with her!
She will sell my son!
Your son is no less.
She insulted me in front of her!
Not once did he think that I was his elder sister.
I begged in front of your son.
What?
What are you doing over there?
You made some bold claims before you left...
that you will return with good news, but you're apologizing in front of them.
What I did was right...
I did it so that Adeel takes my side, instead of Zara's.
You know what they say... it's easier to catch more flies with honey.
I don't understand. If he's so crazy in love with that girl...
then why would he care if you beg in front of him.
Leave that to me.
You have only one thing to do. Find a girl of lower status for Adeel.
So that she may always be under your thumb.
May God bless you.. you've made me very happy.
Tell me about your auntie.
Forget about her...
My main focus are Zara and Adeel. I'll deal with her later.
Listen, I'll talk to you later.
Let me check how Zara is exaggerating things.
You understand, right?
She will not say anything.
She will hide things... she's clever like her mother.
What will she say about what she was doing with Adeel in his room?
I will be the one to tell her that. Let me go and check.
Whatever you do, think before doing it. Understand?
They aren't engaged... they are married.
We don't want her sending her away here.
Will you be able to stop your father and brother?
Yes... I didn't think about that.
That's why I say...
think before you do something... otherwise, things might fall on your head.
I'm growing fearful of you.
No need to fear, I'll update you.
Listen, I'm reminding you, don't mention this to anyone.
We will regret it...
Alright, I understand.
Don't worry... it's my job to worry them. I'll talk to you later, farewell.
Farewell.
Looking at you, it doesn't seem that you've lived abroad for a long time.
Abroad everyone used to tell me that I didn't look like someone from Pakistan.
I become like the place I reside.
Then... when are you returning?
Why?
What does my return has to do with you?
You said that you were here for two months.
It's been two months, that's why I asked.
Your auntie loves me dearly...
It's hard to be away from someone when you love them.
You love Zara and won't it be hard for you when she leaves for Hyderabad?
What do you mean?
What does this have to do with Zara?
I know you two love each other and are good friend.
I've overheard you two on a few occasions.
Zara is only my friend.
There is no love between us.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm talking about the love that come with friendship.
I know there isn't anything between you two. It's just friendship.
Quickly finish this. I have to return.
Don't be so hasty... leave that man and his wife alone.
I have some work that I need to do.
Sit down... we'll leave as soon as this finishes.
Have some milk and jalebi.
You'll feel strong.
No?
I don't want to eat it.
Drink your tea then.
These kids came here alone.
If one of their parents had come, we would have sent her away.
Will they mind?
Maham's attitude seem very strange to be this time around.
This time around? She's always had a sharp tongue.
You don't understand what I'm saying.
Did she say something?
She doesn't need to. One's behavior can speak a lot.
Sister Faheeda didn't talk much as well.
She had never been one to speak much. That's not a big deal.
Look how happy Adeel is...
It won't matter if he's the only one who's happy.
It's something that the entire family should look forward to,
What's the matter? Are you hiding something from me? Did something happen?
I'm not hiding anything. I'm just saying...
It just seems strange to me.
Are you speaking the truth?
Have I ever lied to you?
Never hide anything from me when it comes to our girls.
My daughters are my strength.
Never try to make me weak by keeping me in the dark.
When it comes to children, women who hide things from their husband...
are inconsiderate towards their husband. 
I can never do that to you.
Then tell me, why did you say this?
I'm telling you... things seem weird to me...
It seems that Adeel forced her to come here. She's not happy.
You're thinking that for no good reason.
Whether its Maheen or Maham... both of them are the same.
They create problems out of thin air.
Why are you after Maheen?
 I've told you not to!
What do you mean? Think about it yourself...
Both of their names start with 'm' 
and I've decided that if ever a child is born in this family, their name won't start with 'm'.
What about you? What does your name start with Mr. Manzoor?
With an 'm'.
Yes!
What do you have to say now?
Always keep smiling like this.
You look very bad when you're rude...
No, I look very nice.
No...
Yes, I even look nice in a bad mood.
Where's Zara?
Why are you looking for her?
I wanted to drink tea.
But then I forgot Adeel has gone to a home where there is a wedding.
So Zara will not leave her room.
For your information...
Zara is out somewhere with Adeel.
A wedding?
It's possible she made an excuse to go somewhere else.
Why? Didn't Adeel tell you?
It's good... husband and wife should spend time together.
This will they'll get to know each other. Otherwise, small things can start fights.
Zara's in-laws live so far away. It's not like she can come here daily from Hyderabad.
If you are so wise, then why weren't you so smart when it came to you?
I mean, husband and wives with each almost every other day.
 Why did you come back home after two years?
Are you taunting me with divorce?
No, I'm just answering your taunt.
I couldn't let you leave empty handed... that would have been disappointing...
And I'm not one for disappointing guests.
Do you want tea, or will you wait for Zara?
No need.
Zara, I will not try to hide...
anything from you, or misguide you.
Sister Maheen is like this.
She likes bothering others.
But Adeel, don't you think it's your mistake?
I just came to your room with clothes.
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't stopped me.
Something would have happened.
Something would have happened... and this would have happened.
Come home with me.
We'll live a long with each other.
I want you to know this.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Does your family not like me?
Is this relationship against their wishes?
It's not like this?
Actually...
Ever since sister Maheen has been divorced..
I don't know what's happened to her.
She overreacts on everything.
You still haven't answered my questions?
Answer what I asked you.
I don't want you to ask me this.
Why?
Because I don't want to lie to you...
or break your heart.
Alright.
It's alright.
Zara...
All of this doesn't matter.
The truth is how happy we are with each other.
We are so close to each other and understand each other.
When a bond between a man and woman is strong... 
whether someone is with you or against you...
it doesn't matter.
Then promise me something...
What promise?
That you won't let a third person come between us.
We will not fight with each other because of someone else.
Maheen's example is in front of us.
Maheen has personal fight with her husband. 
They always fight with each other because of someone else.
I promise you...
you will never have any complaints against me.
I always stand with you.
And I never let anyone come between us.
I promise.
And yes...
I apologize to you on sister Maheen's behalf.
You are drifting away from your promise.
If we wont fight with each other because of someone else, 
then we won't be embarrassed in front of each other because of someone else either.
We won't apologize to each other as well.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Now let go of my hand.
You're still awake?
I'm about to go to sleep. You go ahead and sleep.
Does you family not like me?
Is this relationship against their will?
I don't want you to ask me this.
Because I don't want to lie to you...
or break your heart.
Go to sleep Zara... don't worry now.
I was about to go to sleep. Why are you still up?
I was awake to ask you why you haven't slept yet.
I expected that you won't be able to sleep today.
Goodnight.
