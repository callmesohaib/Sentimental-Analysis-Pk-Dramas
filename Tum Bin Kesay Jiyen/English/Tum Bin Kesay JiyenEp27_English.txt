Ali I didn't go in the kitchen myself and even if I did, isn't it my home as well?
Who told you it isn't your home?
What does it mean then? She came and said it directly to my face.
You know, its her habit.
Its not about habits Ali. Whats wrong is wrong.
She didn't let you cook. This doesn't mean she was showing you down.
Ali, its not about cooking.
Do one thing, tell Maheen, if she doesn't like me, she should at least tolerate me.
At least she can do that.
Dolly, you know Maheen's nature very well.
You're expecting protocol from her and she'll not give you that.
You should just stop thinking about it.
What is it? You're asking me and not your sister. Nobody says anything to her.
I didn't expect her.
See, its no use talking to Maheen
and I'm saying this because I've experienced it since childhood.
She will not change herself. This is why I'm asking you.
What do you mean she'll not change herself and you're asking me.
Who am I? What is my worth in this house, Ali?
However you are, you're my choice. Please stay like this always.
I'm telling you. If someone tells me that I misbehaved later, I'll not hear anyone
I know you'll not misbehave. Come on, have your food now.
More rice?
No I'll have a flatbread.
Zaini? Zara is expecting.
Really?
Yes. She just called mom.
This shouldn't have happened
What shouldn't have happened?
Zara shouldn't have been pregnant.
Please, don't start again.
Aren't you upset? Instead you have objections with me.
If I'm saying this, there should be a reason behind it.
What is the reason? Please tell me.
Now you'll see. They'll not let Zara come here. They'll keep her there.
And yes, it could be that they send her here after the child is born.
Forever and they keep the child too.
Where does all this get into your head?
Mom is absolutely right. You don't think before you speak.
Alright, don't trust me.
But when all this happens in front of your eyes, then I'll ask you.
Why don't you understand? They'll never let Zara stay there. You'll see.
As if she had lesser problems earlier that now she's expecting.
Whats wrong with you Adnan?
You're calling her child a problem?
No. I'm not calling the child a problem.
Its different for everyone. She has been widowed in such a young age.
Who will now marry her in this condition? Who will accept her?
Who told you she'll get married?
And it is important for her to get married?
God has blessed her with a child.
Why does she need to trouble herself with marriage?
What is the problem with your women? You don't understand anything. Listen to me with open ears.
We can spend our life with our children but not our youth.
We need a partner at every turn.
What sort of things do you say for girls like your own daughters?
How can someone say something like this. Its shameful.
You have no shame and you're saying whatever comes in your mind.
You mind think whatever I'm saying is nonsense but I'm not lying.
Mom.. Mom, I'm going home. I'll come back in the morning.
I'll come with you.
Mom, what will you do at home? Dolly is here as well. You stay too.
Then why are you going?
Mom, I couldn't sleep well for a few days. I want to go home.
Saad, what are you hiding from me?
There's something.
Tell me what is it. I'm watching. You've been silent for two days.
I feel you and Zaini are strained.
What happened between you two? Both of you are worried.
Its nothing. I don't know why you're feeling this. Everything is normal between us.
Not only me even Dolly is feeling this.
Mom, Dolly keeps saying stupid things.
Alright, I accept if you're saying nothing is wrong. But remember this.
If relationships are strained, the sooner you solve the problems, the better.
Do you understand?
Yes mom.
Mom, I'm leaving now.
Alright dear.
And if you need anything, let me know.
Alright. Take care of yourself. Bye.
Bye.
Mom, I feel anxious.
Dear, there's nothing to feel anxious about.
Why are you crying?
Even you're crying. Why are you crying?
I'm not crying. I just have flu. I'm very happy.
You've given such a good news.
You need to take care of yourself. Your dad has given the same message.
Mom, I miss Adeel very much.
He shouldn't have died. He should have been with me.
Are you listening, mom? Mom..
Yes my child.
I'm listening to you. Just stop crying now.
Yes and take care of yourself.
Yes.
Worrying in this condition is not good for you.
I'm here, I'll pray for you.
May God take care of you, my child..
I also told her, I'd listen to Aquib and stop talking to her.
I don't know whats wrong with her? She talks nonsense these days.
I've always found her this way.
That's why I don't like you being friends with her.
That's why I feel, she's jealous of us.
Not us, just you. What problem will she have with me?
I don't know. She said you were involved in the robbery in our house.
And you called me to open the door downstairs.
And then?
Yes. I told her to shut up. I told her that you called me to meet you.
Nothing more.
She kept repeating that Aquib was involved in this.
So what do you think? Should we make your friend believe this?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
I'm coming to your house to see you. Just one look.
What? Are you mad? Don't come at this time.
Now, I'll definitely come.
Your friend thinks I'm a fool.
So if she thinks you're a fool, will you be a fool and prove it to her?
What are you saying Aquib?
Mahi settled down with a lot of difficulty. If she finds out, it'll be a problem.
What if the problem is solved?
I told you not to come.
And I'm telling you I'll come.
Because of Sadaf?
No. Because of myself. I'm nearby. I'll be there in ten minutes.
Please, don't sleep. I'll text you. Come on the gate. Bye.
Aquib..
What should I do about him? He has gone crazy.
I thought I'd insult her and throw her out. But what happened?
but what happened?
All my game is destroyed.
She was dad's favorite first and now mom is impressed after her.
She seems to have forgotten everything and is looking after her now.
She has just found out now.
What will happen when this child is born?
No. I won't let this happen.
Mirha, where are you going at this hour?
No. Actually I,
was checking the door if it was closed or not.
Tell me the truth, what were you doing here.
I'm telling the truth. I was scared that's why I came here to check the door.
Looking at you, it seems you got scared when you saw me.
I cannot do anything about what you feel
Whose message is it?
Why are you asking?
Stay here.
Oh God. Why is Mahi always irritating me?
She's always playing detective. What if she tells anyone?
What were you doing?
I was offering prayers. What happened Mirha? Is everything alright? Are you okay?
I felt anxious so I came to your room.
If you don't have any problem, can I sleep with you tonight?
Of course. You can sleep. Its no problem.
Thank you.
You sit here. I'm going to perform ablution?
What did you think? I cannot come here?
Why did he come here? You called him again?
I...
Don't be loud. Zara will hear you.
Shut up and come in my room immediately.
You go. I'm coming.
Come to my room in 5 minutes.
Who was it Mirha? Who were you talking to?
It was Mahi. She wanted to talk.
Mahi was here? What did she say?
Nothing. You leave it. You know her. You'll not like it.
You offer your prayers, I'll make tea.
I wanted to have tea so we'll drink together now.
You're hiding something from me Mirha?
No. How can it be? How can I hide something from you?
You offer your prayers, I'll make tea.
Tell me what is it?
She said if I felt awkward, why didn't I go to her?
Why did I come to you?
Let it be. I told you, you wouldn't like it.
You offer your prayers, I'll bring tea.
Whatever you're hiding Mirha, nobody would like it when they hear about it.
I have to remind you.
You told me that there are problems in the house so I should remind you.
When your father passed away, it was Zara's birthday a few days later.
You brought cake for her and a gift.
Even if it was small, you celebrated her birthday.
You weren't even ashamed a little? Leave the thieves.
Your brother passed away a few days ago. You're not ashamed at all.
Why should I be ashamed? I just went to check the gate.
Really?
Who was on the bike who ran away as soon as he saw me?
How would I know who he was?
You should have stopped him and asked him who he was and why was he running away?
Shut up or I'll give you a slap now.
I'll go and tell dad right now.
Go ahead and tell anyone you like. Say whatever you like.
You've talked and Zara has heard as well.
Whatever it is, right or wrong, let everyone know. And what do you think?
Will Zara tell noting to her family? You didn't even think once before you blamed me?
what did she say?
She heard everything and I swore to her that whatever she heard was a lie
but why would she believe me?
What did she say?
Leave it be.
Why don't you tell me? What did she say?
And Mahi I swear I don't know who he was. I just went down to check the gate.
Why don't you tell me what Zara said?
She said that she thought we were very respectable and her mom and Maheen were right.
You got divorced because of this.
Shut up. Zara can never say that.
She would never say such a thing. It must be you.
If you don't believe me, then don. Why did you ask me if you didn't want to believe me?
You still believe her more than me. If so, go and ask her. What did she hear and what did she say?!
Alright.
I'll talk to her myself. You think about yourself.
What happened Farida?
You're crying.
I'm missing Adeel.
Be patient Fareeda.
We can do nothing except being patient?
I don't understand. What are God's secrets?
He took away my son and now I have good news of being a grandma.
I don't know, whether we should be happy or sad.
I told you Farida,
just be patient.
There is something better for us in everything God does.
We don't understand that.
Be patient.
I cannot be patient Ahmed. I cannot be patient anymore.
It is great that you came. We wanted to get medicines for mom. Please you take me now.
Tell me, I'll get it.
You don't know about her medicines. We'll go and come in half an hour.
I have to drop Zaini. You know I go everyday.
Yes, you go everyday. Take me today.
Wait for a while. I'll take you as soon as I get back after dropping Zaini.
As it is, the market won't be open yet.
Where do you want to go? Tell me. I'll take you.
I need to get mom's medicines.
Don't go anywhere. I'll take you myself when I come. Wait for a while.
What happened? I was finding a solution.
Saad minded it. Your wish.
Zaini is here. How are you?
Lets go.
Listen, where are you going? What did I tell you about Saad?
What did you say?
Zaini has complete control over Saad. Did you see his face that day?
She looked upset. As if she was angry.
Uncle, her face is like that. She's always angry.
Very good. You've become very funny. What is this?
I'm not joking. I'm serious. She is like this.
Learn something from Zaini. See how she has Saad following her everywhere. 
You do something like that and get Ali under your control. You're  a beautiful girl.
Don't worry Adnan uncle. I'll tell what I can do when time comes.
Good. I expect this from you and you'll fulfill my expectations.
 Did you call Zara?
No.
Why didn't you? You should call and congratulate her. 
You'll have to show off otherwise it won't work.
I'll do it later, whats the rush? I have to call Saad too.
Alright. What did you want to get from the market. I'll get it myself.
No. There's no need.
What do you mean you don't need anything? Why did you stop Saad? Without any reason?
I tried to stop him but he didn't need to stay.
 I'll just look into the kitchen.
Here is your breakfast?
Why did you make breakfast, aunt?
Oh, what happened? Can I not make breakfast for you?
I was just coming.
I slept late last night so I couldn't wake up on time.
Its alright. Sit and have breakfast.
It happens in this condition.. I know. You just need to rest.
Its important to rest in these days. 
And girls ask for a lot of pampering in such a condition.
Especially girls like today. In fact, not only girls today. Ask your mom..
I did so many dramas in my time. 
Of course I did. Why are you looking at me like this? Ask your mother.
God keep my mother in law in heaven, she didn't even let me stop down from the bed.
 I'll also pamper you and look after you.
Come on now. Have your breakfast. Eat your full. What are you thinking?
Eat your breakfast. Eat your full. Do you know?
I have also thought of a name for my grandchild.
 I'll name my grandson, Adeel.
I have faith it will be a son.
 I saw a pious man in my dream,
his hands were shining and he handed me a child wrapped in a white cloth.
 I know it was a boy.
You'll have a son and I'll name him Adeel.
Now you have your breakfast. 
I'll come in a while and check. You should have finished everything.
Bye.
Zaini, stop being angry. 
You didn't talk to me the entire way.
What would I tell you?
Anything you wanted. Did you ever ask me what to say earlier?
Earlier, things were different. 
Why do you object me not talking to you?
I'll come to pick you up.
We'll sit and talk somewhere.
Bye.
Irshad? Get the things.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Dear,
Did you call and tell your aunt?
I'll just tell her.
When will she come by?
She'll be here in a day or two.
A day or two? Alright. Its good.
We'll spend two more days peacefully.
Uncle..
You're...
I think your aunt heard us.
Alright. Its Ahmed's call. Hello? Yes.
Yes Ahmed, I was about to call you in a day or two. What? What did you say?
How? How did it happen? Oh..
Alright. Oh.. what can we say?
Yes. Sure. Yes. May God fix everything. Yes.
Oh, Zara what are you doing? You should have told me, I'd have set everything.
You're not well. You can tell me.
I'm absolutely fine Mahi, thank you.
No you're not okay. Tell me everything. I'll manage everything. 
Come on. Move now. Good girl.
Nothing is wrong with me, I'll do it.
I wanted to request something.
 Please help me.
Did you see I was upset with Mirha when she was in your room?
Yes.
Do you know what? 
Think if it had happened in front of Adeel. What would he have done?
I don't understand.
I am doubting Mirha.
 I think she met someone last night.
Whom?
A boy.  
See Zara promise me. This will stay between you and me. It'll not go out.
Mirha shouldn't know. Not your family. Not my family. 
Promise me you won't tell anyone. 
Do you know if Adeel was alive,
he would have done anything to save the respect of our house. 
You'll have to do that now.
Please talk to Mirha
 and ask her whats going on? 
Will you talk to her?
What should I ask Mirha?
Promise me you'll not tell anyone. 
You know Mirha takes me as her enemy.
I told her lovingly that she should make me meet that boy. I'd meet him and talk to him.
She didn't agree. 
She's close to you and she listens to you. Get things out of her.
Ask her whats going on? In fact I'd say you should meet that boy.
Mahi, I'm not meeting anyone.
I didn't mean that. Don't meet him. Whose asking you to meet? 
But you can at least talk.
I know she'll share everything with you. 
Please don't say no. 
Had Adeel been alive, he'd have done the same thing.
But now since he's not here, you're in his place. 
You have to handle everything.
Promise me. You'll talk to her. Please.
Thank you. 
Should I help?
No I'll do it.
Its alright. I'll do it. 
Thank you Zara.
You didn't answer me.
About what?
As if you don't know. I told you to come back from Islamabad. Forever.
Dolly, it isn't important..
It isn't important that you always say no to me.
When did I always say no?
I've never tried to make you agree. 
I keep asking you to come back but you say no.
Can I know the reason?
As if you don't know.
Dad says the same thing. I should live here.
Alright. So, you'll listen to your dad and not me.
I'm asking you something Ali.
Dolly you know the answer.
Really? Should I tell mom?
Right away?
Of course, I need witnesses. What if you say no tomorrow? I don't trust you.
I promise you. This time, I'm going to Islamabad for the last time.
Promise?
Promise.
Good decision.
