What do you want to do about this?
Do you want me to humiliate Aqib by introducing him to them?
You know how Mahi is... she's say whatever comes to mind to him.
She's already labeled him as a thief.
What will she do when she meets him?
I was thinking what would have happened if she hadn't gone with Usama.
Maybe it would have been the last time she met Usama.
what are you saying?
Would we have made our daughter stay at home for the rest of her life?
What else?
Why are you getting worried? I will not tell anyone anything, you know how I am.
My dear, your uncle Adnan is with you. Why are you getting worried?
I'm here.
What trouble do I find myself in?
If she asks someone then I won't be able to stay in this house for a second.
And Saad... he will kill me.
Of course.
Come here my dear child. You are the peace of our eyes.
Come Zaviar... look at the surprise we've brought you.
What is all this?
These are sweetmeats.
Since your marriage has been finalized...
you aunt has decided to distribute sweetmeats in the neighborhood and your in-laws.
We'll start with you in-laws first.
Yes...
What is the matter Zaviyar? Are you not happy?
Zaviar, what's the matter?
Uncle we have a problem.
What problem?
I cannot marry right now.
My son, you're the one who agreed to this.
Why are you refusing now? Did brother Ahmed say something?
No, it's not like that.
I like Mahi and I've convinced auntie as well.
Then what's the problem?
Uncle, I want to shift my business to Lahore.
It's getting hard for me to manage things in Lahore and Hyderabad.
You know how things are at the factory.
It's important for me to be there. Until the business is settled in Lahore properly...
Mr. Tahir will be able to handle it but no one is working there properly.
It was hard for me to settle this business and I don't want to lose it at any cost.
If you could ask Mr. Ahmed to marry me to Mahi,
I could take her with me to Lahore.
Hmm... I understand what your problem is.
But, they will not agree on such short notice.
Then you should talk to them. They are your old friends. Try convincing them.
Friends should come to your aid in times of need. Ask them to come to a compromise.
Look, it's not that easy. After their son's death...
it would be hard for them to forget and marry their daughter.
You are right Mr. Alam, I'm not asking for a huge commotion.
I can realize what they feel.
Alright, if you say so...
I'll try...
I want a simple marriage uncle.
But at least talk to them.
Alright my son. I'll try.
But if they choose to refuse.
Then what?
Try talking to them, if they do not agree, we'll think of something else.
As you wish.
Improve your mood. Don't worry, everything will be alright.
Why have you decided to leave? Is it something that we did?
No brother, it's not like that...
Actually it's my daughter's in-laws and we stayed here for quite a few days. We would like to leave now.
Sister Asfa, when I talked to you yesterday you said that you would leave once Ali leaves.
Then why all of a sudden?
That's what I planned...
But I got sick... I didn't tell you because I didn't want to worry you.
Sister you should have told me, I would have asked Ali to take you to the hospital.
No brother it isn't like that. Thank God I'm fine now.
Please allow us to leave now.
It would have been great for a few more days.
Maheen has returned home as well.
He'll leave for work. Only Zaini and I will be left and I feel very anxious.
Please don't worry.
You can call Dolly whenever you want. She's your daughter.
Alright, whatever you think is best. How will you guys go?
Is Saad coming?
Brother is out running errands.
I'll call a cab.
No need for that. Ali will drop you guys. Ali take them please.
Sure father.
My dear, bring my bag and my medicine.
Sure mother.
I will call you when I'm worried. Please send Dolly.
Why are you worrying?
I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you. You have helped us in our times of need.
Be strong. This is God's will.
Zara... here you are my dear. Have breakfast.
I'm not hungry auntie.
Zara... how are you not hungry? You have to eat.
When my grandchild comes into this world, I'll take good care of him.
I will love him. I will never let him be away from me.
What if it's a daughter?
What are you saying?
Don't say such things. Prayers can get accepted at any moment now.
Be careful...
a women has a lot of things to worry about under your condition. So avoid saying such things.
The most beautiful feeling for a women is to become a mother.
It makes no difference to her if it's a boy or a girl.
A mother's love doesn't distinguish.
No need to think of such things.
Just think that, God willing, you'll have a son.
And I'm sure you'll have a son and I'll name him Adeel.
Don't say such things again. Now have breakfast.
Listen to me Dolly.
Did you have something for me?
Yes...
It's nothing... carry on.
Uncle Adnan, if there's something, I can do it.
No there isn't. Besides, I think Ali was calling you.
Alright, farewell.
Go.
What's the matter? What were you going to say to her?
What happened to you all of a sudden?
You have never been afraid of your wife.
Nor do you care about any relationship.
What are you saying?
How should I make you understand? It's nothing like that.
She calls me uncle, but you don't understand.
Alright.
I'll believe you.
Thank God.
I'll trust you blindly one more time.
But you'll have to listen to me as well.
What?
You'll have to come with me.
Where?
Your ice cream is melting. No worries, you can eat mine.
It's been a while since we've met.
What can we do, this cruel society has build a wall between us.
Then break down this wall.
Really... I'll break it down at your will.
Don't say such dramatic things.
It's called being romantic, not dramatic.
You think this is a joke. Do you know how hard it was for me to meet you?
Why? Who was stopping you?
Who else than Mahi?
She's made my home into check post.
She keeps an eye on everyone that comes and goes.
How did she let you come today?
I took permission from father, telling him that I had an extra class.
I thought your sister wanted to meet me, so what's the problem?
She doesn't want to meet you. She's asked sister Zara to meet you now.
So what? I'll meet her as well. Ihave no problem meeting your sister-in-law.
When are we meeting then?
Let sister decided first, only then you can meet her.
Do you think she'll agree to meeting me?
Even if she doesn't, Mahi knows how to convince people.
Alright fine, do as Mahi says.
Why are you getting worried? It's good that your sister-in-law wants to meet me.
She'll relax once she discusses things with me.
This way it will be easy between you and me.
Try and understand...
Aqib, do you really want to marry me?
Do you still doubt it?
I truly love you Mirha.
I can give my life for you.
Don't say such things, I want to spend my entire life with you.
Then you have to trust me blindly, because there are no questions in love.
There is only love. Now eat your ice cream, it's melting.
You have to eat this one as well.
One is enough. Beside this one has melted.
That is what Mahi said?
Yes Saad. Mahi wants me to meet that guy.
She wants me to tell him to send his parents if he likes Mirha.
Why doesn't she meet him herself?
It's her sister's issue she should resolve it herself.
Mirha is afraid of Mahi
That's why she didn't tell anyone at home. Only me.
I don't understand how come Mahi is silent up till now.
I don't know what do as well.
She's depending on me to take a stand for Mirha.
This is not simple. I think you should talk to uncle Ahmed.
Saad I told Mahi... but she wants me to meet that man first.
Has she gone insane?
You are in your waiting period, how can you meet a strange man?
Your mother-in-law didn't even let you meet me.
Do you remember the scene she created?
Forget everything Saad... I've forgotten everything as well.
Life has put me through so many tests that I don't fear anything now.
Since when did you start talking like this?
I've always seen you battling your situation.
Since when have you started taking orders?
Hello... Zara... hello?
Hello... hello... Saad.
Who were you talking to?
I was talking to Saad.
Why did you hang up then?
I didn't hangup, the line disconnected.
Tell me something, doesn't Saad work?
I mean he's on the phone with you all the time.
Saad wanted to talk to me about something.
Do you guys talk about everything?
Did you have something for me?
I wanted to talk to you.
What is it?
Mirha has gone to meet that boy again today.
Did Mirha tell you?
Why would she?
She's not  my friend, she's your friend. I'm sure she told you.
No Mirha didn't say anything like that to me.
Didn't she tell you?
No she didn't, otherwise I would have stopped her from going.
I'll talk to Mirha...
Listen to me, where are you going?
I asked you to meet that guy, but you didn't listen to me.
Now she's meeting that guy in secret.
I don't want to meet that guy.
Why not?
Why are you forcing me?
What is your problem? Why don't you want to meet that guy?
I don't want to meet him. If you try to force me again, I'll tell uncle everything.
I know everything.
The way she refused, I'm sure Saad asked her to say this.
Otherwise she would never have refused me.
What you didn't wasn't right Zara.
I was the one who started this game.
And I'll be one to end this game.
Not you.
I would not let you escape this game so easily.
Mother...
Come here my dear. I'm in your room.
Greetings*
You look very happy.
What are you hiding at the back?
Your prayers have worked. I'm about to be very successful.
Why are you speaking in riddles? Tell me, what is it?
The thing is...
that I've been hired.
Really... thank God!
Look, I've brought sweetmeats for you.
Let me feed it to you first.
Here you are.
You have one as well.
May God bless my son with success.
Mother, are you crying?
My dear, these are tears of joy. I'm happy at my son's success.
Mother, I promise that I will work very hard.
I will never let tears come to your heart.
I know my son is very hardworking.
What is going on here?
Eat some sweetmeats. Your brother has found himself a job.
Really... here you are.
Have something sweet.
When was the interview, you didn't tell me about it.
If I had told you then how would I have given you this surprise.
And how would I have been able to see this happiness on my mother's face.
Bless you. I pray that God gives you success.
Amen*
Shall I serve lunch?
Yes, after that I'll head on to Zara's home to give Zaini these sweetmeats.
Sure... freshen up.
Take this... don't eat all of them
What's the matter? What are you thinking?
I was thinking... are we important to brother or them?
Stop thinking such things and come on.
I've announced my decision to everyone. I can't live without Aqib...
I can't think of leaving.
Mirha please...
Sister please... if you can't help me, then don't interfere in my business.
Mirha!
Why have you brought me here?
I told you that you won't ask me any question.
I promised, but that doesn't mean that you can take me anywhere.
Just once come inside with me.
I won't go inside
Adnan... come inside. You'll fall in love with the kids inside.
Are you insane? We don't know who their parents are and you've brought me here.
What are you saying? Think before you speak.
It's possible that God brought them into this world so that people like us can adopt them.
I want to adopt a kid so that I can be a mother.
Are you insane? You want to adopt a kid! Leave with me at once!
I will not go...
Stop creating a scene... and come with me.
Are you trying to find someone?
No we are not. Are you coming or not?
I will not go.
Come with me.
Listen to me.
Why aren't you picking up my calls?
I was studying.
Enough studying...
Saad, my exams are about to start, what's the matter with you?
Your real test is about to start with me.
 focus on that, that's more important.
Why would you care about what's important for me?
Are you still upset with me?
Did you have something for me?
I did... I wanted to tell you something, but forget it.
Wait... tell me what's the good news.
I will not tell you. For you, your ego is more important than me.
Are you telling me or not.
On one condition. You will promise that you stop being upset with me.
First tell me the news...
The news is that I've been hired.
Really... yes... I've been hired.
Congratulation!
You'll have to come with me.
Where?
It's a surprise.
Still tell me, where...
I'm waiting for you...
Come on...
Umm... alright.
What's the matter?
Mirha, where were you?
I had a class.
You're lying. 
I know you went to meet that guy.
Sister, what's the matter with you?
What you're doing is wrong. 
You have no relationship with that guy.
You are betraying you family and you're not doing right by yourself.
Then tell me if you have a way.
It's better to know the path you are walking before you walk it.
If you jump without thinking... then you fall off a cliff as well.
Sister... one learns when when falls.
 You and brother Adeel had your fair share of problems as well.
Mirha... life isn't a competition.
One has to think before making decisions.
Then do it, who's stopping you from making decisions?
You're the one who's delaying the decision. I've announced my decision to everyone.
I can't live without Aqib and I can't even think about leaving him,
Mirha please...
Sister please... if you can't do anything about me, then no need to interfere in my business.
Mirha...
How are you?
I'm well, thanks to God.
I'm perfectly fine.
You went through the trouble of coming here. You could have visited me at home.
I'll will visit you soon.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Sure what is it?
We like your daughter Mahi for my nephew Zaviar.
It's been a while since I heard good news.
You will be getting even better news in the future.
If God is willing.
Joining a relationship with an honorable family like yours...
has made me very happy... believe me...
Anyone I've asked about you has testified about your honor.
Brother Noor Alam God is the one who assigns respect
Otherwise we sinners have no power over this.
A man doesn't have power over anything,
Of course, you are right.
May God keep it this way and bless our children...
with happiness.
Amen*
Mr. Ahmed... I had a request...
If you don't mind.
What are you saying? Please speak your mind.
Of course... thank you.
Actually I didn't want to be so hasty in telling you this news, but what can I do...
I am compelled by something.
Please speak openly...
Mr. Ahmed...
The thing is that...
Greetings*
Where are you two coming from?
What's the matter Shaista? Why are you crying?
I took him to an orphanage to adopt a child
But he refused... how is it my fault that God has deprived me of this blessing?
I want to become a mother as well. I want there to be a child in my home.
A child that would call me mother. But he refused, and humiliated me there.
Enough... forget this for now if he's not listening to you.
With time he might understand. Don't cry.
These things are supposed to be left to God.
Be patient my child.
What are you saying? A marriage ceremony in a week?
How can this be possible?
This is what they want.
Make them understand then.
I've asked them some time to answer them back.
There is nothing to think about.
This marriage is not possible. We don't accept their proposal. Refuse it!
Look, decisions made in haste are detrimental.
Ask this yourself, is what they're asking normal?
Marriage aren't supposed to be done so quickly.
Why not... Adeel's marriage was done like this as well.
Come my dear... sit with us.
I'll come back later uncle.
No my dear, you are part of this house.
And it's important for you to be part of this discussion.
Tell me Zara... how can the marriage be done so quickly?
 They are forcing their decision on us.
What should we do then? If we refuse then the proposal won't last.
It is a good proposal, what will you do if we lose it?
There is nothing wrong with my daughter. 
We'll find a million proposals for my daughter.
Alright you will... but what if they put the same condition forth?
You just need an excuse to contradict me.
Zara, am I wrong?
I don't want things to be done in haste. But we have to look at their compulsion.
Uncle, whatever decision you and auntie make will be the best for Mahi.
Fareeda try to understand.
Why don't you understand?
 Not much time has passed since Adeel's demise.
Why don't they understand this?
They are compelled.
Then we are compelled too.
Alright. I'll refuse. I'll ask them if they can extend the date, otherwise...
we refuse.
Uncle, please don't refuse.
Do what they're asking you to do?
Zara, what are you saying?
Auntie, Mahi will find a lot of guys, by a diamond is one in a million.
They are good and honorable people.
 The best thing is that both of them understand each other.
We shouldn't refuse this relationship. 
If you're worried about me, then don't be
I will have no objections. I'm sure...
if it were Adeel in my place he would have wanted Mahi to be happy.
So please, don't refuse this proposal. 
Call them and accept their proposal. Prepare for the marriage ceremony.
Sure my dear... bless you.
You forgot me as soon as you left. I was waiting for your call.
It is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Do you think that I'm not fond of you?
Why would I think that?
Then why didn't you call?
Ali I was busy.
You were busy?
Where were you busy? May I ask?
Why should I tell you?
Why would you tell me? Alright, I don't want to talk to you as well.
Alright...
Ali...
Ali... hello...
See... look how you got worried. It only took you two seconds.
What kind of childish behavior is this?
What about what you're doing?
Will you take revenge from me?
I will, if you give someone other than me, your time.
What are you saying? I was busy with mother when we returned home.
Brother Saad was just hired. 
Mother made food and asked me to have it distributed in the mosque.
That's what I was doing.
That's great news. I'll ask Saad for a treat.
There is no need to steal from my brother.
I have a separate bond with your brother and a treat is in order.
Listen, I will talk to mother and father tomorrow.
About what?
About our marriage.
But Ali... what will you do say if they ask the reason for your haste?
Leave that to me. I'll handle everything. No one will ask you anything.
Okay... farewell.
What are you thinking?
Fareeda...
What are you thinking?
I miss Adeel.
If he was here today, he would have been so happy.
Why are you silent?
Don't you miss him?
Not only mothers have the right to miss their children.
I'm Adeel's father.
I miss him very dearly.
Then why don't you talk about him with me?
I think...
if I keep reminding you of him...
then you will never be able to forget him.
Who can forget their child?
I miss him all the time.
Do you know... whenever I see Zara...
it reminds me of Adeel.
Let me tell you one thing...
I will never let Zara go away from here. I will always keep her here.
Yes... if only you would have thought of that before.
You're right.
I was blind.
I...
I couldn't recognize Zara's goodness.
When she talked about Mahi today...
I was surprised.
She...
For Mahi, she chose Mahi's happiness over her sadness.
Do you understand what I'm saying.
I do understand... and I can see that you're changing slowly.
I used to tell you that Zara's heart is pure.
She doesn't have hatred for anyone.
Yes.
I was the one who didn't understand her.
If only I...
accepted Zara as Adeel's wife.
If I had my son would have left this world happy.
He was upset with me when he left, right Ahmed?
He was upset with me when he left.
You know that Adeel could never stay upset with you for long.
You know that, right?
Then by God's will, wherever he is...
he must be smiling upon you.
Yes.
