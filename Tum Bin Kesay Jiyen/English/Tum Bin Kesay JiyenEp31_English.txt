Do you know when my grandson comes into this world I'll take good care of him.
I will love him loads,
I will never let him be away from me.
What if it is a daughter?
What are you saying?
Mirha went to meet that guy again today.
Did Mirha tell you this?
Why would she tell me?
She's your friend not mine. I'm sure she must have told you.
No, Mirha didn't talk to me about this.
I've already announced my decision.
I cannot live without Aqib and I can't even think of leaving him.
Mirha...
Sister please.
If you can't do anything from me, then there's no need to interfere in my matters.
What's the matter?
I think something went in my eye.
Show me.
Open you eyes and look up.
Is it fine now?
What are you looking at?
Your eyes.
Have you never seen them before?
You never let me and today I have an opportunity to look at them.
What's the matter now?
Nothing.
Look at me.
Smile... just like that.
Zaini... I know that you always complain that I never express myself.
It's because I don't know how to.
But I want to try.
Zaini there is only you in my heart.
Zara might have a hand in making you a part of my life..
but you're the one who made her place in my heart.
I never realized that...
you are the one who made me realize that love shouldn't be restricted to oneself.
Rather, it is something that is shared between two people..
I love you Zaini.
Will you have faith in my love?
Tell me, will you?
That's for you.
Thank you so much.
So beautiful, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
You look beautiful.
Uh... this is really very pretty.
Thank you.
Are you happy now?
Very much so.
Are you sure?
No more complaints?
What need was there for father to take advice from Zara?
What's your problem with this now?
The problem is with you and father. First it was only father...
but now you have started as well. You tell her everything.
So what if we took her advice?
She will tell her entire family now.
If family doesn't tell their family, they are bound to found out about it one way or another.
Rather, your father will tell your aunt today.
Stop father.
What do you mean? Have you gone insane?
Should we marry you in secret?
I thought this was going to be a simple wedding. So what's all the fuss about?
Don't speak nonsense in front of me
Besides don't you know that your father can't live without...
telling his sister. Keep that in mind, this will not remain a secret.
Why are you getting angry? What's the matter with you?
This will make no difference anymore.
I know why you are doing this, it's because you hate Zara.
Understand one thing Mahi, Zara is not like we thought her to be.
What didn't you do to her?
If she wanted she could have been stubborn and not let this wedding take place.
But she didn't do that.
You should clear your heart as well.
She hasn't told anyone about this at her home.
Try and be happy and stop this.
Cool your anger and have breakfast.
Mahi.
My God!
Maheen, I'm running late, could you please make me breakfast quickly.
Sure I'll make it.
Usama... Usama...
Yes mother?
Teach your wife respect. She didn't even greet me.
Alright... mother...
Here's money for the household expenses. I forgot to give it to you last night.
But son, this is not that much.
I gave some to Maheen as well.
Alright.
Tell me something... did she talk about separating your home?
No mother she didn't. I'm running late, let me have breakfast.
Alright.
How do I look?
Hmm... you do look nice.
Make sure no one gazes at your for long.
But I want you to gaze at me.
Saad, try being serious for once.
Why... do you think this is a joke?
Aren't you running late now?
I'll go then and how will you go to university.
I'm off today.
What about tomorrow?
Should I come to pick you up. I'll drop you on the way.
No, I'll manage.
Alright fine. I'll visit you on my way back.
Okay.
Farewell*
I thought you liked this job.
You worked hard for it. I even asked you to move here, but you didn't.
But why this now?
Father I can find a job here as well.
I don't want to live there anymore.
Alright.
I've never stopped you in the past, nor will I now.
But it's not wise to take decisions so suddenly.
Your father is right. Think about it once more. It's not easy to find a job.
Mother I've thought about this. I want to live with you all.
As you wish.
Thank you father.
Father, one more thing.
Sure...
I know that this isn't the time to talk about this...
It's possible that you might get upset with me as well.
Whatever it is say it openly.
Is it possible that...
you have me and Dolly married.
What?
What are you saying? Are you in your senses? Where did this come from all of a sudden?
Take it easy. Let me talk to him.
Have you seen the state of your sister.
How can you get married?
You're his only brother. How can you even think of being so careless.
Do you even realize what your sister is going through?
Are you just concerned with your happiness?
It's not like that, you have it wrong. Zara is not separate from me.
I know how she feels.
Alright then, be patient for a while. We'll think about this later.
Did Dolly ask you of this?
No mother, she didn't say anything.
Even if she did, there's nothing wrong with it. Zara mentioned her marriage as well
Things were different back then, we were compelled.
Then think that I'm compelled as well. Otherwise I would not have asked you of this.
You know how important Zara is for me.
What are you so compelled by then?
Why are you not ready to hear us out?
What happened?
You don't know what's going on in that home.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Maheen raised her hand on Dolly.
Without any reason.
What should I do in this?
That poor girl comes here to care for you two.
She's the daughter-in-law of this house and she acts that way by taking care of you all.
Sister Maheen... I can't believe it
That's why I wanted to talk to you about this.
That's why Dolly and her mother left that so suddenly.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Dolly didn't want to tell anyone this.
This is not something small.
You should have at least told your mother or me.
I told you not to cut that girl slack, look what happened now because of it.
That's why sister Maheen agreed to returning with brother Usama.
If she was here everyone would have known.
I didn't expect this from Maheen.
Dolly is our daughter-in-law and she shouldn't have been treated that way.
Sarwat you should have kept an eye on Maheen at least.
If I had known I would have taken her to her in-laws.
She has embarrassed us in front of everyone.
That's why I want you to make a decision.
Otherwise sister Maheen has told that Dolly that she won't let this marriage happen.
Who is she to decide this? Your parents are still alive.
Give me some time to think.
Alright father. I'll do as you say.
I know that you will be just to everyone.
Whatever you decide will be better for everyone.
What have you decided then?
I don't understand anything.
If you want, do you want me to talk to my brother?
Mother has invited me home.
Is everything alright?
I don't know, I'll know that once I go.
Can you pick me up?
No I have an important meeting. You can go yourself, I'll pick you up.
Sure, farewell.
Where are you going?
To my mother's home.
Why?
I don't know... I'll know that once I go there.
Who will do the housework?
Shela and Savera are here. They'll take care of it.
They always do. But this house is your responsibility
and you should look after it as I have.
Go wherever you want, but before that cook lunch.
You always have somewhere to go.
How will all of this happen so quickly.
It will, don't worry.
Zaviar has stated that he will look after all the arrangements.
I pray that everything goes well for our daughter this time.
Amen. God willing, that's how it will happen.
Last time Mahi was not at fault. That guy couldn't take care of our daughter.
Forget about what happened and thank God that we have found honorable people this time.
Otherwise who sends a proposal for a divorcee?
This way we'll get another chance to see a happy occasion.
They were the ones who initiated a proposal.
Of course...
You're right.
Sarwat is calling.
Greetings.
Yes everything is well... we are considering a proposal for Mahi.
If anyone from our family tells them...
that you are divorced.
No one is that bold.
Just ask Zara to keep her mouth shut.
Did you talk to him?
Yes.
What did he tell you?
I didn't ask.
But you called for advice didn't you?
They are talking about Mahi's wedding there.
Mahi's wedding.
They've received a proposal and the groom's family want the wedding done on Friday.
Really... what did you decide then?
They've decided to do a simple wedding ceremony.
Did you talk about Zara?
Brother told me that sister wasn't agreeing to it when they asked for date so soon.
Zara was the one who convinced her.
Zara is very smart. She has made everyone like her there.
I was thinking that they shouldn't have any objections if we announce to get Ali and Dolly married.
They shouldn't, this way Zara will come visit.
What's the matter? What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking how helpless of a father I am.
I've finding excuses to invite my daughter here.
You agree to listening to Ali, right?
Maheen...
didn't leave my any way as well.
Once Mahi is married.
Maheen has embarrassed me.
I don't know how I will be able to look sister Asma in the eye
I've called her here today. Once she's here I'll give her a piece of my mind.
Let's go and pray.
Sure, let's go.
What's the matter? Why the long face?
We shouldn't have hidden something like this from your father.
If your father finds out...
What thing?
About your divorce.
I told him that when they were here you told the guy yourself.
So what now?
He was asking again and I had to lie again.
That's not a big deal, it's not the first time you lied.
Quiet!
I lied on your say so. I've asked him not to mention it to anyone.
What can we do about you hiding this now?
This is not something trivial.
Mother, you are making me afraid.
I'm also afraid.
If anyone from our extended family tells them...
that you are married.
No one is that bold.
Just ask Zara to keep her mouth shut. Look at this...
How does this dress look?
It's good.
This is the one I'll wear.
There was one more... this one.
Yes, this one's good too.
And you guys believed her?
First answer me, did you raise your hand on her?
Mother... I was in anger... I didn't raise my hand on purpose.
We are the ones who gave you slack....
We have given you a lot of freedom.
Do you want me to beg, cry and apologize to her!
Your tongue is so sharp.
This doesn't happen in honorable families.
Tell me something. You listened to your son...
Why did he take his fiance's side without listening to his sister?
He should have at least asked my what made me so angry.
It makes no difference as to what made you angry.
Don't we know you?
This was wrong in every way!
Your father is very upset at you.
Dolly is exaggerating this.
Enough! Silence! If you don't want your...
father to be strict with you so stay away from the matters of this home.
Your father is still alive to look after the matters of this house!
Leave it to him. What's your problem?
Always ready to fight.
My dear child, this doesn't happen in an honorable household.
This was wrong in every way.
Your father is very upset at you as well.
If you want your father to not be strict with you then stay away from the matters of this house.
Your father is still alive to look after the matters of this house.
Leave it to him. What's your problem?
Father is calling you.
Father...
You called me?
Maheen I've always ignored all your mistakes because you were my eldest daughter
Because I think daughters have more right over their parents than sons.
No matter how much importance is given to sons in this society...
but in this world I've always given importance to my daughters.
But I didn't realize that this would embarrass me in front of the world one day.
Father...
Keep quiet!
No explanation can justify what you did.
If you want this house to stay open to you then you'll have to apologize to Dolly.
Hello...
Where are you? I've been calling you for ages.
I did message you. Father called me and I was with him.
I know... but it's been two hours since that.
You know that if I don't talk to you every five minutes...
I feel weird.
Oh Aqib
Father wanted to talk about something important so he called everyone.
That's what took so long.
Something important? Is everything alright?
Does your father know about  me?
No it's not like that. There was a proposal for my sister.
And they want to do the wedding ceremony this Friday.
That's what we were talking about.
Alright... this calls for a treat.
Why not? Sure... since sister will be leave soon...
there will be no one stopping us from talking to each, seeing each other...
I'm so happy Aqib.
After that...
we will try to convince our families.
What were you saying?
Father... you can make me do anything but...
don't say this. I will not apologize to her.
Enough!
Enough! I've tolerated you insolence too long, but not anymore!
Dolly will soon be the daughter-in-law of this house!
She is the daughter of my dead friend.
How will I look him in the eye during the day of judgment?
I promised my friend that I will always be there for his children.
But you have embarrassed me.
You wasted all my hard work. You broke my pride.
I didn't do anything.
She was being rude... I didn't do it on purpose.
You should have silenced yourself then.
What need was there to raise your hand?
Elder sisters are supposed to be like mothers.
If people younger than you are being rude then it's your duty to make them realize their mistake.
But the path you chose was wrong.
Did you think that she was only your sister-in-law?
She is also Zaini's soon to be sister-in-law.
Do you realize the difficulties you could have created for her?
She doesn't care about any relationship.
Mother and father you are being unjust.
I left that day because I didn't want things to be hard for you two.
Yes my dear... I thought that too.
I was under the impression that you went home because you couldn't your father being helpless.
But no, I was wrong. You went there to hide your mistake.
Father...
Enough.
Enough...
My head has bowed down in shame.
I cannot tolerate anymore embarrassment.
Maheen...
You will have to apologize to Dolly.
You have no other option.
Do you understand?
Father...
Hello...
Greetings*
Who is this?
It's be Zaviar.
You?
Yes.
How did you get my number?
It's not hard to get someone's number.
That's true... the person you took my number, what must they think about us?
Don't worry, she won't think anything like that. Farah gave me your number.
Oh... you are quite good friends with Farah.
Yes, we're of the same age...
We have been good friend since we were kids.
I'm sure you're good friends with your sister as well.
Of course.
What have you decided then?
About what?
What are you wearing to the wedding?
I've looked a few things, but I haven't finalized it.
Really... what if I want to send you something? Would you mind?
Pardon?
Tell me.
No... you can.
Alright then. I'll select a dress and have it sent to you today.
Mother has called sister Maheen home.
Then you should have been present there Ali.
I don't want to talk to sister Maheen.
 I talked to her as much as I could.
Ali you know sister Maheen. She won't like this.
Let her.
This is nothing compared to the way she insulted you.
Thank you.
For what?
For understanding me and taking a stand for me
Look Dolly I know that you can never be wrong...
That's why I took a stand for you. I hope you aren't upset at my anymore.
I wasn't upset at you before, I was just upset overall.
Do you know that you get upset in such an innocent manner.
When's your flight?
Tomorrow morning.
When will you return?
Next month.
After so many days?
It's my job, I can only come back after I fulfill my formalities.
Ali, is what we're doing okay?
Why would you think otherwise?
I don't know... did you talk to Zara?
I called her, her phone was off... I'll try again.
We need to tell her as well.
Will you eat lunch?
Sure, if you made it.
I'll be right back.
Shela... why are you wearing Maheen's suit?
So what if I wore it?
What do you mean?
You know she doesn't like this. You've fought with her on this before.
Let there be another fight... what's with you?
Forget your anger..
and look how lovely it looks on me.
Shela...
You have no shortage of clothes. Take off her clothes!
Mother what's so wrong? I'll change after I take a few pictures.
What if she comes back before you're done?
What do you want there to be a fight?
Are you afraid of her?
Why would I be afraid? Then let her see that I'm wearing her suit.
You will not change... look at who's at the door... go...
It's brother.
Greetings*
Why didn't you bring Maheen along?
She stayed at her mother's.
She stayed?
And we're waiting for her here?
Did you have something for her?
This is her home.
It's not good for her to go to her mother's house so often.
You should talk to her.
What should I talk to her about? She never sits down with us.
She doesn't leave her home.
This is Maheen's dress, right?
I liked it so...
Go and change...
Alright!
Mother ask her not to wear Maheen's clothes. She doesn't like it.
Alright, I will make her understand. 
You shouldn't have let her stay there. She stays there so regularly!
