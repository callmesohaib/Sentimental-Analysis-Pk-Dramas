How is the food?
I'll tell you but you take this from my hand first.
You've made such delicious food that I'm overjoyed.
My taste buds have died after eating such pathetic food at home.
If this is the case, why don't you come and live here with me?
Where will I go if I leave?
I don't understand. You praise her so much and yet you're upset with her.
If you're giving me such good food, why are you discussing nonsense things.
Alright I won't. But tell me where were you lost since so many days?
You didn't even ask after me.
I've started a new business out of town.
I had been a bit busy. All my focus was on the work.
But I did miss you.
You're lying.
If you had missed me, you'd have called me.
Who forgets you? They say,
forgetful people fail in love and I'm your true lover.
How can I fail?
Will you ever deceive me?
What are you saying? How can I deceive you? And as it is,
Deceit and disloyalty aren't in my personality.
This is what I love about you.
Now finalize your business so that we can get married.
You just pray. I'm working hard. Alright, so...
I won't be able to meet you for a few days.
Why?
I just told you. We've started a business out of town and Manzoor has given me a duty.
We'll meet once that work is complete. Ok?
This is nice. But I'll let you go on one condition.
What?
You'll call me everyday from there?
I'll call you twice everyday from there.
Promise?
I promise.
Alright
Now you've made me eat such delicious food. Who'll get me tea?
Sweet or without sugar.
Without sugar.
I'll just get it.
Zara?
Are you alright?
Zaini, take your sister to her room. She'll rest.
Dad.. What happened with Zara?
Mom?
Maheen sister
Mom, come sit down. Be careful.
Dad..
Everything is finished.
Don't cry please. You'll get sick.
Let me get sick.
Let me get sick. What will I do by staying alive?
My only sister has left me today.
She did right. She did the right thing
I couldn't do anything for my son. Nor for Zara.
Dad please stop. Please.
You'll get sick. Don't.
They did everything knowingly.
Accusing someone knowingly is heavier than the skies.
Not even once did anybody's tongue falter while they assassinated my daughter's character.
They accused her.
Mom, Mahi and aunt wanted to throw Zara out of their house since day one.
And its all uncle's fault. He was quiet.
Mom, why didn't you ask uncle? He claimed to be Zara's protector.
Why didn't he stand with her on this occasion?
He didn't have any answer.
He kept standing silently like a puppet.
I've also decided.
After today, there will be no relationship with any of them.
Mom.. please don't cry.
You were right, Maheen.
I shouldn't have left Zara there because she said so.
They accused her of something so cheap. Mahi and my sister in law did.
How will she bear it all?
She accepted them with all her heart.
She never even uttered a word.
She gave them all so much respect.
See, what did they to my child?!
Mom.. Zara isn't alone. All of us are with her.
Aunty, don't worry at all.
Zara is not alone.
All of us will look after her together.
Saad, are you leaving?
I'll meet Zara before I leave.
She's sleeping right now.
I'll wait.
Saad.. what happened there?
Nothing.
I'm Zara's sister. Its important to know what happened there.
Whats the use of repeating things based on lies?
Saad, I asked you what happened there?
Who was he? Does Zara know him?
No.
But I'll find out. No matter where he's hiding, I'll find him.
I will not let him stay peacefully.
How will you find out?
I will. I will erase all stains on Zara's character.
Alright fine. Saad.. Relax..
Zaini.. you will not discuss anything about this with Zara.
She needs our support not our questioning.
I think you should go home right now. Aunty and Dolly are also worried there.
I'll not leave without meeting Zara.
Saad, I told you, she's sleeping.
You can come later and meet her.
Go right now. Change and relax.
Saad, what happened dear? Why do you look so worried?
Tell me what happened there?
Mom, nothing is right.
They threw Zara out of their house?
what!
Threw her out? But why?
Mom.. They accused Zara of having an affair with a boy.
God knows how that boy got to her room.
They didn't even give her a chance to clarify.
They accused her of something so cheap that she..
Mom, Zara staying there was very dangerous so we brought her back.
Its good that you did, dear.
You did good bringing her back. They've been mistreating that innocent child.
How many more problems would she have borne if she had stayed there.
You did good. And Ahmed? Didn't he say anything?
I'm amazed at him. He took Zara as his daughter and not his daughter in law.
Was he quiet as well? Didn't he say anything?
Mom, even Maheen asked this question.
All of us expected this of him. He could have spoken if he wanted to.
He also turned his face.
He did wrong. He shouldn't have done this.
He should have supported her. Stood with her.
We have brought that girl up. We know her well.
She's his own blood.
Mom, when a person is blindfolded by mistrust, nobody can see clearly.
They have a cheap mentality. Conservative mindsets.
God forgive me. Nobody is God fearing anymore.
I didn't do anything..
Mom, she has high fever.
I've called the doctor. He's on his way.
If her condition persists, we'll have to take her to the hospital.
Zara?
Get back in your senses, child. Zara, open your eyes.
Don't do this to me, dear. I cannot see you like this.
Mom, control yourself. Zara will feel sicker if you do this.
Ask her to open her eyes. Why is she doing this to me?
Mom, get a grip on yourself.
The doctor is coming. Don't worry. Everything will be alright.
Ali, you take mom to her room. I'm here with Zara.
Mom, please come to your room.
Maheen is here. She'll handle everything.
The doctor is coming too. Please come.
Please come to your room.
what will I do by going there, Ali?
Mom, the doctor will come. Everything will be alright. Maheen is here with Zara. Please come.
Please come.
Whats wrong with her, doctor? Why isn't she opening her eyes?
She's in shock or trauma. Something has happened that has shocked her brain intensely.
See, her position isn't good. She has weakness alongside high fever.
And I've felt that she has gone through an incident during the check up.
Yes, she had a miscarriage, recently.
Hmm. So she might be so depressed because of that.
Such situations cause this.
If you have her reports, please show them to me.
No. They're at her in laws'.
See, without knowing her history, I cannot start any treatment.
This could be dangerous for the patient.
I'm prescribing some medicines.
Give them to her on time. If God wills, her fever will subside soon.
Alright.
Thank you very much. Come, I'll drop you outside.
Don't worry. She'll be alright.
Thank you doctor.
Zara? Dear, open your eyes.
Zara, open your eyes, dear..
Finally, I've thrown you out of this house, Zara.
What did you think? You'd stay in our house forever?
You were very innocent.
You surrendered so soon. I thought you'd shout and scream but,
you were such a coward. You left your place so soon.
Its good that you left.
God knows what else I would have had to do with you.
You're safe for now. But what will you do?
Who will you show your wounds to?
Whoever will hear will point a finger at you?!
Poor you..
Now, we don't need you in this house and you're no longer valued here.
As far as these lifeless things are here. They'll be gone soon too.
If you didn't want Adeel's child, you could have given it to me. I'd have brought it up.
We would have left you alone to live life as you please.
Aunt, what are you saying? Show some respect at least.
I could never think of anything like this. I only have Adeel in my heart.
What are you saying?
Are you watching? How he's pining like a lover.
He has no shame or reserve.
We had heard that even a witch would attack sparing seven houses
but she.. she has attacked her own sister's house!
Aunt please....
Brother, why aren't you asleep yet?
I couldn't sleep.
Why are you still up?
I got up to check up on mom.
I saw the lawn's light turned on so I came here.
How's Zara?
She isn't good.
Ali told me what happened there...
It wasn't good.
She must be in a lot of difficulty
She is so nice. She always takes care of everyone and never thinks bad for anyone.
God knows why such bad things are happening with her.
God knows when will her problems end?
Brother, some people face tests all their life.
We can only pray that God make things easier for her.
I always pray for her.
Then why are you worried?
Prayers are never left unanswered. God will make everything better.
Amen.
Please come inside. Its late. Get some rest.
No. You go. I want to be alone for a while.
Alright. But come in soon. Its very late.
How is my daughter?
You still have a fever.
It was very high last night.
Come on now..
Have your breakfast and then I'll give you, your medicine.
Try and forget whatever happened, dear.
You're in your own house now.
What are you looking at dear?
You told me,
Adeel's house was my real house.
But now that's not my house anymore.
Which one is my house then, mom?
What can I say my dear?
Mom.. I..
I don't know him. I don't know who he was.
How did he come in my room. I don't know him. Do you trust me?
Yes dear. All of us trust you. We trust you. We have complete faith on you.
I trust my upbringing.
Mom, he entered my room and he held me like this..
I tried to free myself. But he didn't leave my hand, mom..
Adeel wasn't there but he was coming. I don't know why he didn't come, mom..
Mom, is it that Adeel doesn't trust me like everyone else? Mom, will he trust me?
Mom.. he didn't come.. He didn't come.. Mom...
You're here?
Yes.
The vegetables are cut in the kitchen. Go and make lunch.
If you've cut the vegetables, then why don't you cook as well?
What do you mean? I'm not cooking.
Am I the only one eating in the house that I'll do the cooking everyday.
You've started arguing with me.
What happened?
Mom, see.. I've told her that I've cut the vegetables and she needs to cook but she isn't.
Why are you acting up? When did I say, I'm not cooking?
Alright. Be quiet now. You both keep fighting all the time. Its not a good thing.
Shehla, do some other things. I'll see to the cooking. Go.
And you, Maheen.. you just came and you started.
Aunty, why do you always think I'm wrong?
Whether its my mistake or not, you always think I'm wrong
If you don't like me much, why don't you let me and Osama live separately.
Really?
Allowing you to live separately would mean that I'll be forgoing my son and it won't happen until I'm alive.
Then for God's sake, spare me because I'm fed up of all these arguments everyday.
Shaista, is Zara here?
Yes, she is.
Did you meet her?
No. I didn't but I'll have to meet her. She's all alone now, poor girl.
Yes, its important to meet her.
They didn't do good with the poor girl.
What do you think? Is Zara telling the truth?
What did you say?
Whatever Zara is saying is the truth. There's no question of lying.
She is telling the truth. But nobody should be accusing anyone like this.
Adnan, don't you always tell me whatever we see might not be the truth.
Alright, then if I say, shut your eyes this time as well.
What?
No. Nothing. I was just kidding. I'm upset about whatever happened with Zara.
Of course. We all are.
I'm going out for a walk, I feel heavy. You drink this tea.
But I made this for you.
You drink both the cups now. 
I've switched off the TV.
The second cup will go waste. I made such big cups of tea.
Shehla?
What happened mom?
What are you doing?
What did I do now?
See, Maheen is your sister in law.
 I didn't say anything to you in front of her
 but its becoming difficult for me trying to make you understand everyday.
You cook everyday, what would have happened if you had cooked today as well.
Then why is she here? If I have to do all the work..
She cooks dinner. What else should she do?
Ask her to make lunch as well. I cannot stand in front of the stove everyday.
Alright then. Open your ears and listen.
 I'll say yes to any proposal that comes for you now.
Mom, do you want to throw me out of the house?
I want you to get settled now. 
Once you're married I'll think about Sawera. You're growing older everyday. I cannot sit idle.
I understand everything. Maheen is feeding you all this.
No dear. Its nothing. Look,
Maheen is trying to change herself and we should give her a chance as well.
 Dear, we should give a chance to relationships so that they become strong.
Now you'll get married in the future. You'll also have sister in laws. 
And if you don't give them any place in your heart,
it would become difficult to live with them. 
See try and give Maheen some space in your heart. Even I'm trying.
I don't understand why are you saying all this nonsense?
See, Maheen's family does so much to nurture relationships. 
We should learn something from them.
Leave everything. I cannot do all this. Look at this..
I don't want to look at anything. 
Maheen is your sister in law. Don't argue with her all the time.
Aquib did everything?
Yes. 
You were right. I shouldn't have trusted him.
I was stupid.
Don't cry. I knew it would happen one day when you found the truth.
What was my fault in all this? I loved him with all my heart.
You loved a man who didn't even deserve you.
Forget him and focus on your studies. 
We have exams next month. Prepare for them and forget Aquib.
No. I've decided.
I'll not continue my studies.
Are you crazy? What will you do if you don't study?
I don't know.
You're making a mistake again, Mirha. 
Life doesn't stop if someone leaves.
Look at your sister in law. She forget your brother so soon. 
He loved her so much. Aquib was a fraud.
Will you stop your life for him?
What else can I do?
Try and complete your education. Give your exams.
 If you study well, you'll be able to support your family, Mirha.
What do you want? Your parents should get hurt because of you as well?
No. I don't want any such thing.
Then its decided. Focus on your future and forget everything else, Mirha.
Alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Take care of yourself. Bye.
Maheen.. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have talked to you like this
Its alright.
Its okay.
Alright, mom has served dinner. Come along.
I'm not hungry. You people eat.
See, if you don't eat today, nobody will eat.
I know you must be thinking why I took such a U turn all of a sudden.
What happened so suddenly?
Mom, made me understand. 
Actually when you came here, we were very insecure because of you.
But aunty liked me herself. I'm her choice then why such insecurity.
Because we have heard that brothers change after they get married.
We also thought the same that no matter who our brother married, she'd take away our brother from us.
Even mom thought this when brother was interested in you. 
This is why we didn't let you adjust in this house.
But yes, once you left, we found out that you had not only made a place in brother's heart but also in our hearts as well.
How can I accept that whatever you're saying, you're saying with all your heart?
Maheen, don't test relationships.
If you're not satisfied, you can test.
You people must be planning something against me. I know very well.
If we had to call off your wedding, we'd have done it long ago. Think about what I said.
Right now. Mom has served dinner and she's calling you. Come.
