Dolly?
Hello. Hello.
See what I brought?
What is all this, Ali?
This is for our baby to come. I've also brought sweets for mom.
But Ali, there's a lot of time left.
If we start now, we'll be able to do something on time.
Whats inside?
Clothes. Check.
Ali, you've brought clothes for girls and boys too.
Yes since the doctor said there was time for us to find the gender so I bought both.
Don't you like them?
They're very cute.
There were so many other things but I couldn't understand.
We'll go together for shopping now.
Why are you smiling? Are you laughing at me?
No... I'm proud of you.
Do you know Ali, after dad died, I missed him everyday.
But I never mentioned this to anyone
but there wasn't even a single moment when I didn't miss dad.
Ali I want our child to receive love from his mother and father.
He should be complete with our love.
This will happen by the will of God.
Our child will receive love from his mother and father.
Whether its a girl or a boy, we'll make no difference.
Alright. What else have you got?
Have you lost your mind, Mahi? Who gives jewelry on such occasions?
I'll just give her five hundred rupees.
I don't even have a five hundred note. I have thousands. Go and bring me change.
Mom, you'll give this. We need to show off at times.
Mom everybody should know that you've accepted Zara with an open heart and mind.
Understand what I'm saying.
So dear, this is what I'm saying. Maheen...
What happened? Did Maheen do something again?
What should I do about this girl?
I'm tired of trying to explain her but she doesn't understand.
Even I didn't like she left without meeting Dolly.
Isn't it? You noted. She thinks everybody is her enemy and tries to show her down.
But why?
Why does she think that? Don't you ask her?
Why won't I? I've asked and tried to explain many times. But she doesn't understand.
You saw her. She didn't take sweets from Dolly.
She said she was trying to taunt her that she didn't have a child after so many years of her marriage.
I'm worried about Maheen. Why does she think so negative?
since when its happening?
Not today. She's been like this since forever. God knows what she has in that brain of hers.
And now her mother in law is taunting her too.
What? Why didn't you tell me earlier?
She told me two days ago.
You should talk to her mother in law.
Children are written in our fate. She'll have them when its time.
Usama and his mother should understand this.
I'll talk to Usama.
You cannot. Maheen has strictly told me not to talk to anyone.
If we don't talk, how long will this go on for?
God knows how long will this go on for? I'm just..
I'm praying for my daughters.
Did you see the news, Mahi?
yes
The inflation is risen. Petrol prices have sky rocketed.
Work fast. I have to cook and send the food
I'm working mom. Just give me two minutes.
Hurry up please..
Where are you going? Cut the vegetables..
You didn't do good, Mahi.
You didn't reach on the time I gave you. Now you've made an enemy out of me.
You'll see the consequences of your mistake. Remember this.
I will punish you severely for this mistake. You'll keep writhing in pain.
Mom.. I've served breakfast. Come.
Mom, I'm getting late. I'm going to the office.
Zaini, come, have breakfast. I've made omelet for you.
I'm not hungry.
Okay mom. Bye.
Bye dear.
Don't worry, dear. She'll be fine. It will take some time.
Its been a week mom.
Zaini hasn't talked to me.
She is very uncomfortable because I'm here.
I don't like it mom..
I'll go back.
Its a wound on her heart, dear. It will take time to heal.
You know how she is.
She doesn't speak. She keeps everything to herself.
Are you worried for Zaini?
Yes.
If there is someone to apply salve, the wounds heal quickly.
I'm praying she finds someone too. Soon.
Zara, get water for mom..
Oh..
Zara isn't here.
If you're missing her so much. Why don't you bring her back?
She's been there for many days now.
She feels at home there, mom.
When she doesn't want to come here, what right do I have to bring her here?
Why are you talking like a child, Saad? You're her husband.
You have a right to her. You can bring her back.
Look at me.
What is it? Are you hiding something from me?
Nothing mom. I'll get you water.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you. I don't want water. Tell me what is it?
What are you hiding from me?
Dear, you already lost so much by keeping things in your heart.
Now again, don't repeat the same mistake.
Tell me dear. What is between the two of you?
Dear, the relationships that have been made, don't lose them now.
What is it? Tell me.
Mom, Zara wants to take a divorce.
What?
But why?
Mom, she thinks whatever happened with me was wrong.
Now, when everything is getting fixed, she wants me to leave her and marry Zaini.
Dear.. Zara, why would she do this? How can she say this?
This is the truth, mom.
That's why she has gone home.
She wants a chance to tell the truth.
You hid such a big thing from me.
How can you two take such a big decision?
My consent isn't there mom.
Zara wants it.
Whats wrong with this girl? Why is she doing this?
I'll get you water.
What are you saying, mom? Is this why Zara is here?
Ever since I've heard. I'm feeling sicker.
Has she lost her mind? Is she crazy? What is she doing?
I don't know myself. Ask brother Manzoor to talk to his daughter.
What is this? She can marry or leave whenever she likes
Mom, you shouldn't have let Zara come here.
You know how much chaos this can create, mom.
Ali can leave me..
Leave you? How can he leave you? You're expecting his child.
Mom, anything can happen. Please save my life, mom. Stop Zara from this stupidity.
Dear, what can I do? Tell me.
Make brother understand. What is he doing? Why is he doing all this?
Tell Saad to take her back.
How can he leave her? Marriage isn't a child's play.
I'll talk to him. Don't you worry.
Its not good to get angry in this condition.
Mom, you don't understand. This cannot happen. You'll have to make Saad understand.
How can he leave Zara? Its a marriage, not a game.
Alright..
Dolly?
Who are you talking to?
Mom, I'll talk to you later.
hello!
Oh God.. What will happen now?
I told her too. She didn't listen to me. But its alright. The class went well.
Mirha..
I will not let you leave without listening to me.
You'll have to hear me out.
Please..
Zara? What? Were you talking to Saad, dear?
Why?
I feel that ever since you're here, you haven't talked to Saad.
Is everything alright between you two?
Everything is fine, mom.
He's very busy with his work.
Are you telling the truth?
Hello mom..
Hello.
See what I brought?
Oh my dear. So many things? What happened? Why did you spend so much?
Hello.
Hello. Mom, I've been promoted.
Really? Thank God. May God bless my son with a lot of success.
Congratulations, dear.
Amen.
Congratulations, Saad.
Thank you.
I'll have a little. Give the rest to Zara.
Zara
Mom.. I bought this for you.
Really?
My child.. my dear, my life..
This is for Ali and Dolly.
Dear, why did you have to be so formal?
And look at this. I brought this for Zara.
For Zara? Show me.. Oh wow..
This is beautiful Zara. Did you see? Its such a beautiful color.
It will suit you.
Saad, why did you have to get me this? I don't need new clothes.
What do you do, dear?
He brought this with so much love.
Its alright mom. We'll give it to Dolly.
Zara, whats wrong dear?
He's your husband and he bought this for you with so much love. At least you could have kept his heart.
You could have praised a little.
Now see, his mood is spoilt.
Aunty, I didn't mean to hurt him.
Dear, nobody hurts anyone willingly.
He's your husband dear and its your duty to honor his likes and dislikes dear.
See, dear..
I spent my life all alone without my husband.
But my God didn't leave me alone in this as well.
My children were my support and that's why I couldn't even think about the storms I had in my life.
I spent my life with my children. But dear, you're lucky.
God has given you another chance as Saad.
Don't lose the happiness you have in your husband. See, dear..
If Saad is forgetting his past and taking a step towards you,
you should also, forget your past and all the troubles,
start afresh.
Dear, life doesn't give you a chance again and again.
Don't lose this chance, dear.
Dolly, who were you talking to? Whose leaving whom?
Ali.. actually..
Dolly I'm asking you clearly and I want a clear answer.
Who were you talking too?
It was mom.
Zara and Saad..
Ali... There's nothing right between Zara and Saad.
We need to talk to mom and dad.
Don't take me wrong, Ali, but,
someone should ask Zara why is she here since so many days?
What do you mean by this? She's here for dad.
She's not here for dad. Ali, Zara and Saad had an argument.
Why is she here? They don't want to be together.
What nonsense? Who told you this?
Mom called, Ali.
She was crying.
She is already sick and after all this, she's suffering.
You should ask Zara.
I don't understand.
You should talk to mom and dad.
How can Saad do this? I'll talk to Zara...
Zara..
Not right now, Ali.
Zara? Zara?
Ali, let it be. You don't have to.
Why are you shouting like this?
What is this new drama?
What happened? Tell me.
Saad wants to divorce her.
Ask her, what she did now. Why have you both made our lives hell?
She gets insulted at uncle's house, then she tests us and now she isn't at peace at Saad's house.
Ask her. What does she want?
What is Ali, saying?
I was just asking you if everything is alright between the two of you and you said everything was alright.
You lied to me, again.
Again, Zara?
What did you do?
Why does Saad want to divorce you?
I was about to tell you, mom.
What? What were you about to tell me?
Brother, I wanted to tell everyone.
Go away from our lives. Let us be. What do you want?
I get one happy news and then you land in between that as well. What do you want?
And this.. Dolly.. She's my wife. I love her and I want to live with her.
If what you want, happens, this relationship will also end.
Brother...
And I don't want my child to be brought up in such an environment
It would be better if I just kill myself. I'll be rid of you.
what's wrong with you, brother?
God forbid.. Whats wrong dear?
Brother, you don't have to destroy your life or your relationship because of me.
My decision will not affect your relationship
And what happened to you, Zara?
How can you accept such a ridiculous thing, Saad said? What happened between the two of you? Tell me.
Nothing happened, mom. Nothing at all.
And its not even Saad's fault.
Its my decision to leave Saad.
I don't want to live with Saad. I want to go far away from his life.
I don't accept this.
Mahi told me everything Aquib. You committed the robbery in our house.
And you lied to love me because you wanted money.
Tell me now, is this the truth?
And you're here again because you want more money.
And you'll blackmail me now?
If I wanted to blackmail you, I wouldn't have come in front of you.
I also have your new number.
In fact, I also know whats going on in your house.
I don't want to blackmail you.
Then why are you here?
To apologize to you.
Apologize? Liar.
Whatever you did, you want me to forgive you so easily for this?
You destroyed my sister in law's life, Aquib.
Do you even realize what you did?
I know how wrong I did, Mirha. And I'm regretting it even today.
But I accused your sister in law because your sister forced me to do all this.
What else could I have done? Tell me.
If I hadn't done that, I'd have been in jail today and my life would have been destroyed.
I did whatever I thought was right back then.
I know I wronged you and your family.
Please give me a chance to rectify my mistake. Please Mirha.
What will you go by all this?
Peace.
Staying away from you made me realize that I loved you.
I hate your face, Aquib.
Mirha, give me a chance, please.
You don't deserve to be forgiven, Aquib.
You destroyed my and my sister in law's life.
You should now burn in the fire we burnt it.
Why? Why do you want a divorce from Saad?
What drama are you two creating now?
Because he doesn't love me mom. And neither do I love him.
He loves Zaini. I was forced in his life.
Both of us don't love each other, mom.
What do you want to show doing all this?
That you're great?
No Zaini. I don't want anything.
Your happiness means a lot to me. I want to see you happy.
For God's sake, stop with your drama.
I don't want the love you're giving me in charity.
That love was always rightfully yours Zaini. I was never even a part of this story.
You got away from Saad because of your own insecurity.
I'll tell you. Don't repeat the mistakes you've already made.
Give yourself a chance. Give Saad a chance.
You said you wanted this.
But does Saad want this as well?
Tell me.
Saad wants the same thing, mom.
He still loves Zaini.
No mom. I don't want anything like this.
Then go and bring Zara back, dear.
She won't listen mom. She's very stubborn.
She'll do what she decides.
Dear, this will only bring destruction.
You will not be happy yourself or keep anybody else happy.
I had compromised with my life, mom.
And I was happy with this compromise.
I saw Zara was happy too.
It could be a lie too.
Dear, you both will break your home because you're being stubborn.
Mom, a house with weak foundations will fall shortly.
Saad..
Saad, my child, try once. Save your home from fall apart.
Don't make deals that will give you a loss.
I've had dinner mom.
Does Saad want the same thing? Tell me.
Saad wants the same thing, mom. 
He still loves Zaini.
How dare she? 
She dared to cut my call?
Now you'll see what I do with you..
Who...
What happened Mahi? Why are you scared?
I'm not scared mom. Why would I be scared?
What else? 
There is something. Will you not tell your mother?
Tell me at least. What did you do now? 
Will you hide it from me as well?
Is it about Zara?
Whats wrong with you? Why do you think I'm always thinking about Zara?
So am I lying? This happens always.
Its not like that mom. I have a headache.
Come on, I'll take you to the doctor.
I don't want to go mom. Let me rest for a while.
Wow.. she's amazing.
What happened Manzoor? Why are you sitting like this? Why aren't you sleeping?
I'm not sleepy. I feel restless.
Even I don't understand anything. 
What should I tell Zara? 
Should I support her or should I send her back home?
If Zara goes back to Saad, will everything settle down? 
What about the distances between the two?
I don't know. I've felt both of them aren't happy together. 
That's why Zara has decided to leave him.
I don't think all this is right.
You should talk to Zara. 
Its not something ordinary to make or break relationships.
You should talk to Saad.
I think Zaini and Saad should talk.
If Saad agrees to all this, I won't have an issue. 
But first Saad and Zaini should talk at least.
So you should talk to Saad
Yes.
Who is calling so late at night?
Its Maheen.
Oh God.. have mercy.
Yes, Maheen? What is it, dear? Is everything alright?
Alright. Tomorrow? What time? Alright. Bye.
What did she say?
She wants me to go to the clinic with her.
You should go. God will make everything alright. I'll try and sleep.
Wow. Zara you're amazing. You've decided to leave Saad. 
You'll come back in this house again, in my reach.
And nobody can do me any harm. 
Neither your husband Saad nor anybody else.
You'll now realize how merciful fate is for me. And you..
Poor Saad.. he couldn't have Zaini nor Zara.
 But you don't worry. I have a lot to show you.
 A lot.
Yes, Inspector, how did you call me?
Saad, I wanted to give you an important news.
Yes tell me?
The person you were looking for has been spotted in this area and we'll nab him soon enough.
Thank you so much sir. Its very important to catch him. 
I want to prove someone is innocent.
I want to erase the stains on someone's character.
Don't worry. We'll arrest him soon and give him a harsh sentence.
Thank you so much sir.
I'd tell you to think about it once more. 
Its not right, whatever you want to do.
So what is right for you, mom?
 Is whatever happening, right? Normal?
See dear..
 Its not only you two in this relationship. 
There are a lot of people in this relationship.
Their lives, their happiness and their emotion are attached to this.
 Think about them as well.
Emotions!
I made the wrong decision because I was emotional.
It wasn't your decision only. Our consent was with you.
I agree dear, we still don't know what was right and wrong at that time.
 But if you want to do this to prove yourself innocent, don't do it.
 You'll be left empty handed.
Accept it as God decision for you. 
Bury the past.
My hands are empty of your and dad's trust, mom. 
And whatever I have left,
that is a mud house. 
It can topple anytime if it faces a storm.
Its better if I change my home
Don't be so hopeless.
 You're thinking wrong.
Absolutely wrong.
For your and dad's trust, for Zaini's happiness.. no matter what I have to do..
I'll do it. 
And this time it will be my decision.
I will decide myself now.
Oh wow... I get to see you everyday..
If only my desire doesn't end
Move out of my way.
I won't. 
You haven't changed one bit. You still haven't changed your habit of saying no.
If you say another word, you'll see the worse of me.
Adnan, uncle.. you here..
I was going out for some work and I thought I'd ask your mother in law if she needs something.
Mom is in the lawn. Go there and ask.
Please come inside, I have to discuss something important with you.
Go. I'll meet her in the lawn.
Why is everyone so down? Why am I not?
What is it, Dolly?
Zara, don't mind what I said. I would have gone to mom's house but,
you know the doctor has asked me to rest. Even if I go, I won't be able to look after mom.
How can I go there, Dolly?
Why can't you go? Its your house, Zara.
Which relation should I go back with?
What do you mean Zara? You're the daughter in law of that house.
You have decided that you don't want to live there. But none of us.
 Even I don't want it Zara.
I've decided Dolly.
And I'll not step back.
You'll have to step back. 
You'll have to listen to me for the sake of the peace of this house.
Zara, Ali's condition because of you. You know it. 
What else do you want?
I'm afraid Zara. Your hasty decision will put us all in a loss. 
Please go back to mom's house, Zara.
It is best for mine and Ali's relationship.
What are you saying, Dolly?
I'm saying whatever nobody will say to you here. 
Decide whatever you want to decide with Saad together but leave from here right now.
I cannot see Ali worried because of you, anymore.
