Ali, did you make your friend talk to the doctor?
Yes mom. I made the doctor talk to him.
Dad is handling the police.
Don't worry. Everything will be alright. We'll handle everything.
Tell them to let me see my daughter once. I won't be at peace until I see her.
Once I saw her, I'll be fine.
Mom, not now. Just wait for a little while.
The doctor will tell herself.
Don't worry. Everything will be alright
.
Oh God, have mercy.
Why did you do this, Zaini? Why did you?
Mom!
Why is she here? Tell her to go away from here. Tell her to leave.
Why are the two of you here?
Is there something left?
I want to meet Zaini.
I'm warning you. Don't even take Zaini's name.
She is in this condition because of you.
If something happens to her, I will not forgive you two.
Mom, what are you saying? Nothing will happen to Zaini.
Her life is as dear to me, as its to you.
At least, let Zara meet her.
She cannot.
And if something happens to her, we'll never forgive you two.
What are you saying? Nothing will happen to Zaini.
Tell them to leave Ali. Tell them.
Mom..
Didn't you two hear? Leave!
I will not leave, until I meet Zaini.
If you don't leave,
then you'll see me dead.
Mom..
Go from here. Go.
Why are you being so harsh? Why?
I have nobody other than you. Don't do this to me.
This man standing with you.. he's all you have now.
We don't have any relationship with you.
Doctor, how is my daughter?
See, your daughter's condition was very serious but timely treatment saved her life.
But please try and not do anything similar with her again
which gives her stress or makes her repeat this mistake.
It isn't good for her mental health.
Doctor, can I meet my daughter?
Not yet. After a while, one by one.
We will keep her under observation today. You can take her home tomorrow.
Thank you doctor.
Thank God.
Didn't you hear what the doctor said? You will not see her. Leave.
Come on Zara.
Adnan.. Adnan.. wake up and listen to me.
What is it?
Wake up.
Oh.. whats the problem? What happened?
We have to go to the hospital.
Right now? If you're unwell, we'll go in the morning.
I am fine. Zaini, downstairs, have taken sleeping pills.
Zaini took sleeping pills?
Yes. Sarwat called that she had taken sleeping pills.
They're at the hospital. We'll have to go too.
They have gone to the hospital, right? I cannot go. I'm sleepy.
You're the limit. Why shouldn't we go? We have to go.
If there was an emergency, we'd have received a call from the hospital. We didn't. This means she's fine.
We'll go in the morning.
Adnan, come with me. Please.
Listen, I'm sleepy. If you're not sleepy, shut off the lights and go.
Keep on sleeping.
Sleep!
You?
What are the two of you doing here?
You shouldn't have come here.
Zaini's condition is because of you two.
Maheen, you go. I'll come.
Maheen? Maheen?
Did you two meet Zaini?
They didn't let us meet.
Don't cry. Everything will be alright.
Its not right for you to meet Zaini right now. Her condition isn't good
Usama is right.
It isn't right to meet Zaini right now.
Don't worry Zara. As soon as Zaini is better, I'll ask aunty and uncle.
Everything will be alright.
Saad? You people were very late.
What happened? Everything alright?
Yes mom. We were waiting for Zaini to stabilize.
How is she now?
She's better.
Hmm.. But how did this happen?
Why are you asking him, mom?
Ask Zara. She's behind all this.
Its because of Zara that Zaini attempted suicide and now my life is in trouble.
How many of you will you fool with your innocence?
You should be ashamed of playing with your sister's life.
What are you saying? Are you in your senses?
You let it be, brother.
Whatever is happening is because of Zara.
Its because of her, Zaini is in this condition.
I'm telling you brother.
If Ali leaves me, I'll leave this world.
And you both will be responsible for all this.
Dolly, what happened to you? What are you saying?
What are you saying? Why are you blaming Zara? Its not her fault.
Yes. Zara is never at fault. We are.
No matter what we do.
No matter what she does, she'll always be right and we'll be wrong.
What do you want brother? What do you want?
We'll have to bear this trouble all our life.
Saad, dear, whether both of you accept it or not.
But it is because of the two of you, Dolly's life is being affected.
Do you know Ali is calling her again and again and threatening her?
If God forbid, something happens to Zaini..
Aunty, Ali isn't like this. Whatever he said, he said in anger.
He cannot do this. He loves Dolly a lot.
He loves her a lot.
I saw.
Dolly?
See Zara.. Talk to your family, dear.
If its because of you that Dolly's life is destroyed,
you'll not stay in this house too. I'm telling you.
Zaini? My dear..
Let the patient rest, don't talk much.
What did you do, my child? If something had happened to you then?
Mom.. Mom..
Why did Saad and Zara do this to me?
Why did Saad break my trust mom?
Why did they do this to me? What did I do to harm them?
If they...
Please don't recall. Don't punish yourself.
Life doesn't stop if anybody leaves, my child. We're here with you.
I am here.. Your dad is here. Do you even know how your dad is right now?
For us dear. For us dear. Be strong.
Please compose yourself.
Mom, I'll never forgive them. I will never forgive them.
She was my sister, mom.. Why did she do this to me?
Enough my child. Enough..
Why did she do this to me, mom? I'll never forgive her.
I'll never forgive them.
Zara, compose yourself
Stop crying.
What can I do, Saad?
My siblings, my home,
I've lost everything.
Everybody feels, I'm the culprit.
Even here, everybody thinks the same.
Your mother, your sister, everybody feels the same.
Saad, you do know I didn't do anything, we didn't do anything. We're not at fault.
We didn't do anything.
Zaini is right.
Zaini was right. I should have died with Adeel.
Zara!
I cannot tolerate it Saad. I cannot bear it, Saad.
If something happens to Zaini, Saad, I won't forgive myself. Ever.
Zaini will be alright. Will she?
She's fine. We talked to the doctor. She's fine.
Please compose yourself
I'm fine. Zaini.. Zaini.. Nothing should happen to Zaini.
Saad..
Will nobody talk to me now?
Will they leave me alone now?
Zara...
Saad.. I want to talk to Zaini. Make me talk to her. I'll talk to her.
I will clear her misunderstanding. I want to tell her I didn't do anything, Saad.
There's no use discussing this now, Zara.
Its too late now.
Zaini's life is destroyed. Because of me.
Whats wrong with me, Saad?
I destroyed Zaini's life. What did I do.
I destroyed Zaini's life.
Zara, you go to sleep for a while.
I will not be able to sleep, Saad.
Try.
Will Zaini have slept?
Will she have felt sleepy?
She must have slept. You also sleep.
Try.
Ali.. take your father home. I'm here with Zaini.
No mom. I'll stay here.
How can I go home, dear? What if something happen to her?
How will I be at peace? I cannot rest.
Nothing will happen mom. I'm with her.
You can come in the morning.
Aunty, Ali is right. A lot of people cannot stay here and even I think Ali should stay.
You and uncle come with me. I'll drop you.
Alright. We'll go after a while. We'll take a riksha. Don't worry.
Don't be stubborn. Go with Usama. I'm here with Zaini.
Sit by her bedside. Don't move.
Even if she feels a bit unwell, call me. I won't be able to sleep.
Mom, don't worry. I'll be with Zaini. I'll keep updating you.
Happy engagement anniversary..
I'm so sorry, I completely forgot.
 Zaini, I'm sorry. It skipped my mind.
I'm sorry.. 
Zaini..
Oh, why do you bother? You could have asked Shaista to do everything.
Yes. You could have asked me.
I made soup for Zaini. I thought I'd make her eat it today.
How is Zaini now?
All thanks to God.
So when will she be discharged from the hospital?
I think she'll be discharged by today.
Thank God, her life was saved.
Just pray for my daughter to be patient, Shaista. She's seen a very tough time.
Let her come home. We'll make her busy.
Manzoor told me to get her enrolled in a university.
Yes. This would be better for her. If she's busy in her studies, she'll forget everything.
Alright. I'll leave now.
If you say, should I come with you?
Adnan is right, Sarwat. Go with Adnan. Why trouble Manzoor?
I would be grateful if you drop me, Adnan.
Give this to me.
Lets go.
Alright. I'll leave now.
Yes. You go ahead. I'll look after everything.
Maheen said she'd come and look after the kitchen but its her sister in law's engagement today. I asked her to come tomorrow.
Why do you worry? I'll look after everything.
Family comes to help in such troubled times. We'll handle everything together.
Alright. I'll just come.
Don't worry. I'll handle everything. Don't worry.
Come dear.
Hello girls.
Where were you lost?
Actually I had gone to Lahore.
You didn't even tell us.
I didn't get time. I was in a rush, I couldn't tell.
What did you get for us?
Its a surprise.
Give it to me. I cannot wait.
Wait a minute.
What is this?
My engagement card.
You're getting engaged? 
To whom?
So many questions at once? He's my aunt's son.
He's in Lahore. My parents have accepted his proposal for me.
You've given us a very good news.
Congratulations.
This won't do. You people have to come with your family.
Of course. We'll definitely come. Isn't it Mirha?
We'll definitely come.
Zaini?
Why are you here?
How are you?
Are you here to see how I am still alive?
Why have you become so distrusting? 
I'm here to meet you. For you.
Saad.. you already have someone else in your heart now.
At least, don't lie to me now. Please. Leave.
I have nothing left to give you, except hatred.
Of course. You can hate me but.. don't think I'm a cheater.
I never cheated on you Zaini.
Disloyal men never accept they have been disloyal, ever.
In fact, they pretend to be loyal to hide their sins. Exactly like you.
You doubt my loyalty? 
Alright. But don't punish yourself.
If something happens to you, I'll never be able to forgive myself.
You've already punished me.
I wanted to be rid of this punishment forever, but I couldn't.
See, even my fate isn't merciful.
Maybe I'm alive so that I can hurt about your disloyalty forever.
Zaini, please. 
Please trust me once. 
I will fix everything. I promise I will. Just once.
What will happen then? What? Will you come back to me?
Will you leave Zara? 
Tell me, Saad. Will you come back to me?
Saad, my heart is broken into a thousand pieces. 
Its not possible for it to break into more pieces.
You have turned down my love. What else do you want from me?
Zaini..
Saad please.. Leave from here.
I don't even want to see your face. Please Saad, 
leave from here. Excuse me.. is someone there?
Excuse me? Nurse?
Was this Saad? He came out of Zaini's room? 
Will Zaini be alright?
Everything will be alright.
Hold this. I'll come in two minutes. You go to Zaini.
Go and see.
You're luck is good Saad. 
But don't worry. I'll not spare you.
Zaini? Saad went out from your room? Why did he come?
He was apologizing?
How dare he come here? I'll talk to the staff. I told them not to let anybody else come here.
No mom.. Let it be. He will never come back to meet me.
This was our last meeting. 
Please mom.. I don't want to talk about it now.
Saad, my heart is broken into thousand pieces. 
Its not possible for it to break anymore.
You have already turned down my love. What else do you want from me?
Zaini..
Saad please.. Leave from here. I don't want to see your face.
Dolly? You haven't eaten anything since morning. Eat something.
Why are you here?
Who told you to make breakfast for me?
You haven't eaten anything since morning.
Aunt is worried because of you.
You think you'll make breakfast for me and I'll eat it?
Its not like that, Dolly.
Pick it up and go. I don't want to eat.
Why be upset with food? You're not eating and aunty is worried.
Mom is worried because of you, not because of me, Zara.
And you're sitting here so comfortably. 
You're not even guilty or embarrassed.
You didn't even worry about your sister's feelings.
Don't say that Dolly. She's my sister and I worry for her.
I can see that. I can see how hurt you are or how you worry about your sister? 
Zara, anything that your shadow touches,
it gets destroyed. 
Take it and leave my room.
And don't ever enter my room without my permission. 
I'm amazed to see you. 
Your face is so peaceful and satisfied.
Looking at you so peaceful, I get uncomfortable, Zara.
If Ali leaves me, I'll not let you live peacefully.
I'll destroy you. 
Remember this. 
Take this and get lost.
Take it away from here, please.
Zara? Why did you go see Dolly?
I just wanted to make it up to her.
I can see whatever you're trying for.
 I told you to talk to your family. Did you talk to someone?
No. I couldn't talk to anyone. 
Mom and dad are worried about Zaini. Give me some time
Let it be.
If I depend upon you, my daughter's house will be destroyed. 
You cannot handle it. I'll talk to them myself.
