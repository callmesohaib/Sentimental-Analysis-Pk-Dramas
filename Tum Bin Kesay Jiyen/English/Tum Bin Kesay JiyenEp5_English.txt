Mom asked about who you were?
I told her I didn't know. I just had an accident with your bike.
Did she doubt?
No. I handled it for now. You tell me, how are you?
Let me be. Tell me about yourself.
You got hurt more.
No Aqib. I'm fine.
The doctor said that the pain will last for a week or so and it'll be fine then. It hurts.
Tell me what he said. A week or so is way too much.
Aqib, can I lie to you?
Are you sure?
What will I get lying to you?
But tell me where is your other number. I cannot call the other number.
Yes. My mobile fell down.
I lost it where I had the accident. Didn't I tell you?
Oh. You are in a great loss.
It must be around 50 60 thousand.
I'm glad that I was safe. I could always buy a new phone.
Yes, this is so.
If something had happened to you. I wouldn't have forgiven myself.
Again that nonsense Aqib. Nothing happened to me. I'm fine.
And if something had happened to me, you wouldn't have done it deliberately.
Mom's here. I'll talk to you later.
Bye!
Who were you talking to?
My friend Nageen. She got worried when she found out so she called.
Did anyone call from Karachi?
Yes Adeel called.
Did Zara talk to you?
Yes, Mahi. sister Zara, Adeel, everybody talked to me.
Everything to show Adeel.
Don't fall for her sympathies. All this is a drama.
Had she worried about you so much, she'd have called me.
Her parents would have talked to me.
But no..
They are a family of ill mannered people. God, my son is stuck amongst such careless people.
Mom, aunt is calling. Do you want to talk?
I have soup cooking for you. Talk to her yourself.
Hello? Hello aunt.
How are you? I'm fine. A lot better than before.
Adeel, I'll help you with the packing.
I'm sorry Zara.
Adeel.. Perhaps you're forgetting. We promised each other.
We decided we'd not fight amongst ourselves because of a third person.
Yes I know.
But whatever happened, it wasn't right.
Everybody is worried because of Mahi.
She's also worried because of Mirha.
When a person is worried, they don't understand what to do.
She doesn't worry about anyone.
She only knows how to irritate others.
Why are you worrying? As it is, your friend is married now.
You had to go back
Yes. I did. But not like this.
Please don't worry. Everything will be alright. You're going on a journey. Be happy.
I promise you, Zara.
I'll always keep you happy.
I'll not let anybody wrong you again.
I have full faith.. on you and on myself.
Alright. Talk to aunt.
She just gets angry for a little while. I'll make her understand when she talks to me.
Mahi is calling.
You talk. I'll leave.
Uncle, don't worry. I've arranged for Maham and Adeel's travel.
They won't have any problems.
Its a good thing.
You always support us. How can I thank you?
Uncle, you call me your son and then you want to thank me.
May God bless everyone with an obedient son like you.
Amen.
Alright, I'll take your leave now.
No. How can you leave like this? I'll call Zara or Zaini. Have tea.
No uncle. Not today.
Is everything alright, dear? You've never turned me down.
Uncle. I'm helpless today. Mom is not well. I have to take her to the hospital.
If I get late, we'll be late then.
Oh. No dear. You go ahead. Take care. Bye.
May God bless him. Zara..
Zaini?
Saad?
Bye aunt.
Bye. May God keep you safe.
Bye uncle.
Take care.
Okay uncle.
Alright.
May you live long. Bless you.
Do you understand something about what happened with you?
You talk so much and now,
when you have to discuss something important, you're quiet Zara.
What should I say about it? Whatever is happening is in front of you.
Whatever is happening in front of us, there is more happening behind our backs.
And you, you're not that stupid. You understand everything.
I don't understand what Adeel has fed you that,
you cannot even talk to him.
Why are you arguing amongst yourselves? Please talk calmly.
I'm not arguing. I'm just talking to her.
She'll be thinking I'm creating problems without any reason like you feel I react unnecessarily.
Now I'm in your list as well?
I know what they'll discuss too.
Its a girl who has to spend her life once she gets married, not them.
Why doesn't she understand?
They're not human beings but those mother and daughters are witches. They'll eat her alive.
Nothing will happen like this.
You're still saying this. I cannot believe it. I'm very upset.
See, rather than crying later, its good that you decide now.
If Adeel cannot leave them, tell him to shift to Karachi. He can get a house here and live here.
Zara what are you thinking?
See, I accept that Adeel is a very nice boy and he loves you very much.
But what about his family?
They will not let you be happy. They'll destroy you.
Think about it. You'll have to think about it.
Is it right to discuss all this before the wedding?
Yes. It is right to talk now. How will listen to this once they're married?
Once you're married, he'll start loving his mother and sisters. Boys change in a jiffy.
Adeel has promised me that he'll never let me get worried.
He'll support me in all situations.
And you believed him?
I believe Adeel completely. He'll never betray me.
Alright. If something bad happens later, don't come to me. I'll not even talk about it.
Nothing bad will happen to me.
I pray to God that nothing bad happens with you and your trust stays intact.
Don't worry. You know she's habitual of speaking without thinking.
Please don't worry. Everything will be fine, if God wills.
Here's your tea.
Have they reached or not?
To tell you Manzoor, I didn't really like what Maham did yesterday.
Even I'm worried about Zara
but you should find out whether they've reached or not.
They should have reached by now. Did anybody call?
I did try calling twice but the phone was unreachable.
Try calling again.
I don't understand how you got into an accident.
Mom, didn't I tell you?
I got hit by bike.
Mom.. aunt is calling.
Don't answer. I don't want to talk.
Mom, it'll be fun. Throw in a few taunts.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello. So you miss me now?
Is everything alright?
I tried calling earlier as well but your number was unreachable.
Really?
I don't know.
My phone was switched on. You're talking on the same number.
Yes. Maybe there was a network problem.
By the way Sarwat, you're older and elder than your brother
but you couldn't call after the accident.
You're calling after 24 hours to get done with the formality.
Its great.
Have you forgotten that this isn't your brother's house only but your daughter's in laws as well?
Do you remember or not?
Trust me, I tried calling you twice to ask you about the kids.
I called Mirha then. I talked to her. You can ask her.
Yes. Mirha told me.
So how is Mirha now?
She's fine, thank God.
I don't know who was the wretched person to cast an evil eye on my daughter.
Have the children reached safely?
Yes. They're here.
Alright. I called to ask this only. Bye.
She was acting so innocent. God knows how people put up such dramas.
She's very clever. Not innocent at all.
Has everyone reached safely?
Yes they have.
What did she say?
Nothing much.
Is your tea cold? Should I heat it up?
Yes. No. I'm drinking it.
You look upset.
Its nothing. I'm not upset.
Why are you asking me the same question again and again? Whats your problem?
I didn't insult anyone. I said the truth.
I just said what was in my heart.
I'm not two faced like your mother in law. She's always humming. Oh God save us..
If she didn't call right after the accident, why did she call 24 hours later when you people had reached home?
Tell me. Don't you understand all this?
Are you watching Mahi, how clever that woman is?
Mom, don't include them with you. You're enough, alone.
And if she did call late, what is the big issue?
Its not about the call but about the importance and closeness.
The entire world will call after two three days to inquire. People will come according to their suitable time and ask how she's doing.
Family doesn't do this.
Adeel, don't mind.
Your in laws didn't even follow the traditions.
We were coming back from their place.
Someone could have come along, but they didn't think it was important.
Even when we had place for two people in the car.
Exactly..
This is the entire thing.
But his mind will never understand this because he's blindfolded by love.
God knows what that wretched girl has done to him that my son...
You called Zara wretched? Your daughter in law...
Whats wrong with you? What are you saying?
What should I say? I'll call her what she is.. Wretched.
Its the limit. I told you not to go there. I told you.
I had a dream. I knew there's be a problem if you go there. Do you see now?
There is the problem.
For God's sake mom.. Its enough.
I respect you, earn some respect.
Zara respects you like she respects her mother.
What do you mean?
You're threatening mom that you'll insult her? You'll not respect her
.
Whats wrong? Enough. Stop it.
No Mahi.. you didn't actually understand him. He is talking about that madam Zara.
He is trying to scare me that if I say anything bad to Zara, she'll misbehave with me and insult me.
And she'll make him hit me with shoes.
I will break off her hands.
If she even looks my mother in the eye..
Enough!
I've heard enough of what you've said. Not anymore.
Are you looking at him? Are you looking at his attitude?
He's lost his mind in love!
Mom.. he's right. Aunt called. She talked to me.
When I handed over the phone to you, you cut the call.
Shut your mouth. Shut up. You're not well.
The bandage is wrong. They should have bandaged her mouth.
You should have gotten an X-ray of her brain as well. Her nuts and bolts have become loose.
I'm telling the truth.
Shut up and eat your apple quietly.
My own children are ready to back stab me.
I'm really worried Saad.
Adeel told me that aunt and Mahi didn't like me but they actually hate me.
So what have you thought?
What can I think Saad, I don't understand.
Don't you think Maheen is right?
What if Adeel shifts here with you?
Saad, this isn't suitable. this will nurture more hatred.
They'll have a reason to hate me. Aren't you thinking about Adeel?
It will be difficult for him to leave his family for me. This isn't easy Saad.
And will Adeel tolerate whatever will happen in that house with you?
And you will also be leaving your parents and your family.
When you can leave, why can't he come?
Because its always the girl who leaves. They have to go.
Girls don't just go. Their in laws take them along lovingly but its different in your case.
And as it is, you get married to the boy, not her family.
Saad you're talking like Maheen now.
There's no option otherwise.
You only get to live once. If you don't take the right decision at the right time,
then you have to regret all your life.
I cannot live without Adeel.
Who is asking you to live without him?
But you can talk to him.
Has he ever turned you down?
Talk to him. He'll listen to you.
I'd say you should go and talk.
So much insult upon not calling.
I did call. I talked to Mirha after her accident.
Her mother didn't come on the phone. Then I called her again at night.
It kept ringing but she didn't answer. I thought she might be in the hospital.
Quite a few times there's a signal problem.
This means, she created the issue herself.
The actual thing is something else.
This is what I'm saying Shaista.
Nothing such had happened that Mahi and her mother created such a big scene.
Please don't mind but..
Its not Mirha's foot that was fractured but Fareeda's heart
and when there's a crack in a mirror or a heart, it just never goes.
Please don't cry, be quiet. If there is a problem, we'll find a way. If God wills. Be quiet.
My daughter is like a flower Shaista. What will become of her?
Don't worry. We're with you. In fact, don't worry.
Lets go and talk to Manzoor. Where is he? He'll find a solution.
He went to get rent for the shops.
Its another problem. The shopkeepers keep saying the market is slow,
they cannot manage rent. What can we do?
Should we just give away the shops for free? Where will we eat from? Problems are surrounding us..
Everything will be alright, don't cry.
My heart is just anxious. What can I do?
I want to know what you think, dear.
This is your life.
We'll not decide anything without your consent.
Don't take any pressure and tell me.
You've just signed the marriage contract for now.
Had you been living with him, I'd have said the same thing.
This marriage is a union of two families. We look into the boy's family as well.
You don't have to spend your life with Adeel only.
His family should also have a place for you in their hearts or else it'll be a problem.
Adeel has promised me dad. He will take care of me.
He'll not mistreat me because of his family.
So will Adeel's support be enough for you?
Tell me.
We need everything in life, dear.
Homes are built with relationships.
Mom says if your husband supports you, nothing else matters.
Whether someone else is with us.
The same thing happened with you and mom.
You've always supported mom.
You don't have any complaints against each other. We're all so happy, dad.
I'm your daughter.
I have learned to stay put. I promise you, dad.
You'll never get a chance to complain because of me.
If this is your final decision then,
don't make such a promise to me.
But instead, promise me that if there is any problem in that house, you'll complain to me. You'll tell me.
This is your house,
today, tomorrow and once you're married as well. You have a right on this house.
I'm your father.
I don't believe in shutting my door on my daughters once they get married.
You will not tolerate his family's mistreatment for your husband's love. Promise me this.
I promise you, dad. I'll do as you say.
I, want to discuss something with you.
Yes, tell me.
Dad, these matters will arise again. Before matters go worse, I want to settle everything.
I'll handle everything, dad.
Please get me married.
I have told dad to get me married, I'll handle everything else.
Did you tell him yourself?
Uncle would have minded it.
Why would he? I didn't say anything wrong.
Yes its not wrong but Zara, if girls talk about their weddings, people mind.
This is why I'm asking you.
Now tell me, did uncle say something to you?
He's my dad and I know him well.
He isn't that conservative, that's why I told him.
You shouldn't have talked directly. You should have told me and I'd have talked through dad.
And as it is, I had to talk to dad.
Adeel, you don't realize. Everybody was afraid here
and their fear was scaring me.
I felt someone might take a wrong decision.
Why would someone take a wrong decision, Zara.
This is our life.
We have the right to decide.
And if someone feels they can create distance between us with such cheap things, they're mistaken.
I will not let this happen, ever.
And even you know this.
Why are you afraid then?
See, don't be scared. I'm here. Everything will be alright.
Adeel, I've told dad that you've promised to stand by me and take care of me.
Then?
I will never be embarrassed in front of dad
and I'll never want dad to be embarrassed in front of me.
I will never think about anything else in front of my dad's respect.
Zara, why are you thinking all this? I'm here.
I'll fix everything. You don't have to think all this, while I'm here? Then..
Yes. I know it very well.
Now I'm getting late for office. I'll call you from there.
Sorry, I didn't realize. It was time for you to go.
Its okay. You go and work. Call me if you get time or else we'll talk at night.
No. I'll call you. I have to talk to you.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Its the limit mom. You're cooking peas and rice here and there, Zara is doing everything.
Why?
What happened? What did she do?
She talked to her dad that she couldn't wait anymore and he should get her married.
Oh God... May God's wrath be on her... She said this? To her own father?
Mahi... what age is this? Girls have become so bold? 
Will they now ask their parents to get them married?
Sorry to say but this is being shameless and not bold.
And I have just heard about her being shameless with my own ears. 
She was telling Adeel about what she did.
What did he say then?
What did Adeel say?
What would he say? He's getting his heart's desire.
This means that Zara will be deciding when she's going to come to my house?
I mean, Adeel is my son. I'll decide when and how his wedding will be.
I'll talk to Adeel and Zara myself..
No mom. You don't have to talk to anyone, right now.
Why shouldn't I? 
She hasn't come to this house yet and she's taking decisions. How dare she?
Mom, I'm not telling you not to talk. But this isn't the right time. 
Let aunt talk to Adeel then you can say whatever you want.
They don't have anything special that they'll talk to your dad about his daughter's wedding. 
Adeel will talk to your father and your father will talk to them about the wedding.
You don't understand.
They already have. Uncle told me that since my parents didn't come, they'd discuss the wedding with me.
Oh God.. now this will happen?
 What did you say? Why didn't you tell me?
 Why did they even talk to you about it?
They've killed me while I'm alive. They will now discuss weddings with the kids.
Your father is talking to you.. the girl is talking to the boy..Where am I in all this?
 Had you told me at that time, I'd have set them straight, really well.
See mom, I'm telling you. Its not the time to talk. 
Let aunt and uncle talk to you first. Why get dirty yourself?
They'll not talk.
Your father will talk and you'll see the wedding will take place. You can write it down.
They will talk.
They will ask themselves and fall down themselves. Write it down somewhere. This will happen.
Oh God.. Oh God.. What is happening?
Even I don't understand..
Nothing like this happened in my time. You were so strict.
This girl is a hurricane of disasters.
