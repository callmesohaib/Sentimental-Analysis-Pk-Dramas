I'm sure you know the difference between your husband and other men.
Auntie...
Why are you still standing here?
Did you not hear that her waiting period has begun? Leave this place.
You'd be doing me a favor by taking your daughter away from this home.
Brother, there is a difference between the environment of your home and mine.
If I can tolerate Adeel dying then I can tolerate anything.
When you come back don't come to meet me.
The weather is nice right?
Yes you're right.
Can we take a picture.
Sure, why not?
Try this angle.
I think you should take it from there.
You don't know how to take a selfie. You're supposed to hold it here.
Look at how good this picture is.
It's really good. I don't know how girls take fifteen pictures in one go.
Zaini does the same.
It's because they don't have such a professional photographer. Look at this.
You're right. There is no one like you
You know what. The time we are spending together, it's precious.
I want to save it me forever.
Show me the picture.
 Very pretty. Can you take another one?
I think this is enough. Shall we walk now?
Okay, let's go.
What are you doing Zara?
Nothing.
I don't know what problem Maheen has with us. 
She tried so hard to take you away.
It's good that you didn't go.
I wanted to say something to you.
What is it?
We didn't realize that you loved Adeel so much.
Your family tried so hard but you didn't you go with them.
You're still here.
Today I realized that love is the biggest thing.
I wanted to say that...
I said a lot of things about you.
Things I shouldn't have said.
I don't know whether if it was our love for Adeel or the rivalry our families had.
What are you trying to say?
What I want to say is to forget about the past.
I don't want you to feel anything bad for us and I don't want us to have any complaints about you. 
Even if we do, we shouldn't mention it to each other.
Adeel wanted this as well. 
He wanted us all to live together.
Like how all families live. All good families.
What's the matter? Did I say something wrong?
No you didn't, but maybe the time is wrong.
We could have done all this when Adeel was alive, when he was with us.
We could have given him this happiness while he was alive.
That's all that Adeel wanted.
You're right.
But Zara it's still not too late.
Better late than never.
That's the least we can do.
Right?
Stop worrying about me Saad.
In front of Adeel's sadness, everything seems small.
If I can tolerate Adeel dying, then I can tolerate everything.
When you return...
don't come to meet me.
Saad.
Yes?
What are you thinking?
I can see that you have been silent for a while. Say something,
What should I say?
Is there anything left for me to say?
Are you worried for me Zaini?
Yes.
I am worried looking at you. I've never seen you silent like this before.
Did you have the food sent to the madrassa?
Yes I did.
You should have told the kids to pray for my son.
Children are near God. There is no envy in their hearts.
Their prayers are accepted.
Prayer is the only thing that we can do.
My dear, ask Zara for tea as well.
I did. She refused.
She's very sad. All of us need to take care of her.
I asked her to come down and sit with us, but she didn't.
Why would she sit with us? 
What does she think of us? We are her enemies.
No mother it's not like that, she's only being like that because she's worried.
I understand your nature mother. But if Zara hears she would not like it.
Fareeda, Zara is my niece.
She has been widowed.
She's in great pain.
Right now she needs all of us.
It would be better if you remove all hatred in your heart.
And if you can't do that then tell me.
I will take her to her father's home.
Father, your tea.
Forget it. I've had it already.
Make your mother understand that I will tolerate any sort of cruelty towards Zara.
Drink.
Zara.
I'm taking this with me.
If you keep looking at this picture you won't get better.
I know...
what it is like to lose someone.
But we have to take care of ourselves.
Think of it like that.
Sister... what are you thinking?
You're missing brother Adeel, right?
I know you miss brother Adeel... he must miss you as well.
That's how loving people are. 
We miss them and they miss us.
People who love live in a different world then those who don't believe in love.
Do you know what love is?
Everyone knows what love is.
People who love know what love and people who become obstacles in it's way, know what love is.
You can talk about brother Adeel with me.
I'm the only one who can understand your feelings in this house.
No one else.
You have to have faith for brother Adeel.
What? Why are you staring at me like that?
Why are you so sympathetic towards her?
Do whatever you want mother.
I will not stop you. But if she leaves because of you...
then don't come crying to me. Why don't you understand?
She is not helpless.
 There are many people who support her.
She has many supporters. Maybe you didn't hear father. 
He said that he will take her there himself.
I lost my son because of that girl.
I cannot tolerate when they talk about him like that.
I don't like her at all.
So what? Should we use that as an excuse to hurt ourselves?
He was not only your son, he was my brother as well.
Ask me how I feel.
You don't know. 
This is the only reason why I've extended my friendship towards her.
Alright fine, do whatever you want.
Don't expect it from me. Extend your friendship...
but don't ask me to do it.
If you want to remove her...
then you have to grab her first.
Now it's up to you if you want to do it with a frown or a smile. But you have to do it.
Please try and understand.
I will take revenge from Zara. 
I need to take revenge from Maheen as well.
For my insult.
And my brother's death.
I will not let her leave this house so easily. 
I will not tolerate any foolishness.
I hate these people. I will oust Zara from this house.
Do you know...
I have taken away Adeel's picture from her room.
Bit by bit I'll remove everything.
Whatever Adeel gave her...
I'll take it away from her.
I will not leave anything for her.
Not even Adeel's memories.
Do you understand?
She wants to control her and through him she wants to control us and this house.
Learn from her. 
What could be a better way to rule over her husband's heart?
To love his family and his home! What's so wrong with it?
Uncle?
May I come in?
Please come in. You don't need my permission.
Thank you.
Uncle, did you have something for me?
My dear, I didn't see you since morning. I was waiting for you to come outside.
I wanted to see you...
and I wanted to talk to you.
Please sit down.
Come sit with me.
My dear, I wanted to say something to you.
Don't take what Fareeda says to heart.
She's forced by her nature.
When she opposes something she says whatever that comes to heart.
My dear, I've been seeing you since you were a child.
I'm aware of your health and I know...
that you are sensitive.
I've heard what Fareeda said after Adeel's death.
My dear, please don't cry.
You have to make yourself strong. I came here to tell you...
to not concentrate on what Fareeda said.
My dear, this life is very long, it's harsh...
You'll be tested. 
You'll have to listen and tolerate a lot of things.
Make yourself strong.
Remember one thing...
I will always be with you.
Until I'm alive. I will not leave you alone to fight this world.
But you have to do one thing...
don't cry.
Don't cry, because you know... that a daughter's pain...
is like poison.
We still have our lives in front of us...
We still have to live in this world.
Without Adeel.
I don't understand what happened. 
Why didn't Zara come here, I was waiting for her.
You shouldn't have waited for her. 
She does as she likes and that's why she didn't come.
Because she didn't want to come.
Maheen.
She wanted to come, I'm sure brother Ahmed must have asked her to stay.
Brother Ahmed has all of a sudden become more important than us.
Maheen, you are being rude.
Really! then tell me one thing?
why do we listen to everything she says in this house?
We married her right after her engagement. I was the only one who opposed it...
but no one listened to me. Now you realize...
that I was right. 
You guys have left her in that hell because she didn't want to come back.
And still everyone is angry at me. Why is that?
Why is everyone upset at me? What do you all want from me?
Talk about it and let me know. Because from now on I will not speak in any matter.
She doesn't listen to anyone. She does whatever she wants.
Forget it sister... she's worried for her sister.
Dolly.
Yes mother?
Serve dinner if it's ready.
Everyone must be hungry. Once you guys wash up I'll serve it.
Alright my dear, call Maheen as well.
Sure.
Forget her my dear, she'll eat when she's hungry.
Her father has already spoiled her, she acts as though she is my mother.
I'll have dinner served.
Forget it sister, don't be angry. Change your clothes.
I'll serve dinner.
Father.
I don't have any strength left in me.
When I think about Zara I feel worried.
I feel very weak.
Father, you've always given us strength, then why are you sounding so hopeless now?
Now matter how strong a father is...
he breaks when he sees his daughters sad.
Father, don't be worried about what sister said. You know how emotional she is.
All her words can do is arise suspicion in our hearts, 
but her words aren't the truth.
You're the one who says that no one can change their fate.
When tough times come one has to walk through it.
But they should understand that whatever happened wasn't Zara's fault.
They are torturing her.
Pray that it doesn't happen again.
You should talk to Zara, she will surely listen to you.
She would have...
But not from her heart. 
I fear something bad might happen to her there.
It was a hard decision to leave Zara there.
Pray that God creates ease for your sister.
Amen.
Uncle, Zaini dinner is served.
Sure, we'll be right there... 
please come with us, you haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
Please come on.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I can't decide what color to wear.
You don't understand. Let me select.
Look at this.
This one will suit you.
It's good...
but isn't it a little dark?
It's dark? Let's look at some other option.
Uh... look at this. I think this one...
will suit you.
Wait... I think that one there...
it will suit you. This one!
This one will suit you.
Alright.
Just a second. I think that one there would look perfect on you.
See... this will look perfect on you. Made for you.
Do you know what the problem is... 
no matter what color you wear you will look wonderful.
I don't know which one to pick.
Isn't that too much?
What do you mean?
Haven't you heard the phrase, you should wear clothes as per the color not the season.
So you know poetry as well... now don't start singing it,
What do you mean? I sing so well.
Yes you do... you sing so well...
that I can't hear it. I don't have a habit of hearing such a good voice.
So get used to it.
When one day I'm not with you...
then my voice will make you realize that I'm near you.
If you're worried about me being upset, then why do you do things that I don't like?
Because I can't listen to everything you say. 
You should be happy.
Our soon to be daughter-in-law already thinks that this house is hers. 
Before we arrived, our house was clean and dinner was cooked.
That was only for Ali. All she wants to do is control Ali and through him control this house.
Learn from her. What could be a better way to rule her husband's heart?
To take care of her family and his home. What's so wrong with it?
Love should be present between relationships in a household.
You are acting like a politician.
Listen to one thing... if this house belongs to someone after me...
then that's my daughter-in-law, understand?
And if you want to rule over some place, then go to your husband's house.
Hamza... what's the matter? If everything alright?
No mother... there is a bad news.
May God have mercy, what happened?
Zara... her husband has passed away.
From God we come and to Him we must return.
But how did this happen?
Do you remember the accident on the news that day...
Adeel died in that accident.
What about Zara? Is she alright?
Yes... my God's good grace she survived.
Thank God.
Mother, if you could call Maheen and...
I will... but first tell me, how did you find out? Who told you?
Ali did. He called and told me that they returned today.
Maheen should have been the one to call and notify you.
But she's so stubborn, that even this accident taught her no lesson.
Ali, where are you going?
Where do you want to send me?
Nowhere.
I don't want you to go anywhere. Not even Islamabad.
I have to go to Islamabad. Islamabad won't come to me here.
So you can't leave Islamabad for me? Is it that hard?
Dolly, shall we go home?
No brother, we'll stay here for a few days.
Alright... I understand.
No... it's nothing like that. Everyone is so worried.
I don't feel like leaving everyone.
Alright fine. I'll take mother with me.
No brother, who will take care of mother at home?
Mother will stay with me here.
That means that Saad will have to stay here as well.
I'm here most days.
But some people don't like it.
Let them feel bad. It makes no difference to us.
Look at uncle and auntie's condition.
 We can't leave them alone and this is my home now.
Forget about this, I'll get going.
Take care of yourself and mother.
Farewell.
Be careful on your way home.
Dolly, I have to go to Islamabad.
I'll try to wrap things up quickly. But for now I'll have to go.
Come in
Zara... I was thinking that if you stay in your room you'll remain worried.
If you start doing some chores it will distract you.
Do you understand?
Alright.
I'm saying this only for you... for your well being.
Otherwise chores were done in this house before you.
But I'm saying this only for your distraction.
When did I refuse?
You cannot refuse, I'm saying this for you.
What should I make for dinner?
Make whatever you want.
I'll help you out. We'll make dinner together.
I can manage alone.
You're refusing my offer. I can help you.
But I can understand. Some people have a habit of working alone. 
Maybe you are one of them.
Anyways, I won't disturb you anymore. If you need anything else let me know.
Okay...
