My God, what did you do Mahi?
What will I say to Ahmed now?
Fareeda?
How's Zara and how did this happen?
How do I know? I went inside the kitchen and saw Zara on the floor.
I've told you a thousand time not to let Zara go inside the kitchen.
Where was Mahi at the time?
Mahi... she had a fever since morning. She didn't even leave her room.
Ahmed...
Will Zara get better?
Nothing will happen to Adeel, right?
Just pray for her Fareeda.
Let me tell you one thing. If anything bad happens to Zara...
then I will not forgive anyone.
What did I do? What have I done to Zara?
I didn't want this.
No, nothing will happen to her.
I didn't shove her.
I was just trying to get her out of the way and she fell.
Yes, why am I being afraid?
I didn't do anything.
I shouldn't be afraid.
Nothing will happen, she's fine. The baby will be fine too.
Sister...
Yes?
Father called.
How's Zara?
She had a miscarriage.
What?
How are you feeling now?
My dear don't cry.
Maybe this is what God wanted.
Zara, control yourself. You need to be strong right now.
She's right. Control yourself.
Doctor, how long will it take for her to get discharged.
We are keeping her under observation.
We'll send her home as soon as she starts feeling better.
Alright. Thank you.
May God give your strength.
Thank God that you're here.
I was worried when your father told me that they weren't let you coming.
Yes mother. They didn't want me to leave the job.
But I gave my final decision to leave. Then they accepted my resignation.
Strange.
Brother, did you see the sherwani. Tell me how you like it.
Mother, you said that it was nice, but this isn't.
If you didn't like it, then we can have it changed.
What I mean to say that it's very nice!
You almost scared me!
Thank God!
I was scared as well.
If you guys are done, shall I talk about something important.
Sure, go ahead.
My dear, I don't Saad to be burdened, that's why I want to give some responsibility to Usama as well.
I don't think I need to ask you to help him.
Alright father, I'll take a look.
Saad shouldn't feel that he's alone.
I asked Zaini to take her clothes to Dolly's place and get ready there.
Shaista, Maheen and I will take care of things.
As you say mother.
No one will be burdened if we work together.
You did finalize the food right?
Yes I did. I had Saad talk to the catering people as well.
Good.
There is so much to do. One job ends and another one begins.
One ends and there's something else to do.
Brother Ahmed is calling as well.
Greetings brother Ahmed.
Before you arrived we...
What?
You are jealous of my happiness.
You don't want me to be happy.
Your sister and you planned against me.
Why did you do this to me?
Mahi, it's not like this... listen to me...
Don't you dare touch me... I hate you. I'm disgusted by you.
I hate your existence! Get out of my sight!
Auntie!
Sarwat please...
Why did this happen?
Why did this happen?
Control yourself.
Who has victimizing our happiness?
It's gone the moment it arrives.
I don't know what God wants.
I told you to bring her here. I asked you to not let them keep her.
I told you that they won't be able to take care of her.
But you didn't listen to me... look what they did to my daughter.
She stole my daughter's child from her.
Mother control yourself, you'll get sick.
How can I control myself?
Take me there... I want to see my daughter.
Take me to my daughter... what was my daughter's fault?
God gave my daughter one happiness and they stole it from her.
Yes we'll go... my son prepare, we'll leave today.
Sure father...
Go and get your mother ready.
Control yourself.
I talked to her a few days ago and she was fine.
Adeel is dead. You killed my Adeel!
Why did you do this? Why did you do this?
I swear to God I didn't do it on purpose.
I shoved her and she fell. I didn't do anything.
What face will I show to my son? How will I face Zara?
My son's last memory is gone because of you.
You killed my son's memory.
I made a mistake, please forgive me mother.
Mistake? Is you mistake worthy of forgiveness?
No it is not!
Still to save you I lied in front of your father.
Do you know what will happen...
if he learns the truth?
No mother...
You let your hatred consume you.
You didn't Zara to have a baby and stay in this house.
You did this on purpose, right? You did this on purpose.
No... Mahi... Zara didn't deserve this and you took revenge from her.
I made a grave mistake, forgive me.
What revenge did you take from her? You also took revenge from your mother.
You have killed me Mahi... you killed me!
How will show my face?
Forgive me mother...
What will I answer my son? How will I face Zara?
You did not think of this once. How can you be so cruel?
How can you be so cruel? I will never forgive you!
Saad...
Yes mother?
Are you doing something important.
It's not that important. What is it?
Yes... I kept this money aside for Dolly.
You can keep it for you work.
Mother I have money, I'll manage.
I know son... still keep it.
Mother, give this money to Dolly.
I don't need it. Besides, I've arranged for the money.
From where? I talked in my office to get an advanced salary.
The boss has approved it today
You don't need to worry about anything.
Everything will be taken care.
May God bless every mother with a son like you.
Mother....
Mother!
What happened?
Ali called... they are saying that Zara had a miscarriage.
What?
May God have mercy. How did this happen?
Let's go.
Let's go.
Uncle I should come along with you guys.
No son stay here. Zaini is here and Maheen will be here too.
You'll have to take care of everyone here.
Uncle, Zara will be in pain right now.
I understand that you are concerned for your friend.
We will bring her back.
Saad he's right. Ali is coming with us. You should stay.
Alright? Take care. Farewell.
Be safe on your travel sister.
Give Zara my love.
Mother.
Mother.
What happened? Is everything alright? How come you're back early from work?
I came early because I needed to drop Maheen at her mother's place.
What was so urgent that she called you back so early?
Umm... shall we go?
Will someone tell me what happened?
Zara had a miscarriage.
How?
I don't know. I wasn't able to talk much with mother. She was leaving for Hyderabad.
You should have told me this Maheen.
I was on my way to tell you.
Are you guys going to Hyderabad?
Zaini is at home alone right now...
Mother has asked us to stay there.
Hamza will you stay there as well?
No mother, I'll return after I drop her off?
Alright fine. Be careful... let's go.
Zara.
Say something my dear.
I've been sitting here with you for a while.
I'm trying to talk to you but you aren't answering.
I know your pain is big.
I know that you are shocked. It's not easy to lose one's child.
I...
I have gone through this pain that's why I understand how you feel.
But...
Say something Zara.
I'm saying this because I've lost my son.
I don't want to lose Mahi.
You know your uncle.
If he learn the truth...
then he would never have forgiven Mahi.
You understand what I'm saying, right?
I know this is unjust... still I'm asking you...
to forgive Mahi.
I know it's very hard for you.
She has caused you a great deal of pain.
It's good to forgive.
And you are among those who forgive. You've forgiven me as well.
I was so unjust to you.
You forgave me, right?
Zara...
For your uncle... for this life... forgive her.
If he learns the truth he won't be able to tolerate it... I know...
She won't be able to.
First...
He already has the pain of losing his son.
He's still shocked about Mahi marriage breaking.
And then... this happened to you.
I don't want...
He won't be able to withstand it.
Zara... do you understand what I'm saying, right?
Look at this... I beg you.
Don't tell your uncle and your family anything.
For God's sake don't tell them.
All of them...
Your uncle won't be able to withstand it.
Mahi was cruel with you.
I too was cruel with you.
Forgive Mahi.
Forgive her for Adeel.
You forgave me as well... if your uncle finds out he'll die.
Forgive her!
Forgive her!
Do you think that if you hang out with a girl...
then no one will find out.
What nonsense is this? What girl?
What kind of nonsense are you saying?
Nonsense...
You know that I'm not speaking nonsense.
I have a headache. I need a cup of tea.
Why are you upstairs? Zaini must be alone downstairs.
No... Maheen is here...
Saad will be returning after dropping sister Asifa.
Oh, so he's here as well.
What happened to Zara was a tragedy. It shouldn't have happened.
I don't understand you.
When you heard the good news you stated that it shouldn't have happened.
Now that tragedy has struck her, you're saying that this shouldn't have happened to her.
What do you want?
It's just something I said... how could I have known that this would happen?
What happened to that girl is terrible and it shouldn't have happened.
I'm sad as well, but one begs to wonder how this happened.
I suspect Zara's sister-in-law, she's the one who did this.
What are you saying? It makes no sense.
I've seen the world... I can tell what someone's thinking just by taking a look at them.
I've been noticing Mahi for a long time now.
Do you remember how many hurdles she created during Zara's marriage?
What about what she did with Maheen? Have you forgotten?
Adnan, all of that is in the past.
She couldn't have done something like that now.
Because that child was her brother's last memory.
No everything is how it seems.
And I'm sure that what I'm thinking is right.
Anyways...
Brother Manzoor and sister have gone there. We'll learn the truth soon enough.
I'll get going.
Where are you going?
I'm going for a walk. What else will I do after eating?
Let me eat this... he has a habit of leaving food behind.
Hey! Didn't you go? I thought you would go running there.
I don't want to talk to you right now.
What's the matter? I was just checking up on you and you're being rude.
I don't want you checking up on me!
Why are you always so angry at me? What did I ever do to you?
Are you leaving, or should I?
I'll leave..
My path is clear ahead, but I'm worried about you.
You're path is full of hurdles and I was thinking of clearing it up.
I don't understand
You will very soon.
Stay in  your limits.
Again with your anger. Why are you always so angry?
Restrict your vile thinking to yourself. I know how vile you are.
What are you saying? What did I do?
What you've done? Do you think..
that if you would hangout with a girl...
that no one will find out.
What nonsense is this? What girl?
You are speaking nonsense.
Nonsense?
You know that I'm not speaking nonsense.
I'm warning you one last time,
if you ever say something in front of me again, I won't take a second exposing you.
This is your last warning.
Correct yourself.
I'll be the one to correct you.
Zara.
I'm here.
Everything will be alright my dear.
Enough my dear...
Enough...
How did this happen?
I handed my daughter to you guys. How did this happen?
I understand your pain Sarwat
Believe me, I feel the same pain of losing Adeel's last memory.
No sister Fareeda.
No one among us can even begin to feel my daughter's pain.
A tragedy has befallen Zara.
What more will she have to face at her age?
How will she deal with this sadness?
Sarwat... control yourself.
Sarwat... I have wronged you.
I was the one who promised you that I will take care of Zara.
I couldn't fulfill my promise again.
Forgive me.
I beg in front of you two.
I want to take Zara with me.
Alright Sarwat.
Take her with you.
She's your daughter and you're her mother.
You will be take better care of her.
Take her... I won't stop you.
I'm warning you one last time.
If you dare say anything in front of me, I won't lost a second exposing you.
You'll find messing with me very costly Saad.
You don't what I can do. You've placed your hand in snake's den.
It's hard for you to get away now.
Zara, come with us.
Don't ask me to leave you here.
Auntie, father is calling you.
Sure.
Sure... I'll see what he's saying.
Zara...
I know that you are angry at me.
But I swear I didn't do it on purpose. I was just angry.
Go away from here.
Listen to me...
I said leave!
Zara....
Mother...
Mother! Auntie!
Get up... mother!
What happened! My God...
I was speaking and she started feeling pain.
Pain?
Auntie, call a doctor, quickly!
Sure.
I'll call one right away. Don't worry Zara, I'll call a doctor.
She's calling a doctor. What happened my dear?
Hurry up!
Ask Ali to bring the doctor here.
It hurts!
Doctor what happened to her?
There's nothing to worry about. I've given her some painkillers.
In a while she'll feel better.
Why did she start feeling pain again?
This happens under her condition.
 Let her be on complete bed rest and keep her away from stress.
Doctor, we want to take her to Karachi.
Sorry, I can't allow that under condition.
 She's in no condition to travel.
I'll write some medicines, give them to her on time.
I'll escort you outside doctor.
Okay...
Thank you doctor.
Mother shouldn't have gone there alone. She should have taken me there.
What would you have done there?
I would have asked them why they did this to Zara.
Whatever happened to Zara had nothing to do with them.
Instead of talking about this, pray for Zara.
Why does things always come back to me?
No they don't.
Rather, you always say things that don't matter.
You are speaking unnecessarily.
You two fighting won't solve Zara's problems.
Saad, is Zara coming back or not?
Zara isn't coming.
What?
What? Why isn't she coming?
Even after what happened she wants to stay there.
Zara isn't well, the doctor has asked her not to travel.
Then we should extend the marriage as well.
You can talk to uncle once he comes back.
What happened to him?
What do you mean? You're talking about postponing his sister's wedding.
His bound to be upset.
A tragedy is befallen my sister and he's worried about his sister's wedding.
Please don't assume. Let mother and father come back, they'll make the right decision.
Please... don't involve Saad in your matters.
There is no need to react so much Maheen.
Mother... here's the medicine.
Are you okay?
Why are you so silent?
Why don't you tell me what's in your heart.
Nothing seems nice.
It feels as though my life has been turned upside down.
I thought that after Adeel...
I would not live my life alone.
This child would become like Adeel.
He would be with me.
He's gone now
How will I live without him now?
May God give you patience.
All of us are with you.
What happened my dear... how did you fall?
I was paying attention.
I hit something and fell.
I didn't realize that I would lose so much.
May God create ease for you.
Zara, it's only a few more days...
then we'll take you away from here.
And if you want, we can take you away from here.
Then maybe...
I won't get the chance again.
I want to spend my sadness with Adeel's memory.
Give me a few days.
Then I'll do as you say. I'll listen to everything you say...
