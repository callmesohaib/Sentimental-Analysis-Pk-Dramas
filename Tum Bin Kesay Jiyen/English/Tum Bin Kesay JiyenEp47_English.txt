What are you saying, Zaini?
Something I haven't said until today. I have to say it today.
Why did you do it, Saad?
Zaini, this isn't true.
Whatever we have seen, how will you say its a lie?
How will you say its a lie, Saad? I've always asked you..
But you never told me the truth.
Even when I asked you, you never told me the truth.
At least, tell me the truth now.
Listen to me. Its nothing like what you've heard or seen.
Whatever Saad is saying is the truth.
What should I hear? I don't want to listen anything.
He has always given my rights to you. He gave you the time I deserved.
He got engaged to me because you told him to.
He cared for me because you said so.
This is because he loves you truly.
I don't want a love I have to beg for.
And Saad..
Saad has never loved me.
Because you have always been between us. You called him whenever you got a chance.
What relationship did you have with him?
Zaini, he's my friend.
Friend?
It isn't friendship when you forget everything.
Even the man whose name is attached to yours.
What right do you have to advocate for him? What right?!
Zaini, how are you talking to Zara?
This.. this is love. This is what is called love.
This is love.
I talked to Zara in a loud tone, he spoke up in her defense.
And what about my broken heart?
Can't you see that?
Zaini, you're wrong.
All of us are wrong here. Just the two of you are right.
I'm your sister. How can you accuse me of something so dirty?
You're not my sister. You could never be my sister.
Rather than having a sister like you, it would have been better if you had died the day Adeel died.
Zaini!
Saad!
How dare you touch my sister?
Can't you see how she's talking to Zara?
Saad before something really bad happens.. leave from here. Leave!
Brother.. did anyone named Usama come here?
No. Nobody named Usama came here.
Alright.
Is there any signal issue here?
No signal issue usually but I've heard the signals have been weak today.
If your car isn't here, please sit inside. I'll inform you.
No brother. I'll go on a rickshaw myself. No problem.
I'll call a rickshaw for you.
Thank you.
No brother. I'll go on a rickshaw myself. No problem.
I'll call a rickshaw for you.
Thank you.
Whats happening here?
sister, thank God you're here. Please tell everyone that there is nothing between me and Saad and he's doing everything.
What? What did you say? Between you and Saad?
I'll tell you.
Saad has destroyed your younger sister's life and he has tainted Zara for life.
He has been keeping a bad eye on the girls in our house and now..
when we have seen everything with our eyes, we believe it now.
Saad? Is all this true?
Maheen, trust me.. Can I do anything like this?
Dad, listen to Saad once. What if he's telling the truth?
So is Adnan lying?
I'm not talking to you. Can you be quiet for a while?
Why should I be quiet?
Your sister is accusing my husband of something so sordid.
She said that he had kept a dirty eye on her. She should have drowned before accusing him.
And should I just be quiet and listen to her accuse my husband.
Should I see a spectacle being made. Why couldn't she die before making such a big scene?
Shaista, be quiet. For God's sake everyone be quiet.
What is happening? Will someone tell me?
Why is Saad being accused?
I'll tell you whats going on.
She has been having an affair with Saad since long and today Adnan caught them red handed.
Maheen, this is a lie. There's nothing like this.
Your husband is a liar. He's a cheap man.
He distanced Zaini from me as well.
You should be quiet!
You have embarrassed me in front of everyone, Saad.
Is this how you pay me back for my love?
You have left me unable to show my face to anyone.
I treated him like my son.
I trusted him more than myself and he deceived me.
The one I thought was loyal to my house and its savior,
he turned out to be my enemy.
Uncle..
I'm not like this..
Quiet.
Zaini
You tell me. Is this all true?
Why did you do it? Why?
If you still don't believe me, I have proof.
Look at that.
Mom.. this
Come mom.. the food is hot. I'll give you your medicine once you eat.
Let Saad come and we'll eat together.
Isn't he back yet? He is usually back by now. He's late.
Did he go to Zara's?
I don't know but if he does go, he messages me.
I feel anxious.
Where is he trapped?
Mom, where would he be? There's so much traffic. You know they could get late.
Hmm.. call him and ask where he is.
His phone is switched off.
God, where is my son?
Mom, why are you worried? Nothing will happen. You have dinner then you need your medicine as well.
Brother will come back home. Where else will he go?
Here mom.. your tea.
You made so much..
Drink it and let me know how it is.
Alright.
Hello mom.
Hello. Shehla why are you all alone? Where is Usama?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know? I told him to pick you up once he drops Maheen.
I called brother but his number is switched off so I came home myself.
He isn't so careless.
Let it be mom. He went with Maheen.. How could he remember?
Alright. We'll ask him once he's back
Let it be. They went after so many days.
What is this? He can go wherever he wants but they should tell me.
Give me my phone. I'll ask where he is.
Now, do everything later. Give me something to eat.
I had been at the salon since morning. I'm hungry now.
Everything is ready. Freshen up and come. I'll serve.
Sawera, get me my phone. I'll ask where they are.
I'll go get it.
Now tell me. Was everything done well?
What will happen now?
We'll be ridiculed Saad. What did you do, dear?
Aunty..
Don't call me aunty.
What will I answer people who already doubted your relation? Tell me.
You proved all of them right.
Mom..
Please don't say that. How can you even think that, mom?
Mom, I didn't do anything. Trust me, please.
I trusted you very much Zara. Both of you.
You didn't even think about your sister. And you, Saad?
You didn't think you had two relationships with this house? Your sister will be coming here.
Aunty, please listen to me.
What should I hear?
My years old trust has died today. What should I hear?
Saad has been accused.
And now I want a way for Saad to stop coming here.
And there is one way for that.
Saad's relationship with this house should end.
This is the only way, Saad's entry in this house will be blocked.
Your phone.
Give it to me.
I'll ask him.
Where are you?
Mom, actually I came to Maheen's house.
Didn't I tell you, you had to pick Shehla?
Mom.. it skipped my mind. But don't worry. I'll go and get her right away.
Let it be. She's home.
Mom, actually we didn't plan to come here. It was sudden. I'm very sorry.
Now do you intend to come back home or will you be staying there?
We'll be back in a while.
Alright. Bye.
Yes.
Whose call was it?
Mom's.
Actually I had to pick Shehla from the salon but it skipped my mind.
So, are you leaving now?
No. She's home. But she's home and mom's upset now.
So will you go?
Why?
aren't you coming along?
No. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.
Alright.
How is Zaini now?
Zaini.. her room is locked and she isn't opening the door.
I don't understand. What should I do?
And Zara is still supporting Saad.
I'm so worried. I don't believe whatever is happening.
Yes. Even I don't understand anything
I'll go and look at Zaini.
What happened mom? Is everything alright?
Yes it is.
Then why aren't they here yet?
They are at his in laws. His sister's engagement is round the corner and he's sitting with his in laws.
Leave it mom. Let it be. She has visited her house after so many days. Its nothing.
You're always supporting her and it is this reason why your brother is getting agitated by us.
Whats wrong mom? Its nothing. You think about it.
In fact, Usama has become more considerate towards us now and Maheen..
Mom, Sawera is absolutely right.
Why do you burn your blood thinking about it?
Let it be.. I'll tell you a very interesting story about what happened in the salon..
Uncle please make aunty understand. What is wrong with all of you?
Why are you believing this outsider and not me?
Adnan, isn't an outsider, Saad.
Then who am I aunty? Who am I?
Am I a stranger?
You called me your son and you made me a stranger in a minute.
Aunty I just have Zaini in my heart. Nobody else.
Zara is my friend.
I have always seen her as my friend. I've always supported her.
She was worried today and I couldn't hold back and you're doubting us.
You have no proof of whatever you're saying
and even Zaini said you were involved with Zara.
We found out today but Zaini has been tolerating everything since day one.
Brother..
Please stop it. Don't you feel ashamed thinking such a pathetic thing?
What else can we do?
Both of you haven't let us able to show our face to anyone.
You've insulted us in the society.
Brother we'll have to decide something. We can't let him go like this.
I don't want to make tall claims but you should call his family
and tell them how much we've been ridiculed. We cannot accept this ridicule ourselves.
The way he has gotten our daughter ridiculed.
Call his mother and call off this engagement.
We cannot get our daughter married to such a man.
Mom.. what is he saying?
How can you give him such rights? Why don't you say something? Mom!!
Mom!
What are you doing?
I'm leaving from here.
Where are you going?
Wherever I can but I will not stay here. You..
how can you trust Adnan uncle?
Its not about Adnan anymore. Didn't you hear what Zaini said?
You didn't listen to your sister?
You never knew what your sister felt?
You never saw.
Then Saad isn't the only one at fault. You were always his accomplice.
My sister in law was right.
My upbringing lacked something.
Mom, all this isn't true.
And as far as Zaini is concerned, I'll talk to Zaini myself. She is also mistaken.
I'll clear her misunderstanding but please don't call off their engagement. You'll wrong them.
You never thought about your sister's relationship earlier.
You're not trusting your daughter but you trust that guy.
The man whom I've told you many times that he isn't a good guy.
He looks at me with weird eyes and he has tried to hold my hand a couple of times.
And that day, in the store.. he crossed all limits.
I'm warning you. Don't you dare say such a sordid thing.
Alright mom. Its over then.
When its all my fault and everything happened because of me, why don't you let me go?
I'm leaving mom. Its my fault. Everything happened because of me.
I'll leave.
But please don't do this to Saad. He didn't do anything. Its not his fault.
Mom, we'll do what we have to do ourselves but you'll not take a step out of this house.
Your dad will take all decisions
Stop with this drama. Come down, your dad is calling you.
Mom..
Brother Manzoor, being silent won't do anything. You need to decide.
What can we decide?
Its not so easy to call off the engagement
No matter what you decide.. I'll always be with you.
I'll forget everything and stand with you.
I trust you completely.
Then what are you going to decide?
We will not get our Zaini married to a guy whose already shady..
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Its my life and I'll not let anybody else decide.
So what can we do?
When I know everything, I'll not get my daughter married to you.
I'll never accept this accusation. Its a lie.
Saad, things have gone further than whats true and whats false.
Give me a chance at least.
I did give you a chance.
Why should we give you a chance?
So that you can get us insulted again?
Don't interfere.
Why shouldn't I interfere?
You falsely accused me and I shouldn't even interrupt.
If someone had seen your true face, I'd..
Did you see Manzoor? Did you see? He is threatening me in front of you.
He tried to hit me earlier and now..
Enough!
Don't get me ridiculed in front of the world anymore.. I have no more strength.
Uncle.. I've always taken you as my father. I cannot lie to you.
Its my fault Saad. I treated you like my son.
I put my daughter's happiness in your lap but
I didn't know you'd let me down like this.
Uncle..
You murdered relationships mercilessly.
Uncle I swear. Zara is my friend, nothing else.
Let me meet Zaini, once. You people don't believe me, alright. But Zaini will trust me.
Let me meet her once. I'll not let you call off the engagement like this. Let me meet her once uncle.
You cannot meet Zaini.
Ali.. please, let me meet Zaini once. I'll make her understand.
See, Saad. I have honor. I've already seen one of my sisters destroyed by you,
I won't let it happen to the other one.
Ali please. Let me meet Zaini once.
There's nothing to make her understand.
You'll never be able to meet Zaini again.
Please let me meet her once. Just once.
Enough.
I think you should leave from here. Come with your mother and sister.
We'll discuss everything with them.
Why don't you people believe me? Don't be so harsh.
You're doing wrong trusting this cheap man.
NCheap man? Am I the one? I have done everything?
Mansoor, he never wanted to have this engagement.
Do you remember when we wanted to get Ali married to Dolly..
We talked about their wedding as well and he said no using job as an excuse.
But now I know why he said no to it.
Don't take things in another dimension. Everybody knows why I said no at that time.
Everything came out clearly today. Before this, you had been fooling us.
Are you saying this?
Yes Saad. I'm saying this. You forced us for all this.
Its my fault..
I trusted you. I allowed you inside my house.
There were no prohibitions whether it was day or night.
People told me that we shouldn't trust strangers but I did..
Its not entirely your fault, Manzoor.
Even I'm at fault. I should have kept an eye.
Everybody told me..
Its not good that a sister in law is so friendly with her brother in law.
But I never saw them that way. If I had, we wouldn't have seen this day.
Who can we blame? Our own daughter was at fault.
She ridiculed us in front of the entire world.
You people are doing wrong. With us.
Zara.. you say something please.
Make them understand. Ask them to let me meet Zaini once. Make them understand
Leave me.
Nobody will understand us. Nobody. Can't you see?
Didn't I tell you to not come meet me? Not talk to me. Didn't I say?
What happened Saad? You told me everyone will believe me.
But everybody believes uncle. Nobody even listened to me.
I told you not to tell them anything. You said they'd support me. Did they support me?
What happened Saad? I'm a spectacle now.
Zara..
Do you even know how much pain I am in? I'm being accused for breaking my sister's house.
Whatever is happening, I'm being accused for it.
And the accusations that have been made to me.. everybody blames them now.
Zara, please don't cry. I cannot see you crying.
What are you doing Saad?
You're still sympathizing with me?
Whatever happened is because you sympathized with me.
Why don't you understand?
Zara...
Stop this drama.
If you respect us even a little, leave or else I'll do something.
Leave!
brother Manzoor..
Whats happening to you? Dear, come here and help you dad. Please sit..
Oh God..
I never thought Saad would be like this.
I told you earlier but you never listen to me.
How would I know? I didn't dream that Saad would be like this.
Whats wrong? Haven't you seen them together yourself so many times?
I did but I never thought things would be so bad. 
What will become of Zaini? I'm so worried about her.
Nothing will happen with Zaini. I'm here. I'll think what needs to be done.
Why have you thought? Brother Manzoor will think about them. 
You don't need to have any thoughts.
Stay as far away from this matter as possible. Don't harbor animosity without a reason.
I've harbored animosity and I've waged a war. Now I need to end it.
What did you say?
Nothing. I'll tell you later whatever I said.
Its the limit.
What happened? Where are you running?
I'm going to get the doctor. Please sit with dad for sometime
Oh my God. What happened to my brother?
Nothing aunt. He just has a little high blood pressure.
I'll come with you.
No. I'll go.
Its all because of Saad.
Otherwise, how could my brother get sick all of a sudden..
Whats wrong with you? He's worried and you're talking about Saad..
Alright. I'll leave.
Yes dear. Get the doctor fast.
Why do you have to talk about Saad?
I just mentioned it. You're stretching it now. You say whatever you want to.
Alright come. Lets look at your brother.
This had to happen.
Are you in your senses? You could have died in an accident.
Its better if I had died.
Wow.. what are you saying? Are you in your senses.
Don't do it.
Sorry.. I didn't know when your car came in front of me.
If you had died, your family would have blamed me.
Let him go.
Alright. God knows where they come from to die in the middle of the road.
Be careful.. Try..
Are you hurt anywhere?
Be careful..
Its alright. Sorry.
Zaini.. Zaini please listen to me.
I don't want to listen anything. Please leave
Zaini, its a misunderstanding.
How long should I be in this misunderstanding?
Whatever you heard isn't true.
Then what is the truth? You.. me.. Me or you.. Whose side is Saad on?
Is he on my side or yours?
Zaini, Saad is yours and he'll always be yours.
Stop it. Stop telling fake stories.
Zaini, don't be so harsh on yourself and on me.
Whats wrong with you?
 I'm the one who has lost everything.
You can stop everyone from doing this.
Saad is only yours. He loves you. Whatever is happening is part of a plan.
Plan?
What plan?
Adnan uncle.. why don't you understand?
Another lie? 
Another accusation. Stop it Zara.
To hid your sin, how low will you stoop?
Enough Zaini. I didn't commit any sin.
 Its all because of Adnan uncle. He planted doubt in everybody's heart, for Saad and for me.
He loves you. He's yours. 
He wants to talk to you. Talk to him and save your relationship. If you don't talk to him.
Adnan uncle will succeed and everything will be destroyed.
 Your engagement with Saad will be called off. Why don't you understand Zaini?
