He's his fiance, it's his right.
This would only increase their chemistry which is good for their future.
But Saad's friendship with Zara is...
quite weird.
That's what I said to brother.
I don't like it at all.
My God! Twenty five lac rupees.
What will they do with this hefty sum of money?
Firstly they will go on their honeymoon.
They can do whatever they want.
She is repeating what she said there.
She wanted me to see Zara's face...
I saw her face when we got married. We married her according to her choice.
What's her problem?
Enough sister, why are you being angry?
Sir... please buy these flower bangles. It's two hundred a pair.
I need to buy medicine for my mother.
Sure.
For you.
Thank you.
How much did you say?
Two hundred*
Here you are...
Sir, I don't have any change.
Keep it.
It will come handy when treating your mother.
Thank you sir. May God bless you two.
Amen.
Son... listen to me...
This is my card.
I'm a doctor, bring your mother to my clinic, I'll treat her for free.
Will you treat my mother for free?
Yes, I will.
Go on now.
May God bless you.
Shall we?
Don't you like flowers?
You shouldn't have bought it?
Why? Did I buy them for you to take a look at?
If not, then let me put it on you.
I'll wear it when I reach home.
Why would you wear them at home?
Auntie doesn't like it.
Who told you that?
Maheen said if one wear them in public then they might be cursed by a demon.
Maybe you are forgetting
that Maheen said this when single women wear these.
Because even demons have the respect to not go following married women.
But if anything like that were to happen...
then you can tell them that you're married. And that I'm married
angry man who isn't afraid of fighting.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you should stop being afraid of mother's anger.
Meaning?
Meaning, my mother's anger is like your love. It comes and goes instantly.
Shall we leave now? We actually have to go and
get the phone. It won't be delivered to us.
Let's go.
Thank you so much. You take care of everyone so much.
They are my family, I have to take care of them.
When Mirha gets her new phone...
she'll be so happy.
I'm sure she will since you are gifting it to her.
Sir, will you have tea? Should I bring it for you?
Sure... tell me, is miss Razia home?
Sir... she came just a while ago.
Alright? What about Zaviar?
He left early in the morning.
Do one thing... bring me tea in the lounge.
Sure sir.
I want to talk to you
Go ahead I'm listening.
I went to visit Dolly.
So, what did she say?
She told me that your behavior isn't good with her.
What did you tell her?
What could have I told her?
You should have asked her why she was saying this.
She said that at Zara's wedding you didn't treat her well.
What? She told you that. Didn't you ask her...
how dare she slander me? Why didn't you ask her this?
What could I have told her?
That means that you believe that she's telling the truth.
Why do you believer her? She could lie
Why would she lie?
Then why would I treat her badly?
It would be better that you answer me.
What animosity do I have towards her?
You will get your answer, once you answer this question.
Wait... where are you going?
I want an answer. Do you really think...
that I treated her badly?
No...
Ali... listen to me...
Ali...
What happened to him?
He didn't listen to me. Did you say something to him?
What do you mean I said something?
He was standing here that's why I'm asking you what happened.
Mother, what can I say? I didn't talk to him about anything that would make him react like this.
You two were standing here. He left without responding me.
I'm asking you because you were standing here.
Did you say something to him?
I didn't say anything to him. What do you want from me?
I'm right in front of you making my salad.
Focus on working and keep people away from the sharpness of your tongue.
Really, then do one thing, take this and cut out my tongue.
Maybe then you'll be relieved.
But let me tell you something. Even the people who can't speak have a language.
They can say a lot, even without saying anything.
It's pointless talking to you. Did you talk to Zara?
No.
After her wedding, this is the first time she's left home. Thank God...
that auntie didn't tag along with them.
Your aunt isn't foolish enough to go out with them.
She's quite skeptical and can cause a lot of trouble.
Don't say such things.
Only eight days have passed since their marriage, may God keep them happy.
I didn't say anything. You started it.
Forgive me, I asked by mistake.
Now hurry up, your father will be here any moment now.
Sure.
Hey you're back and you didn't even tell me.
Keep it here.
You can go.
What's the matter Alam? Don't say such things in front of servants.
They have a habit of exaggerating things
Where did you go?
I went to a friend's house who had arranged a kitty party.
When did you come from finishing your work?
I've been back for a while now.
I was in my study room.
You and your study.
You can try giving me some time as well.
I will.
I will give you some time as well.
But you're busy somewhere else right now
Yes you know very well.
Like how you partake in doing social work, similarly I like partaking in social gatherings.
Mr. Alam, I wanted to talk to you.
Sure.
Go ahead, what is it?
I wanted to tell you that the land in Hyderabad...
What do you think about selling that land to buy a house in Karachi?
What? How is it possible? What are you saying?
You're asking me to sell that land.
Yes, what's so wrong with that?
And do you know that everyone in the party was discussing...
that how they can save their money by buying a house at a good place in Karachi.
Besides, what will we do with that land.
Neither you or Zaviar have time. Who will look after it?
I think the best option is to sell that land and buy...
a bungalow in Karachi.
Strange...
It's been three years since we left Karachi and you...
still haven't forgotten it.
Karachi isn't a place your forget.
We've spent a long time together there. We got married there as well.
How can we forget Karachi?
We spend good times there, we have so many fond memories there.
We can't forget them. What's so wrong with leaving this place?
Look, the people here needs educated people like us.
So that we can teach them about this world and also our religion.
God has given us that capability...
We should be thankful of God...
You and your good intentions...
Tell me, are you selling that land or not?
I cannot make any decision without talking to Zaviar.
What need is there to ask Zaviar?
His mother...
bought that land for Zaviar. I have to ask him.
I don't understand what you're saying. Don't we have any rights over Zaviar?
Look, looking after something doesn't make it yours...
and I cannot be unlawful towards anyone's possession.
Do one thing, there is no need for you to talk to Zaviar. I'll talk to him.
Drink your tea.
Thank you.
Enough Mr. Ahmad. You care about your petty accounts.
I'm saying something to you. Listen to me
You're talking to the wrong person.
What you're saying has nothing to do with me. It's his problem and he should resolve it himself.
What should I talk to Adeel about? He will try to find a solution for this in his medical text books.
Make him understand, he just got married. He should come back home before sunset.
There are a thousand bad things that can happen outside.
And that girl doesn't have the habit of putting a veil over her head.
Alright fine. I'll talk to them when they come back.
Very kind of you.
But there is one little problem.
What's the problem with this?
What if they ask me...
about the women who live abroad, who don't wear veils and scarves. And how they don't find themselves attached to demons?
What will I answer them?
I don't care.
Women who are abroad aren't Muslims. So are the demons.
What difference does it make if they cover their heads or not.
It's enough for them if they were complete clothes.
If you don't want to talk then let me know.
If something happens tomorrow, no one will say anything to you tomorrow.
The people will taunt me that I didn't teach the kids anything.
That's why I'm saying this to you.
I do have a solution for this.
What?
Why don't you buy a fully body burqa for Zara?
Have that made for her.
She'll wear it before leaving home. That way she'll be safe.
Instead of a shuttlecock burqa, shouldn't I buy her a disappearing cap?
That way I wouldn't be able to see her.
Did you say anything?
No. Keep managing your accounts.
I'll do the rest myself. Let your son and his wife come back.
You won't be able to do anything.
God have mercy.
Tea.
If you hadn't come today it would have been the third day.
Were you missing me?
I was wondering...
whether or not you'd be coming here.
Why are you saying that?
Because Zara has left.
You think that I only came here because of Zara.
I said no such thing.
You also didn't say what you wanted to.
I don't want to say anything.
Are you upset with me?
If I get upset with you...
then what will you do to cheer me up?
What will I do?
I'll jump off the roof. I'll die but I'll cheer you up.
If you say such things I'll throw you off the roof.
And I won't let you die.
Saad... it is possible...
that you don't need to cheer me up.
That can only happen if you don't get upset with me.
That can only happen when you don't let me cry.
I promise you...
that I will never let you break.
Drink your tea.
I don't know if it's good or not because Zara didn't make it today.
It's very good.
Thank you.
God rest your grandmother's soul, I didn't leave this house for a month.
But men and women nowadays don't care at all. They are out with each other, hand in hand.
Saad...
Yes...
Wait, I want to talk to you
What is it?
Look...
Send Dolly my message.
Tell her If she has a problem with me then she should talk to me.
Stop complaining about me to Ali. She won't gain anything by doing that.
What do you mean? Did she say something?
She'll tell you that. I just wanted to give you this message.
Farewell.
Greetings.
Tell me you two...
Is this anytime to come back home?
I've been waiting for so long... do you guys care?
You knew mother.
I did.
But I didn't know that you would spend the entire evening outside.
I told you that you two just got married and to return home before sunset.
No one in this house listens to me. I was getting so many bad feelings.
Why are you looking at her? I'm telling you...
What will she tell you?
When I got married...
got have mercy on your grandmother's soul, I didn't step out for a month.
But the men and women nowadays, may God have mercy!
They don't care, they are out with each other, hand in hand.
What is this?
Why are you wearing this? God help you! Do you want demons latching on to you?
You just got married, one shouldn't wear this.
Did your mother teach you anything before sending you here?
Mother doesn't believe in this. Before sending us out...
she just prays for our well being, but if you don't like them I'll take them off.
Wait Zara.
There is no need for you to take them off.
What's the matter with you mother?
What are you saying? People with weak faith say such things.
And I've never seen or heard that newly married couples can't go outside.
As far as flowers are concerned, they can be found in a lot of places.
Are you saying that demons are everywhere? What are you saying?
If you haven't seen anything, or you don't know it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
My mother used to say that Kumar was married in old Dehli
and every evening he used to seat his bride on a donkey and...
For God's sake mother, enough!
People might have believed in this in the past, but people don't anymore.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
It's alright Adeel. If mother doesn't like it...
I'll take these off...
Zara.
Do you know what my mother taught me? She taught me to respect my elders.
She said that even if you're at a loss, I should listen to my elders.
Even if you don't like it.
Do you see? Why are you still standing there, listening?
She said so much and you didn't say a single word to her!
Is this all the respect I have in this home?
Since you've started walking, start doing your work.
I've brought these from the roof... fold them!
I didn't ask you to take these off? You brought them on your own.
If I hadn't the birds would have spoiled them and I would have to wash them again.
Fold them!
Why are you talking to me like that nowadays?
Just because you do chores for me?
You know very well why I'm talking to you like this.
Why are you interacting so much with Zara?
Mother and I don't talk to her without reason. Then why do you?
I don't go to her, she comes to me.
And why does she?
And you're so stupid that you can't see. She is using you to manipulate Adeel.
But you're a fool and you don't understand anything.
What have I done Mahi?
You don't know what you've done?
I could hear you two laughing all night yesterday.
You've become such good friend's right?
Mahi...
Shut up!
I don't like you being friends with Zara.
Distance yourself from her, otherwise it will take me no time to set you straight.
That unfaithful lover of yours...
I haven't told anyone about him.
Are you blackmailing me?
I'm not blackmailing you. I'm trying to make you understand, so understand.
Your problem is with Zara, so why are you saying this to me?
There's a famous saying... the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Under the current situation, it's very funny.
Because I have my enemy's secret.
Do you understand?
Distance yourself from Zara, otherwise you won't be able to forget what I do with you.
Brother, you're back early?
Yes, why?
You never come back so early.
Is it because Zara isn't there?
Who told you there that I went there just for Zara?
Really, then why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
Where's mother?
She just went to sleep. Should I bring tea for you?
I had tea before I came home.
Tell me, did Ali come here?
Ali didn't come here, why?
No, I was just asking. He wasn't there, so I thought he was here.
No... he didn't come here today.
Is everything alright at home? Is Zara happy?
She's happy... Adeel is there to keep her happy.
Zara isn't there, I'm sure you miss her, that's why you came back early.
Who told you that I'm missing her?
I can see it on your face.
It's not like that.
I had something to take care of that's why I came home early.
Really....
Let mother know that I'll be back home late at night.
Okay.
Zaviar my son!
Yes aunty.
My dear... you're still up.
I can see that you've been returning home late, from work.
Is everything alright?
We have an important project at work and the deadline is near.
I want to complete that project. Did you have something for me?
Oh yes, I forgot. I came to talk to you about something important.
Sure, what is it?
Zaviar, I have never differed between you, Farah and Aryan.
Of course.
But ever since Aryan has married abroad your uncle has been a broken shell of a man.
He isn't strong like he used to be.
I don't want him working anymore.
He's old as well, how much more will be manage alone?
I ask uncle the same thing as well.
Talk to your uncle and make him understand.
Ask him to sell the land in Hyderabad.
Pardon?
Do you object?
No I don't, but mother...
I know your mother gave you that land. But time has changed.
That place doesn't have the same value as it did before.
I advice you to sell that land and find a place in Karachi.
But auntie, only uncle can take that decision.
I've never interfered in such things.
Uncle has always looked after them.
It's settled then. I'll convince your uncle.
You have no objections, right?
No I don't...
Bless you, I expected this of you. You never say no.
It's very late, you should rest now.
Who is it?
It's me Mirha.
Sister...
Look at this.
Look what I brought you.
What did you buy?
Look.
You bought a mobile for me! 
Thank yo so much! You're the best!
What is it?
Thank you...
I should be the one thanking you. Thank you!
When you talked to brother Adeel about my phone, did he say something to you?
No, what could he have possibly said?
I'm sorry... you must be tired. You should rest.
I was reading, a bunch of work has piled up during my time off.
Go ahead and study then. If you need anything, let me know.
Thank you.
It's okay.
Did you give Mirha the phone?
Yes I did.
Alright. How did she like it?
You should have told her that you were the one who bought her the phone.
For us, all that matters is Mirha's happiness.
What difference does it make if you give her the phone or I do.
Yes, you're right about that.
You've started to mold yourself in my colors.
Shall I say one thing?
You shouldn't have talked to mother like that.
You shouldn't have answered her like that. I was talking to her.
I just said it to auntie. I'm sorry if you didn't like it. I'll apologize to her as well.
What do you mean?!
I'll apologize, I'll apologize to auntie as well.
Listen to me... I was joking.
Why are you getting so serious?
Your joke scared the life out of me.
Don't say that again.
I pray that you get my life as well.
Adeel!
Whatever you said to mother was right.
I don't know why mother exaggerates everything. We weren't that late.
It's nothing Adeel. All she said was out of worry.
Moving forward we'll be careful. We won't stay out late.
What do you mean?
I'm here, I'll talk to father.
He'll make her understand.
You won't say anything to uncle. I don't want things to be blown out of proportions.
Alright fine, I won't. I promise.
You could at least wear these.
There aren't any demons around here.
I know I'm very bad at putting these on, but I'm trying.
See.
Perfect.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
They look very nice.
They're pretty, but not more than you.
