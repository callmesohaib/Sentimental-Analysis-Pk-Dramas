Hello aunty.
Hello Saad.
Its good that you're here.
What happened aunty? Is Zara alright?
Zara isn't fine, dear.
She has been continuously crying, missing Adeel, since last night.
She hasn't eaten anything. I took breakfast for her but she didn't even eat that.
She's talking weirdly. I don't understand what to do.
Its good that you came.
Go and check up on her. Sit with her. Maybe she'll settle down.
I'll talk to her aunty. I'll make her understand.
May you live long my child. May God keep you happy.
May you be healthy. Go..
I'll go and make her understand.
What drama is this? Why aren't you taking your medicine?
How will you get better if you don't take medicines?
I don't want to get better.
Why?
You know everything, Saad.
I know the Zara who was a lioness.
She was stubborn, mischievous and wanted everyone to do her bidding.
You're not that Zara.
She isn't as brave as she was before.
This Zara has lost.
This is what you think.
Even you think I'm wrong, Saad.
I don't think this at all. I trust you.
Trust? You trust me?
Then why did you bring me here? Why didn't you prove it to everyone that I didn't do anything. I wasn't at fault!
Tell me. Answer me, Saad.
Zara, we don't offer clarifications to everyone.
Then what should I do? What should I do? How can I clear the accusation to my name?
How can I tell everyone that I'm not at fault.
We don't make everyone believe us, Zara.
Your family trusts you. I trust you.
You're here. How are you?
Hello uncle.
Hello. He's here. Saad..
Really? Where is he?
Where would he be? In Zara's room.
Zara's room?
Of course. When you're not at home, he's in Zara's room.
Keep an eye out. The world is dangerous. What if someone else takes your place?
Isn't it?
Now I'm leaving. Alright?
I'm leaving, okay?
You'll have to forget everything, Zara.
Its not easy, Saad.
I'm here with you.
I'll help you forget everything.
Is it written in my life that I'll lose my loved ones?
Of course not.
Then why did everyone leave me?
I'm here with you.
I'll always be with you.
Are you telling the truth, Saad?
Promise me, you'll not ever leave me?
I've lost Adeel. I wouldn't want to lose my friend too.
It won't happen. Ever.
I'll always be with you.
Saad..
You're here?
You didn't tell me you didn't go to office today.
Actually, I wasn't feeling well today.
Also I didn't meet Zara yesterday so I didn't go that's why.
If you had to come home, you could have picked me from the university.
I didn't remember it at all.
Zara, are you alright? You must be now..
You look pretty awake.
Did you eat anything?
I've been trying to make her understand that she needs to eat and not worry.
All of us are with her. You make her understand.
Yes. Saad is absolutely right. You need to take care of yourself.
And the next time I come, I don't want to see you on the bed. Understand?
Zaini? Zaini?
What happened dear? I've been calling out your name since long.
Mom, I didn't hear you at all.
Saad is here, did you meet him?
He's in Zara's room.
I sent him there.
Why did you?
What are you saying?
Nothing.
I felt supported after Saad came.
I couldn't even understand what to do.
I couldn't see her worried. You were not at home, nor was your dad.
I thanked God.
You love Zara so much?
You get so worried seeing her in pain.
I'm a mother dear.
I won't be able to see anyone of you in pain.
Why didn't you meet Saad? Did you two fight again?
No. I didn't fight with him.
He should have time to argue with me.
Alright. Get up. Lets serve lunch.
Mom, I'm tired right now. I want to rest.
Oh. Its lunch time.
Saad, is here. I'll not let him go without lunch. Now get up. You can rest later
Alright.
Lunch is served. Come.
First you sit here. Lets fix her mood.
Why? What happened to your mood?
You're weird. Is this even a question?
Then you ask. Maybe Zara doesn't feel like talking.
It can never be. Tell her, Zara.
You'll make us fight now.
Saad, please. Stop it.
This doesn't cheer me up anymore.
I was just kidding to make you laugh.
She doesn't feel like talking. Don't bother her, Saad.
Come, have lunch. Zara, you come too.
I'm not hungry. Both of you go.
You also come with me.
Saad, I told you, I'm not hungry.
Do one thing. Get lunch here. We'll eat together and I'll see how she doesn't eat.
Why are you being stubborn, Saad?
I want to be alone for a while. You go with Zaini.
Zara?
Saad please...
You come for lunch. Come.
Alright, you get some rest.
Yes, I know. Zara is worried.
Even I know that. That's why I was trying to cheer her up.
First, you need to make yourself normal.
Have you seen yourself? You look tensed.
I'm fine. Its alright.
But I'm worried about you.
You feel the pain others feel but think about yourself as well.
Did I tell you a joke? Tell me.
Did I tell you a joke that you're laughing so much?
You get so typical.
Its not funny. I'm really worried about you.
When did I deny this?
I wasn't joking.
I'm worried because you're worried and you're laughing at it.
I am not laughing at your worries.
Alright.
You should leave now.
Zaini, I wasn't laughing at you.
I'm fine. Why do you worry?
Where is Zara?
She's in her room.
What are you thinking?
Zara's not fine.
She doesn't eat or drink anything.
She's only missing Adeel.
When I see her in this condition, my heart is torn apart.
If something happens to her, Manzoor, what will we do?
God forbid that something happens to her.
If you keep crying like this, it'll be very difficult for her to step out of this phase.
We need to take care of her physical and mental health.
What should I do? I cannot see her in this condition.
Give her some time. She'll not get out of this trauma so easily.
She was patient at the loss, her fate gave her.
But I cannot be patient at all this.
When we have nothing in our control, we have to leave everything on time.
Who would have done it? And why?
I don't know. Whom should we ask?
Forget it as you'd forget a nightmare. The worse has passed.
If you scratch at it, we'll be ridiculed. I don't want my daughter to turn into a spectacle.
If things go out, people will ask questions.
I trust my daughter completely, Manzoor.
Even I trust her but how would I make people trust her?
Whatever is done, its best if we leave it buried in the streets of Hyderabad.
Its no easy. It isn't.
Its not difficult too, Sarwat.
You'll just have to try.
You'll not repeat anything to Zara.
Whatever is done. Its best to bury it.
Beautiful..
Thank you Adeel.
My pleasure..
Now you don't have to worry.
I got you married to my son even when I didn't want it.
And you'd be like this?
Never in my wildest dream did I think you'd be like this.
You forgot Adeel so soon? You didn't even care that you were a widow.
Saad told me about Zara.
But I didn't dare meet her. How is Zara now?
She's better. Her fever is broken but she keeps crying.
Of course.
She'll settle down gradually. She'll be at peace.
You have to pray for my Sara.
She has seen a lot of hardships.
You don't have to say this. I've always prayed for your children alongside mine.
I don't know, who has cast an evil eye on us.
God will have mercy. Don't worry.
I'm worried about Zara too.
She's like a daughter to me. I've always taken her as my daughter.
And seeing her in pain, hurts me as well. I've always seen her smiling but now..
It seems she has forgotten how to smile.
Dear, go and call Zara.
No. Let it be. We'll go and meet her. Lets go.
Zara? My dear.. My life..
Stop it my child. Be patient my child.. God had willed this to happen.
Stop it my child...
Don't worry my child. All of us are with you.
Every man wants a child and its because of your negative thinking that our relationship is suffering.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fine. Give it to me. I'll keep it.
Is everything alright?
Yes. Why? What happened?
No.. Actually.. I had some work in the office so I got late.
The house is very silent. Has everyone gone somewhere?
Yes. I think aunty has gone somewhere.
Didn't you ask her where she was going?
She doesn't tell me where she's going and as it is, I don't interfere in her matters.
Tell me how is Zara now?
I couldn't talk to her. She was probably sleeping.
You can go and meet her.
Why are you looking at me like this?
No. Actually aunty might object so that's why..
Don't worry about her. I'll talk to her.
Will you not come with me?
No. Actually I have a new project in my office. There's a lot of work. I might not be able to accompany you.
By the way Maheen.
I have a dinner at my office and I'm invited. Everybody's wives will be attending.
Will you come too?
Of course. Why not? When do we have to go?
Next week.
Alright. You freshen up. I'll serve you dinner.
Yes this is so. Dolly, you're here for the first time since we got married.
How do you feel?
It feels good but I wish we'd have met in different circumstances.
I'm feeling bad for Zara, Ali.
Yes. Even we're worried for her.
Ali, we'll have to bring Zara out of this trauma. This won't work.
We're trying but its not an easy task.
Saad was telling me that Zara is mentally disturbed
Yes. She says whats in her heart to Saad.
But she doesn't talk to us because she knows we cannot see her like this.
Zara and my brother have been best friends. They share everything always.
Its because of Saad that we don't lose courage as well.
Ali don't worry. We'll pull Zara out of this difficult time together.
Thanks Dolly. You've supported my family a lot.
Your family is now my family Ali. You're forgetting. We're not just engaged anymore.
Yes. I had actually forgotten. You're my official wife now.
What about your work? When will you be rid of it?
I have a few tasks left. They'll be done with.
Weren't you resigning?
Yes. I did resign but I have a few commitments.
I told them I'd work online from here
but now it seems I should have sat there and wind up everything.
So what will happen now?
Nothing. I'll finish my tasks now. You leave it. Come, I'll drop you.
Are you telling the truth, Saad?
Promise me you'll never leave me.
I've lost Adeel and now I wouldn't want to lose my friend.
It will never happen.
I'll always be with you.
I'm breathing because Saad is here.
I couldn't understand what to do otherwise..
I couldn't see her worried. You weren't home neither was your dad.
I thanked God.
Its been so many days. How long will you keep yourself shut in your room?
I don't feel like doing anything.
Let that be, Zara. Whats done is done.
And whatever happened, we cannot stop our life because of it.
Dad and mom both are worried because of you.
If you shut yourself in this room, how will you pull yourself out of this darkness?
My life is darkness now.
Stop with this nonsense. If not for yourself, at least care about others.
Why are you here?
To make you understand that whatever you're doing is wrong.
Don't come here to make me understand. Leave me be.
Who are you doing all this for?
You sitting and crying here will make no difference to anyone.
How can someone be so untrustworthy so fast?
They were my family.
They weren't your family and they can never be.
This is what we tried to explain you earlier as well.
And even now you're repeating the same thing.
If you still don't stand up for yourself, you'll get buried under this burden.
What should I do then, Maheen?
Don't do anything. You don't have to do anything. Just,
throw out everything from your mind. Try and be normal, Zara.
Do you want mom and dad to be stressed because of you?
Then get up and come outside. If you sit with everyone, you'll feel normal.
Zara, come outside. Come on, get up.
Come on..
Its been so many days we're meeting again, Nusrat. Last time I met you at Asifa's house and its been long..
Yes.
My husband isn't well these days and I'm busy with the house work.
So, tell me how are your daughters?
They're fine by the grace of God.
So, is Maheen here or is she back home?
Maheen went back to her house but she's here today.
She's making tea for you.
Alright. And hows Zara?
Zara is fine as well. She's here as well. She'll come and say hello to you.
Alright.
Is it this or are you hiding something?
What do you mean?
You're acting as if you don't know anything.
What? What are you trying to say?
I heard that your daughter has an affair with someone and her in laws threw her out.
Tell me clearly. What are you trying to say Nusrat aunty?!
Maheen.. you go dear. I'm talking to her. Go..
Who told you this Nusrat?
Sarwat, everybody knows and,
Sarwat, such things don't stay hidden.
I didn't believe my ears thats why I came to ask you.
Aunty, are you here to ask or inquire?
Go away Maheen. I'm talking. You go.
She's weird. She'll say anything in front of anyone.
Take her inside..
Sarwat, your daughter got angry without a reason.
I know your daughters since they were children. I didn't trust anyone.
Yes, they grew up in front of you. All my daughter.
In front of your eyes. If they have been like this.. Zara,
she is the simplest in all my daughters.
You'd know if she was like that. We ourselves don't know what happened.
We just got a call from her in laws that we should come and get her.
We ran like crazy people and when we saw our daughter's condition there..
What can I tell you? I swear I don't understand. Who planned all this?
If they wanted to throw out our daughter, they could have told us.
Who did she have there? She lost her husband long ago. She had a child..
You're right. People are something on the inside and something else on the outside..
Why did you have to talk to strangers about our family?
Why shouldn't I? God knows what she'll tell people to get their sympathy.
She has nothing else. We have taken everything.
Oh well..
What will you do with this house?
I don't know. I'll rent it out.
Its my son's memoir. I'll not let you give it to someone.
Empty houses attract paranormal creatures. Its good someone will live there.
And we'll get money as well.
I don't need any money.
I'll keep them. As it is, its my house. I'll do whatever I please.
Whatever you're happy after taking..
It was my property that I gifted to Adeel
and I'll not let anybody take over it.
Adeel named that house to Zara and Zara will always have a right on it. Understand?
Whats your problem, dad?
Why do you keep chanting Zara? She has left. Why do you keep taking her name?
Mahi!
How are you talking to your dad?
No. Let her speak. Let her.
Dad I'm just saying that Zara has left this house now and you do know what she did.
You two will believe what you saw but I won't.
My heart still says it was all a lie.
Who was that boy? Who planned it? The day I find out.. I'll not forgive anyone.
Why would someone plan? Who would have such animosity against Zara?
Hmm. This is what I'm thinking.
Who took out their animosity and why?
Enough. I think. You keep taking Zara's name in this house throughout the day.
I don't want to hear her name in this house anymore.
And you listen to me. If you take her name again, you'll see the worse of me.
You should stop it too, Farida.
Stop it. Its enough. Let her be.
You took matters of the house outside.
 Be afraid of the time will the stains of this ridicule will reach your own daughters.
God's justice is silent. Remember this...
