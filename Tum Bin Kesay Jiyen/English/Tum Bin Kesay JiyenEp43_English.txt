I don't understand what they are getting by doing this.
My daughter is here now, then why is she doing this?
She's only doing this to save herself.
So that no one can say, that she was a cruel mother-in-law
The woman that came here, was here to take revenge.
I cannot tell you how much she disrespected sister-in-law.
Don't even let me get started on Zara. She exposed everything about her.
Adnan has offered some advice.
Really... what is that?
About Zara's second marriage.
What?
Zara tell me what happened.
What's the matter with you? Tell me what it is.
Will you take me to Adeel's home?
What?
Did you call me here to ask this of me?
What will you do there?
I want to see uncle.
I want to talk to him. He called mother.
What was he saying?
I don't know, mother didn't pick up. Mother should have talked to him.
Lord knows what must have happened there.
Zara, forget about them.
If auntie didn't tell you then that means that auntie doesn't want you meeting them.
They are blood relatives. Our relationship won't end so easily.
What will you do there?
I will ask him why he didn't trust me and didn't listen to me.
That is nonsense. Do you think if you ask him he'll tell you?
He won't tell you the reason he didn't trust you.
Don't joke around. My wounds are still fresh.
Then why are you causing yourself pain?
Life is small.
And who will know that better than you?
Did we come into this world to provide people with explanations? Answer me!
Why are you being angry at me?
What else am I supposed to do?
I explain things to you in a loving manner but you don't listen to me.
Why are you causing pain to your family?
Do you think it brings them joy seeing you like this?
Answer me? Do you think seeing you like this brings them joy?
Saad, I cannot change myself. I have to live with the difficulties that exist in my life.
Losing hope is a sin.
Seasons change.
There is always light at the end of the tunnel.
At least try, forget everything and move forwards.
Will you take me to Adeel's home?
Alright Saad, I'll go myself.
If you try to go...
then this is the end to our friendship.
I will end this friendship.
Saad...
Think about it.
Am I important to you...
or your stubborn demand.
To me, you are very important.
Mother, when are they coming?
You're supposed to tell me that.
Then I'll do as you say.
I have no problem.
Invite them tomorrow. Tomorrow is Sunday, and it wlll be easier for them.
Yes, you are right.
Alright fine... I'll call Fakhra and invite them.
Greetings. Shall we?
By God's good grace you look lovely. You should dress up like this often.
Thank you auntie.
Mother, don't wait for us. We'll be late today.
Sure take your time. Don't worry about me.
Maheen... it's late, cover your head.
Sure alright. Farewell.
Farewell
I was on my way to you. I saw them together, I tried to tell you but you didn't listen.
I told you not to leave Saad and Zara alone. Now Zara has taken your place.
What are you saying?
There is nothing like that.
I saw them two smiling and talking to each other.
What can I do if you want to ignore the facts?
No... it cannot be like this.
If it's nothing like that, then why are you crying?
Do you think I won't know if you don't tell me?
Whether someone sympathizes with you or not...
I do and I understand your pain.
I have some work in the kitchen...
Wait and listen to me.
If you don't start walking the path that you don't want to walk on...
then someone else will. I admit that the path is difficult...
then if you don't change your mind, then you will regret it.
Hey!
Both sisters are stubborn, they don't listen.
Anyways... she'll listen.
The arrow is heading towards it mark, it will strike soon enough.
I've been looking for you and you're here.
What are you thinking about?
It's nothing...
I've noted something, you've been ignoring me for a few days.
I'm ignoring you?
Yes you are. Whenever I come to visit, you sit down to study...
When do you ever come here for me?
You come here for Zara...
What are you saying Zaini?
Before you didn't even come here, weeks used to pass...
Zaini I had a new job, I was burdened by work.
That's why I didn't come.
You were burdened by work? Are you not anymore?
You're upset with me, that's why you're saying this, right?
No... I'm not upset with you...
then why are you being so rude?
I'm not being rude, leave, I have to make dinner.
I'll help you... I'm an excellent chef...
I don't want any help from you, leave.
I will help you.
Dolly...
Yes?
I'll be right there.
I'll get going, mother is not feeling well.
Father...
Yes..
Get up and take your medicine.
I don't want to... throw it away.
Father, then how will you get better?
What will I achieve...
by getting better?
Father... I cannot see you like this...
Brother Adeel has left us...
Do you want to leave us as well?
My dear child...
Enough father... now get up and take your medicine.
Get up...
I'm fine my dear...
What's the matter with her? What did the doctor say?
Her blood pressure increased, because of which she fainted.
But thank God she's fine now.
My dear, I'm alright, don't worry.
Thank God that you guys came back on time.
Nothing will happen to me.
Mother, you don't take care of yourself.
Auntie, what are you worried about?
I'm not worried about anything.
These things happen with time and age.
This will continue for as long as I'm alive.
May God have mercy mother!
Why are you worrying me stating such things?
My dear, one day all of us have to leave.
There's nothing big about that. For now, I'm fine.
Why are you saying such things? You are worrying him for no reason as well.
No auntie, this was my duty.
Thank you.
You've stood by us.
Will you thank me now as well?
Your mother is like mine.
Yes my dear...
Why not? You are my son.
And thank God that I have such obedient children.
Auntie, now rest... the doctor has asked you not to talk much.
If you don't take care of yourself, then your blood pressure can shoot up.
Dolly, take her inside.
Sure... come mother.
Sure my dear. I'll go and rest.
Saad left so early, didn't you stop him?
Dolly called... maybe auntie is not well.
Asfa is unwell. Why didn't you tell me? I could have gone with Saad.
Mother, I wasn't sure. Saad didn't say anything to me.
He left in a hurry. Brother Ali is there you can ask him.
I'll call him.
Don't call, let's go.
Brother Ali is here.
Greetings*
What happened? How's sister now?
She's better now.
What happened?
Mother, her blood pressure increased and she fell in the bathroom.
My God... she fell? Did she get hurt?
No, she didn't get hurt. It's good I was passing by when Dolly called.
There is nothing to worry about, right?
No there isn't.
What should we do? Should we go right now?
I think it would be better if we go tomorrow morning.
I liked them a lot.
What do you think?
I liked them as well.
I pray that we get an approval from them.
God willing, they will approve.
I liked the guy a lot. He's educated and sober.
Maheen...
What's the matter? Didn't you like them?
No auntie, if you guys like him, then it's fine.
Still, you must have an opinion.
Auntie, don't you think they were a little too demanding?
What do you mean?
I overheard Usama and auntie Fakhra talking...
She was talking about a house.
Maybe she's expecting that you guys will give them a house as a dowry.
Usama...
Why didn't you tell them?
No... we didn't talk about anything like that.
We were just generally discussing it.
Yes but I think that it would be better if you guys talk about it openly, just once.
We don't want to lose the opportunity to talk to them.
Mother, don't worry. Let them answer.. I'll talk to them.
How much more time will we keep Adnan here?
What are you saying?
Let's give this portion to someone else.
What's wrong with them?
They are not just tenants, rather they are our relatives.
They are you like your aunt and uncle.
They are not our blood relatives.
This was our main app, we pitched this to Mercedes.
On the front end we used word press, whereas in the back end we used Robulus.
And sir, one more thing...
This is the design we made and the client has approved it.
And this is all the coding. That's it.
Thank you sir.
Well done Saad, we liked your presentation very much. Keep it up.
Sir thank you so much for the opportunity.
You deserve this.
Thank you... that's all for today.
Thank you sir.
Saad... I didn't expect you would give such an amazing presentation.
Very good...
Shall we?
Please..
Zaini... you're here? Didn't you go with mother and father?
Why? Where was I supposed to go?
To visit auntie Asifa.
No... I didn't want to go there...
Alright.
You should have gone if you wanted to go with mother and father.
What would I do there?
Yes.
What would you have done there? Saad wouldn't be home.
He's at work.
Yes, he had a meeting.
He had a meeting... I didn't know about that.
He must have forgotten, ask him. He will like that.
When he thought it wasn't important enough to tell me,
then there is no point in me asking.
Zaini, I'm sure he forgot. I know he'll like it if you ask.
Zara, I think I know what he likes...
I'll talk to him later.
You can call and ask him about his meeting.
Are you alright Zaini? Is everything between you two?
Yes it is.
Why?
Did Saad say something to you?
No...
Saad didn't say anything. I was just asking.
When are you exams starting from?
Monday.
Alright... show me what you're studying.
Do you need help?
No, I don't need any help.
I can do it on my own.
Alright... fine...
I'm hungry...
I'll bring you something to eat. You want some noodles?
Hello
All the best.
You remembered it was my paper.
How can I forget? That's the reason I called.
It's because I couldn't come.
I'm happy that you remembered.
Are you still upset?
I wasn't upset before.
Zaini, I miss you.
You know how much I love you.
Saad, I'm running late, I have to leave.
You can go, but before you leave smile for me.
How will you see me smile on a call. It's not like we're on a video call.
I know that... but you are smiling, right?
You are smiling... that's what I wanted.
Okay... I'll get going now.
And yes...
thank you so much.
Take care and do good on your paper.
Farewell...
Bye... farewell.
Bless you.
Mother... I was thinking of finding a job.
What need is there?
No, there is no need.
But, I feel anxious being at home.
I start thinking of everything, even though I don't want to.
I did my masters and I want to put by degree to use.
But your father and I was thinking of something else for you.
What were you thinking?
We will tell you...
but I'll ask your father on how we can make you busy.
A job is all that has come to mind for now.
Is the tea alright?
Yes it is.
Greetings*
Adnan, where is Shaista?
I thought she was downstairs with you.
Maybe she needed something.
Zara, how are you?
I was passing by the kitchen and it smells amazing...
I think you're cooking something special.
Zara made all the food today...
It's settled then...
I'll eat lunch with you guys today.
Sure, why not? You are always welcome.
Seeing that tea in your hand, is making me desirable for one as well.
I'll bring one for you...
Sit down mother...
I'll send it for you.
Not too sweet.
Please have a seat.
Where's Shaista if she's not here?
Usama! Maheen! Come here you two!
Yes auntie?
Come sit with me... you too Usama...
Savera, bring it...
What's the matter? Is everything alright mother?
Yes... let it come.
Here we are.
Have some sweetmeats.
What is this for?
They have taken a liking for Shela.
Really... that's amazing!
Really?
Many congratulations.
To you as well.
They are good people... she called me and said...
that she against dowry.
She also asked me to start preparing for the wedding.
There is no need to do anything anymore...
Mother...
what about that thing?
No my dear... they just mentioned it.
You two should remove all doubt from your mind.
They are you honorable people.
I can't believe that we've found such a great family.
That's how lucky my daughter is...
I pray that...
God protects my daughter's fate.
Amen.
Did they say something else?
They will be here on Saturday.
Mother, propose an engagement to them.
No my dear... there's no need. It's a needless expense.
My sister is getting married. I want no shortage of anything.
We'll have all the functions and we'll start with the engagements.
Who will do it? It will be very expensive.
Don't worry about it mother.
Just invite them.
Alright, as you wish.
Pass the sweetmeat to Maheen.
Will you not eat?
How about you mother?
Come in.
What's the matter? What do you want to talk about?
I want to discuss something important.
What is it?
How long will we keep..
auntie Shaista and uncle Adnan in this house?
Huh? What are you saying?
We should give rent out this portion to someone else.
What's wrong with them? They are not just tenants...
they are our relative. They are your aunt and uncle.
They are not blood relatives.
They are more than that to me.
Why don't you understand?
What's there to understand?
Maheen said such things. She always spoke against them, not you. What's gotten into you?
Sit down, I'll explain it to you.
I will not... because it makes no sense.
Remove it from your head.
As long as your father doesn't want them to leave, no one can remove them from here.
Mother!
What's the matter? Why the long face?
We won't stay here anymore.
What's wrong with you? What are you saying?
No one's happy that we're here.
Did someone say something?
No, but I just overheard...
What did you hear?
Zara told sister that we should leave.
Zara... what else did she say?
She said that...
I think you have it wrong... Zara cannot say that.
No brother, I overheard her talking to sister
Sister tell him... tell what Zara said to you.
Is what she saying true?
Yes...
You know very well...
what she's going through. I can't even say anything to her.
I can only apologize...
Brother, why are you apologizing to us?
You are our elder... you have done us a lot of favors.
Don't do this.
Shaista is right... you are embarrassing us.
We know that Zara is mentally stressed.
And we didn't come here to complain, rather we came here to tell you...
that we have never tried to take advantage of you. 
Because of our poverty and unemployment....
we are forced to live in this house of yours.
Adnan, you have always stood by me like a little brother.
I know that you have no ill intentions...
Brother, it is because of this trust I talked to you that day openly...
But you didn't answer me, so I thought you didn't like my advice.
 That's why I didn't say anything.
It's not like that. Sarwat and I thought about it.
We think that right now isn't a good time.
What are you talking about?
About Zara's wedding. Adnan was the one who advised it.
What?
You guys want to get Zara married again?
So soon?
No...
not so soon but...
But it doesn't hurt to think about it, especially if we find a good match.
Sister, don't worry. I'm here to find a good proposal for Zara.
No.
No need for that. Let me talk to Zara first,
 because she doesn't like you living here.
If she finds out that this is your idea...
then she will never agree to it.
Besides she could never given Adeel's place to anyone.
Zara.
My dear come...
I wanted to talk to you father.
Sure...
I was thinking of finding a job...
Job?
Yes.
But... we were talking about your wedding here.
