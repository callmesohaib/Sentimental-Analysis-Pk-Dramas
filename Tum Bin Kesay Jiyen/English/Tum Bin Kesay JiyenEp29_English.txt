I did wrong. I shouldn't have raised my hand. What did I do?
I've given her a chance to act as the victim.
How could I make such a big mistake? I should have controlled.
Mom is right. What should I do now?
Hamza is also here.
Mirha?
Yes?
Are you busy?
No. Tell me.
Actually, Mahi is worried for you. She wants to meet Aquib.
What will you do about it?
What do you want? Should I make her meet Aquib and get him insulted more?
And, you know Mahi. She'll speak whatever she wants to.
She hasn't even met him and termed him a robber. What will she do when she meets him?
And, I'll handle my problem myself. You should leave it.
Mirha, its just not your problem.
Whatever you're doing isn't right.
What did I do wrong? Is it wrong to like someone?
And you please don't say this.
I don't say that its wrong or bad to like someone.
Its your right to like someone but..
But what?
I know everything Mirha. The day Mahi came in my room, I heard everything.
You tell me, is it right to meet someone secretly? Or lying to everyone..
He came himself. I didn't call him.
Why did he come so late at night? Does he not respect you? Doesn't he care?
What do you mean?
Listen to me, its not Aquib but Mahi who insulted me. She accused me.
And why are you supporting her? Was I running away with him?
Mirha, what are you saying?
Can you hear yourself? Its not something small.
You can tell mom, dad.. whoever you want to tell.
You can defame me
Why would I defame you? Do you think I would do that?
If I had to tell uncle and aunt, would I talk to you sitting here?
I'm just trying to make you understand Mirha.
All of us are worried for you. We want to know who is that boy?
If you're serious, make us meet him. We want to know what sort of a boy is he.
I'll never let Mahi meet him.
Should I make you meet him?
That's it? You would have no answer to it.
When you're telling me you should all meet him, do it then. Whats wrong with you now?
Mirha?
Zaviyar?
What am I hearing? You've said yes to the proposal?
Yes aunt. I wanted to surprise you that's why I didn't tell you.
I went away for two days and you took such a big decision.
You didn't even think it was important to ask me.
Aunt, please sit. I'll explain you.
I don't want to talk to you. You've disappointed me.
Aunt, I cannot even think about hurting you. But...
But what?
I liked Maheen.
Whats wrong Zaviyar? You'll get a hundred of other girls.
How will you adjust with that homely girl? And do you know?
Those people don't have any standards.
Aunt, I don't want any people obsessed with luxuries or materials in my life.
I want to live a simple life, like uncle.
What am I hearing? I'm surprised Zaviyar.
Do you even know what your saying? I've thought so much for you...
Aunty..
I care for your emotions but I liked her
Can you not accept it for the sake of my happiness?
See if you don't agree, I'll not get married.
But what if you get me married and I'm not happy with her either.
God forbid. What are you saying? All of us want to see you happy Zaviyar.
Then please agree.
You like Mahi so much?
Alright. Its up to you. I have no objections.
Thank you, aunt.
Hello.
Hello dear.
Hello.
I love my daughters very much.
Every father does that.
If I give my children the right to live their life so,
I don't allow them to snatch this right from someone else.
You're a good boy.
What should I I tell you more?
I'm looking at your trials.
I'm embarrassed in front of you as well.
Mr. Manzoor
I told you, you don't have to sit amongst us when we talk.
As a father, I'm forced to ask you,
to please discuss with Maheen.
Talk to her.
Together, decide about your life.
We'll accept whatever decisions you take.
No complaints or so. I promise you that.
I'm going with Osama.
Be happy dear.
bye!
You..
Have you thought it through before saying it?
No. It isn't necessary to think before taking a step.
Sometimes you have to step ahead earlier.
I'm asking you.
Yes, lets go.
Sure.
May God take care of you, my child.
I shouldn't have come like this. What did I do?
That Dolly has turned everyone to her side telling them fake stories.
What do I do without even thinking?!
Mom water..
Mom, Maheen is here.
Hello mom..
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
Absolutely fine. How are you?
I'm fine as well.
By the way, how long are you staying here for this time?
Mom..
What do you mean? Why are you amazed at my return?
I'm not amazed. I'm awestruck seeing you here.
I am thinking whether you came here yourself or whether Usama made you accept it.
I came here myself, aunty.
Its good. Better late than never.
Elders say that a girl is respected truly in her husband's house.
Otherwise a girl is just like a guest in her parents' house.
Now since you're here, try to take this house and this family as your own.
If your lectures are over, can I go to my room and rest for a while?
Yes, Maheen. You go to your room. I'll bring your bags.
She hasn't stopped answering back.
I thought she'd be fine now.
Why is she here, by the way?
Mom, this is her house as well.
You're right. This is a house. Not a guest house.
She cannot come and go back to her house as she pleases.
I thought, since she's back after ages, she'll have some sense knocked into her. But she's still the same.
She should have come and apologized to mom.
Apologize? For what?
Oh come on. When my own son is at fault, why should I complain to others?
Whats wrong with you people? Mom she just came back. How are you talking to her?
If you keep talking to her like this, she won't be able to adjust.
Girls learn to adjust in all kinds of situation and your wife isn't a newly wedded bride that you're supporting her like this.
You've been married for 4 years.
Listen to me. I'm not the type of mother who complains to her son about her daughter in law.
You know Maheen and me very well.
She is back with something in her mind. She's here for a reason.
Look at her. She's back to create new dramas.
Mom, drink water. Let it be. Whats wrong with you?
Be quiet. You're always supporting her.
You've always acted like her shield, ever since she was a child.
So what are fathers for?
But I didn't like it. To bow down in front of our son in law.
This is your love, Sarwat. But you were looking at your husband.
If you had seen a helpless father, you wouldn't have disliked it.
Maheen is our daughter and its our responsibility to bring her life back on track.
I don't want her to commit a mistake that'll make her regret.
I'm thinking what would have happened if she hadn't gone back with Usama even today.
Maybe it would have been her last meeting with Usama.
What are you saying? Would you have kept your daughter at home for all her life?
What else could we do?
Where are you going?
I'm going to offer prayer of gratitude, what else?
Yes, thank God that Maheen went to her house herself.
Why are you smiling?
You're so scared of Maheen.
As if you don't know how bold and stubborn she is.
Oh I know my daughter. This is why I was surprised.
But I'm happy as well.
I'm just scared she'll be stubborn about something and come back home.
Don't argue with her anymore.
Why would I argue with her? God forgive me. I'd never do anything.
Offer your prayers and call Maheen. Ask them if they've reached or not.
ok
I'll call Zara and give her the good news as well.
Yes..
I'll go now.
Zara?
What happened? Why are you so worried?
Adeel...
where have you gone Adeel? Where did you go leaving me all alone?
I've not left you and gone anywhere.
I'm always with you.
The closest to you.
Don't cry.
If you'll cry, then I'll be in pain.
I have a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Zaini, we're both travelers of the same boat.
If one of us drowns, she'll take the other one along.
I mean.. If there will be a problem between you and Saad, it'll affect Ali and my relationship as well.
The number you're trying to call is busy at the moment. Please try again later.
Your phone?
Are you done talking?
Yes thank you. Actually my credit ended so I used your phone.
Its no problem.
She said her husband will come tomorrow to get clothes.
You know he's an old acquaintance.
Mom has always asked him to get our clothes stitched.
I don't need any new clothes. Please ask aunt to tell him not to come.
What happened? Why don't you need any new clothes?
As it is, your old clothes are very bright. You cannot wear them.
Did you mind?
I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that.
Are you upset?
No. I'm not upset at all.
Then why aren't you talking?
Yes, I forgot to tell you. You had a call when I was talking to someone. You should check.
Whose call was it?
Mom's message. Maheen has gone back to her house.
Oh God. Mahi you're here. I was looking for you everywhere.
Maheen has gone back to her in laws, mom.
What? How did this happen?
I mean, did her mother in law come to take her back?
I don't know. I'll call mom tomorrow and ask her.
Alright. Its a good thing. Daughters look good settled in their houses.
What happened to her? Oh alright. I brought this for you.
Eat this. You have to finish this.
Maheen, aunty is calling.
I know.
You're still upset?
It won't do anything good to make it up to me. And rather than sitting here and making up with me,
you go and make it up to your mom.
She'll already shooting me down with her taunts.
I'm trying.
I won't say anything. When nobody values me in this house, why should I even talk.
Maheen, whatever mom said, she said to me.
And why would someone say anything to you.
I am not mistaken. I'm not a child. I understand everything.
And even you should also understand.
I will not tolerate anybody wronging me. I'm back here but don't take it as my weakness.
If you had to do all this, why did you come back?
Dolly?
Why are you sitting here all alone?
Actually, its our last night here. So I thought I'd see my fill.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
This means, you're going to go directly to Islamabad with me from the marriage hall?
Why are you looking at me like this?
I'm asking for our honeymoon. Would you go?
Ali..
What if we don't get married?
What? Dolly, why are you thinking like this?
See.. I cannot live without you.
Why?
Listening to Maheen, I thought I could live without you.
But I was wrong.
I cannot live without you. I..
I'm afraid to lose you.
Dolly, nobody can drive us apart. We love each other.
Respect is the foundation for love.
Without respect, there's no value for love too.
Whatever Maheen did, I didn't tell anyone.
For your respect and for my mom's.
But Ali..
Don't I deserve someone talking for my right too?
Nobody asked her anything.
Nobody asked why did she change her decision and left all of a sudden.
See, Dolly give me some time. I'll fix everything.
If this storm doesn't settle down, then?
What if it drowns everything? What will you do?
Don't think like that. Trust me, I'll fix everything.
Leave everything and tell me why are you sitting here all alone, so late at night.
Its just that..
We'll go back tomorrow, I just wanted to sit alone for a while.
Did someone say something to you?
Then?
Mom says that its not a good thing for a girl to visit her in laws so openly before she gets married.
She's right as well.
Then, we'll make this house, your permanent house from tomorrow onwards.
Come on. Finish your tea.
I'll see what you were reading.
What are you doing?
yes?
What are you doing?
I'm looking for recipes.
I'll cook something good for Zara. See, I made breakfast for her as well. Is it good?
Have you lost your mind?
What sort of language are you using with me? I'm your mother.
I'm right.
Haven't you started pampering Zara too much?
Why shouldn't I? She's my Adeel's wife.
She is the mother of his child.
She's not his wife. She was. Perhaps you've forgotten that your son isn't alive.
And that's only because of your daughter in law.
Why are you so bitter Mahi? Why do you talk like this?
Stop with your dramas.
I'm not doing any dramas. My mother in law pampered me when I was expecting.
Zara is expecting now and I'm pampering her. Whats the drama in that?
Have you forgotten what Zara or her mother did to you?
Yes, I've forgotten everything. You also forget everything, for God's sake.
I will not forget anything, mom.
And remember one thing. Zara is in this house until I want her to be.
Don't be nonsense.
Zara is the daughter of this house and she'll not go anywhere.
So you'll taunt me because of her?
For God's sake. Forgive me.
Say whatever you want to say, to your father. I don't have time for all this.
She's made me crazy early in the morning.
What? What did you say? She left? Without anything? How could you let her go?
Look at her, she's gone completely crazy.
She hit you.
Its good that you answered her back.
It doesn't look like you're the daughter in law to be of this house.
You're so humble and kind.
How could she hit you? How dare she?
Adnan uncle..
I didn't want to mention this to you. Please keep it to yourself.
Finish everything here. As it is, we're going back to our house.
Why do you worry? Don't worry. I'll not tell anyone anything. You know how I am.
See dear, your Adnan uncle is with you.
Why do you worry? I'm here. Alright? I'll leave now.
Shaista, listen to me, Shaista. Listen.
I'm ashamed to even say this.
You were with Dolly.. I'm ashamed to even think about it.
You have lost your mind. Have you?
Enough. No more lies.
Tell me the truth, what were you doing with Dolly?
Listen to me with a calm mind.
No. I need an answer to my question. What relationship do you have with her?
What nonsense is this? Have you lost your mind?
Yes. I've lost my mind. I'm crazy.
Listen to me. I didn't call her, she came herself.
Sarwat send kebabs, she was here to give us that.
You're lying. You're lying.
I'm not lying. All kids of this house are like my own children. Whenever they're worried,
I'm worried. I'm happy when they're happy. I laugh and enjoy with them.
She was worried and I was just offering her sympathies.
Don't lie to me.
I saw everything with my own eyes. My own eyes.
Sometimes what you see with your eyes is a lie too.
Don't you believe your husband? Come down and ask yourself.
Maheen was hitting Dolly so I just sympathized with her. She was crying.
I don't need clarifications. Please leave.
Or else I'll leave.
You're taking me wrong. Me. I take all children here as my own.
I treat them with love and kindness and you're doubting me.
I look for my own kids in these kids
 I tend to make up for what I don't have with them and you..
You're accusing me of something so cheap. I'm ashamed of myself. You..
I have to do something. 
I will have to. 
First she snatched my brother.
Then dad.. and now she wants to snatch my mother. 
What is it about this child that even mom has changed?
I cannot tolerate this.
Maheen will laugh on me. I cannot let this happen.
I'll have to do something. 
I'll have to throw you out of this house, Zara.
I hate you people. I hate you.
