Uncle has strictly instructed us not to let you enter in this house alone.
It would be better for you to leave and come back with your family.
Who are you to stop me?
Why do you want to play with uncle's honor?
Who will scheme against you?
All of us took such great care of you. We loved you.
Why would we scheme against you?
If my son's name has been associated with your daughter's name....
then he should be married to her.
Zara should be married to Zara.
What are you saying mother?
Enough mother, how much more will you cry? Give her water
Mom, drink water.
Here mother, drink water.
We can't bring back the people who are gone.
You guys might have forgotten about Adeel...
but I can't.
That's what you think.
We miss Adeel as must as you.
Mother I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
You guys must think that I'm insane.
I'm not insane! What I say happens!
I ask you not to say outside for long hours...
Try and understand what I'm saying.
Mother... this was all the time brother Adeel was meant to be with us for.
You couldn't have possibly saved his life.
Are you insane? How are you speaking to mother?
Are you here to lessen her pain or increase it?
It's necessary for her to accept it.
Will you teach me between right and wrong now?
Alright fine. Mother...
you'll have to understand what I'm saying.
I'll often be late from university because of extra classes.
That doesn't meant that you'll cry about me.
If you do this, then how will I focus on studying?
Let her go mother. She's gotten used to being at the university.
She likes it now.
She won't get better, rather you should turn back two hours on your watch.
Do you really like provoking her?
Enough of that nonsense!
Mind you tongue, otherwise I'll snatch it off!
Enough!
Begone!
I don't know what's with you two. You two will never understand what a mother goes through!
Mother...
Get away from her!
Mother... quiet yourself.
Keep on crying then.
You guys don't know a mother's pain.
Father, you can't do this.
I promise that I will not look at Saad and will not talk to him ever again...
but don't do this to Zaini and me.
Listen to me father.
I don't want to hear anything anymore.
Nor do I want to give any opportunity.
I cannot tolerate anymore humiliation than this.
For a father if his daughters become his weakness...
then that is enough for a father to be buried alive.
Uncle what you're doing is wrong.
The time has passed for right and wrong.
Now there will be punishment.
Alongside you, all of us will be punished.
Then punish me... do whatever you want...
strangle me... but...
Even if you sacrifice yourself you cannot bring back the honor to this house!
If you want your father to die, then do as you wish.
No father...
Brother Manzoor don't take the wrong decision out of emotions.
Don't think of marrying Saad and Zara. Don't punish Zara!
You played this game...
don't talk in between.
Anyone can think whatever they want... and they can do whatever they want.
I cannot marry...
Not even for your sister's happiness?
What did you say?
You destroyed both of my sisters' lives!
Do you think I'll let your sister be happy?
What nonsense are you saying?
If you don't want this marriage to happen...
then you can take your sister away from here.
But remember one thing...
this will be our last meeting.
What's the matter with you Ali?
Silence yourself, why are you speaking nonsense?
Mother please, let me speak.
Is he cares about his ego so much, then I care about my house's honor as well.
An honorable man could go to any lengths for his sister's honor,
even if he has to sacrifice his happiness.
What's with you Ali? We are speaking, silence yourself.
Father please... if he cares about his ego so much...
then I care about my house's respect.
What's your decision now?
Ali... my dear this is unjust. You can't do this to my daughter!
Brother, how can I do this to Dolly?
Why are you dragging her into this?
Silence yourself.
I'm not speaking with you. I'm speaking with him... answer me!
If my sister can by punished then why not your sister?
That's what you said, right auntie?
If your son could get away with destroying my sisters' lives...
then we will not take long in breaking this relationship.
Ali...
Don't talk to me Dolly.
Whatever you want to say, say to your brother.
I didn't expect this from you Ali.
That's the only option you have now.
If you want your sister's relationship to remain as it is, then you'll have to marry my sister.
Saad agree... this is best for all of us.
Saad... because of your stubbornness,  my daughter's life will be ruined.
I beg you.... for God's sake agree to marrying Zara.
No mother... I cannot marry her.
Wait!
If you're leaving, then take your sister with you.
Otherwise I in my senses...
Ali!
Not one more word!
I accept it!
What's the matter? You didn't come down for dinner.
I don't feel like it.
Did someone say something to you?
No..
Then?
I don't know...
Nothing seems nice.
I don't feel like doing anything.
Mirha told me.
Look... if you stop eating...
then that will bring pain to Adeel's pain.
Don't cause yourself pain.
What else can I do?
What else can I do?
I miss Adeel.
Nothing seems nice.
Wherever I go I see Adeel and...
Forget it..
Forget it.
I've forgotten everything and moved on.
Forget it.
I've asked for a Quran gathering at the madrassa.
The children will be here tomorrow.
Alright.
We will offer food there as well.
I've arranged for it.
No...
We will offer it there...
but we have to give it at that place as well.
What place?
Where Adeel...
used to distribute food.
The place where...
he went to give food after his reception.
I tried stopping him...
but he didn't listen.
He never listened to me...
But what he did was great.
He had a soft heart.
He took care of everyone.
Anyways...
I'll ask Mirha to bring food for you.
Eat something.
Listen Ahmed...
What?
Forgive Mahi.
For me, forgive her.
She's our daughter.
Why did this happen? This shouldn't have happened.
Zara getting married to Saad! I wanted Saad...
to be ousted from this house forever.
But now, Zara will be marrying Saad.
I will not let this marriage happen.
I will not.
I will have to stop this marriage.
At any cost.
I also have a condition.
Condition?
What condition?
Zara will leave this house first, only then will Dolly return to this house.
What kind of condition is this?
Auntie...
I don't trust your son at all.
Sure..
We accept your condition.
You destroyed both of sisters' lives...
Do you think I'll let your sister have a life?
If my sister can be punished then why not your sister?
That's what you said, right auntie?
If your son can get away with destroying my sisters' lives, then we don't take long in breaking this relationship.
Maheen... I'm going home.
Why?
I need to do take care of things at home.
What will I say to mother and father?
They need me, you know what there position is.
And if you leave then I will have to leave with you.
So that's not a problem, I'll bring you back here tomorrow.
I can't leave, you've seen how Zaini is...
How can I leave my mother and father?
You're not leaving anywhere.
What will I do staying here?
I cannot stay... mother has called me a few times now...
Then tell her that my father, Ali and everyone else needs you here.
Can't you do this for us? You know how father got unwell yesterday.
Call auntie, I'm sure she'll understand. If you can't, then let me talk to her.
No I'll call her myself.
Alright... if she asks to come, please refuse.
Not only just your father, you embarrassed your entire family and proved...
that your father failed in carving out a diamond.
Who I thought was a diamond turned out to be an ordinary stone.
My dear why are you putting yourself in pain for him. If he was never yours...
then why are you crying for him?
Mother he was mine. Why did he betray me?
Why did he betray me?
Why did Zara do this to me? Why did she steal my love for me?
Why did she do this?
Zaini... my dear...
I will die without Saad mother.
How's Zaini feeling now?
She's crying alot. She's in pain.
I couldn't find the courage to go in front of her.
For a father, it's so hard to see tears in the eyes of his daughter.
May God protect all parents from this pain.
I'm an unlucky father...
Sarwat, if someone in the market I could buy a good fate for my children...
then I would have sold myself to buy them.
You have to control yourself.
Zaini needs us right now.
Yes, I have to control myself for Zaini.
I have...
She had such high fever.
I just gave her medicine.
What should I do? Should I take her to the doctor?
No... the fever will come down. We can't do anything but wait.
Tomorrow will be very hard for her... don't leave her alone for a single moment.
How will tomorrow pass?
I pray that it goes by without destruction.
Check in on her please.
Sit down, I'll bring tea for you.
Sit down for a few minutes.
I'll bring you some medicine.
Zaini...
Zaini...
Zaini, wake up.
You have a fever Zaini.
Get up and take your medicine. Your fever has increased.
Get up.
Zaini wake up.
You'll have to take your medicine, otherwise how will you get better?
Rest up... I have to take care of something with mother.
Fareeda, I've been here for ages and you aren't speaking.
I just don't feel well.
I want to rest for a while.
Go ahead, she's here.
Sure, sit with her.
It's good you're here auntie.
It was hard for me to find the time.
Sadaf told me that your mother wasn't feeling well.
That's why I came here.
After Adeel's death, mother has been very down.
Yes dear, I can understand. It's hard to forget one's son,
Of course.
How's your sister-in-law?
Who... Zara?
You had only one sister-in-law...
I'm sure she's fine.
You should check up on her. She was your relative.
She was... but we've cut all ties with our aunt.
Relationships aren't ended so easily, besides you have a blood relationship with her.
What are you saying? Let's talk about something else.
Why?
Find out what she's doing nowadays. Adeel's death anniversary is around the corner.
Are they thinking about marrying her?
Marrying her?
Oh yes... girls nowadays don's stay at home for long and your sister-in-law...
I think that she has forgotten your brother, that's why she didn't ask about anyone.
Please drink your tea.
Uncle, you have it wrong.
The time between right and wrong has passed.
Now there will be punishment.
Alongside you, everyone else will be punished.
Then punish me however you want. Strangle me...
Even if you sacrifice yourself you won't be able to redeem the honor of this house.
Mother sent this, change it.
Where is mother?Why?
I want to talk to her.
She doesn't want to talk to you. Wear this and come downstairs.
I will not wear these clothes.
Why are you creating a scene? Mother didn't choose to send you this...
Think that this is your coffin which you have selected for yourself.
If you guys hate me so much then what's the need for these theatrics?
Send me away as is...
We have to do this! Not all of us are like you.
Someone who doesn't are about her father or sister!
I'm keeping this here, be sure to wear it and come outside.
Find out what's she doing nowadays.
Adeel's death anniversary is around the corner...
Girls nowadays don't stay at home and your sister-in-law...
I think that she has forgotten your brother, that's why she didn't ask about anyone.
Try and understand my compulsion, I have to prepare for everything right now.
I cannot wait till tomorrow. Try and do it today, please!
I'll be waiting for you.
Father...
Father please don't turn away from me...
I cannot see myself falling from grace in front of you.
I don't want to talk to you.
Father why are you doing this? You have always believed me... then why...
What else can a father who is compelled do?
Zara the face we are born with...
is not our choice...
But surely we are responsible for the face we have when we die.
And that face represents our character.
You not only degraded your father, but also your family and proved...
that your failed in carving out a diamond...
What I thought was a diamond was an ordinary stone.
Father...
Don't do this father... I'll die! Don't do this to me!
Your father died long before you did!
This is your last day on in this house. Keep my respect.
Father... please listen to me
Mother... get up.
What's the matter with you?
We have to go now.
Where?
I'll tell you about it later, but get up for now!
Who will tell your father?
We'll say anything... but for now... get up.
What's with you? Where are we going?
Lord knows where you are taking me...
You ask so many question... come with me.
